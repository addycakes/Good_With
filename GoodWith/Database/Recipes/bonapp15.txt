  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FRITTERS ===
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  anisette liqueur -- plus
  1         tablespoon  anisette liqueur
  3        tablespoons  liquid nondairy creamer
  1 1/2    tablespoons  aniseed -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted margarine - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2               cups  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  anisette liqueur
  1         tablespoon  water -- more or less
                        Fresh mint sprigs
                        === COMPOTE ===
  2               cups  water
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  aniseed -- chopped
  6             ounces  dried apricots
     1/4           cup  anisette liqueur -- plus
  1         tablespoon  anisette liqueur
  1                     pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 3/4" cubes
  1 1/2                 baskets strawberries - (1 pint ea) -- halved
  6                     kiwi fruit -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" cubes
                        = (or 3 cups green grapes)

To make the Fritters:  Whisk together first 5 ingredients in small bowl; let stand 10 minutes.

Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl.  Using fingers or pastry blender, add chilled margarine to flour mixture and cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir egg mixture thoroughly into dry ingredients.

Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in heavy medium saucepan to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, drop batter by rounded tablespoonfuls into hot oil.  Cook until brown, turning occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Transfer fritters to paper towel-lined cookie sheet and cool.

Combine powdered sugar and 1/4 cup liqueur in small deep bowl.  Add enough water to make medium-thick glaze.  Dip fritters halfway into glaze.  Arrange fritters glaze-side up on plate.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)

Arrange 3 fritters on each of 8 plates.  Spoon compote alongside.  Garnish with fresh mint and serve.

To make the Compote:  Bring water, sugar and aniseed to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes.  Place apricots in medium bowl.  Strain boiling syrup over apricots.  Discard aniseed.  Add liqueur to apricots and stir.  Cover and let stand at room temperature until apricots are tender, about 8 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Add pineapple, strawberries and kiwi fruit to apricots.  Toss well.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

This recipe yields 24 fritters for 8 servings.

Comments:  Also called bimuelos, these are a typical Sephardic Hanukkah dessert.  The oil in which they are deep-fried commemorates the time during the second century B. C. when a vial of oil, enough for only one day, is said to have burned in the Temple for eight days after the Jews' victory over their Syrian oppressors.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

     1/3           cup  flat beer
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2                     catfish fillets - (4 to 6 oz ea)
  2               cups  purchased coleslaw mix
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Whisk 1/3 cup flour, salt, and pepper in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk in beer. Add enough oil to heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Heat oil to 350 degrees.

Place remaining 2 tablespoons flour on plate.  Coat fish with flour.  Dip in batter, letting excess drip off.  Fry fish until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes per side.  Drain fish on paper towels.

Toss coleslaw mix, vinegar, honey, and 1 tablespoon oil in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide between plates.  Place fish atop coleslaw.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Make this a new version of Britain's fish and chips with (frozen) steak fries.  Lemon tarts from the bakery would be good for dessert.

  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              pound  trimmed boneless center pork loin -- sinew removed,
                        cut into 1" chunks, well chilled
  3                     eggs
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  tawny Port
  3        tablespoons  dried currants -- minced
                        Lettuce leaves
                        Cracked peppercorns
                        Minced fresh parsley
                        Bay leaves
                        French bread baguette slices
                        === FOR THE CONFIT ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  red onions -- halved, sliced
  3        tablespoons  dried currants
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  canned chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 3/4 tspn dried thyme, crumbled)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Terrine:  Combine first 9 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Add 3 shallots.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat, cover and let stand 30 minutes.  Chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 7-cup pate or bread pan with plastic wrap.

Melt butter in heavy small skillet over low heat.  Add remaining 5 shallots.  Cover and cook until very soft, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to processor.  Add pork, eggs, flour and Port and puree.

Strain cream mixture, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  With processor running, add cream through feed tube and process just until combined with pork.  Transfer to large bowl.  Mix in currants.

Spoon mixture into prepared pan.  Cover with foil.  Place pan in large pan.  Add boiling water to larger pan to within 1/2-inch of top of terrine.  Bake until terrine begins to shrink from sides of pan and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours.  Uncover and cool on rack.  Chill until cold.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Line platter with lettuce.  Arrange terrine atop.  Sprinkle with pepper and parsley.  Garnish with bay leaves.  Spoon confit around sides.  Serve with bread.

To make the Confit:  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and saute until crisp-tender, about 8 minutes.  Add all remaining ingredients and stir until reduced to thick glaze, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This uses the same ingredients found in boudin blanc, the classic French white sausage.  Start two days before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4                     chicken breast halves with skin and bones
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               jars  marinated artichoke hearts - (6 oz ea) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  reserved artichoke marinade -- reserved
     3/4           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Add to skillet and sautÃˆ chicken until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons reserved marinade, broth, lemon juice, peel, and crushed pepper.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until chicken is almost cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Uncover; stir in artichokes and 2 tablespoons oregano.  Simmer until liquid is slightly reduced and chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Stir in 1 tablespoon oregano.  Season with salt and pepper; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  It's easy to keep the Greek theme going by starting with stuffed grape leaves, widely available at supermarkets.  Accompany the chicken with orzo and steamed baby carrots with mint.  Finish with purchased cheesecake.

     3/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped

  3              large  ripe bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut on diagonal into 1/4"-wide slices
  15             small  strawberries with stems

Add white chocolate; whisk until melted.  Mix in remaining 2 cups cream.  Chill until cold.

Peel and slice 1 1/2 pounds bananas.  Puree bananas with lemon juice in processor.  Mix puree into custard.  Transfer custard to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.  Spoon ice cream into prepared crust; smooth top.  Cover and freeze overnight.  (Can be made 1 week ahead; keep frozen.)

For Sauce:  Bring cream and syrup to simmer in medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to low.  Add chocolate; whisk until smooth.  Cool to lukewarm.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm over low heat before using; do not boil.)

Remove pan sides from torte.  Arrange bananas and strawberries in rows atop ice cream.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Giving a nod to tropical fruit, this irresistible treat combines rich ice cream with a nut crust and thick fudge sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTERCREAM ===
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  8             ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  toasted sliced almonds
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  6              large  eggs -- separated
  10       tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Powdered sugar
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)
                        Pine twigs
                        Candied Cranberries
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2           cup  cranberries

For Buttercream:  Whisk egg yolks, sugar and flour in medium bowl to blend well.  Bring half-and-half to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Slowly whisk hot half-and-half into egg mixture.  Return egg mixture to same saucepan and cook until mixture boils and thickens, whisking constantly.

Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  Add chocolate and orange peel and stir until mixture is smooth.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of pastry cream to prevent skin from forming.  Cool completely.  (Pastry cream can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Butter 11- by 17-inch jelly roll pan.  Line with parchment.  Butter and flour parchment.

Coarsely grind toasted almonds with flour in processor.  Using electric mixer, beat yolks with 5 tablespoons brown sugar in medium bowl until slowly dissolving ribbons form when beaters are lifted.  Stir in orange peel and vanilla extract.  Using clean dry beaters, beat whites with cream of tartar and salt in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 5 tablespoons brown sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into yolk mixture.  Gently fold in almond mixture.

Spread batter evenly in prepared pan.  Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Run small sharp knife around pan sides if necessary to loosen cake.  Slide cake on parchment onto rack.  Cool.

Slide cake on parchment onto work surface.  Loosen cake from parchment using knife as aid.  Sift powdered sugar over cake.  Invert onto cookie sheet.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and invert onto another parchment sheet.

Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in Grand Marnier.  Add pasty cream 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition until just blended.

Spread half of buttercream over cake, leaving 1/2-inch border.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up cake jelly-roll fashion.  Arrange seam-side down on parchment.  Set aside 1/2 cup buttercream; spread remaining buttercream over cake.  Cut 2 inches off each end of cake, cutting on diagonal.

Transfer cake to platter.  Attach ends to top of cake, forming branches.  Spread reserved 1/2 cup buttercream over cake ends and seams.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour to firm buttercream.  (Cake can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Let cake stand at room temperature 20 minutes before serving.)

Arrange pine twigs on cake and on platter.  Garnish with cranberries.

For Cranberries:  Cook 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Transfer to top of double boiler.  Add cranberries.  Cover berry mixture and place over simmering water.  Cook 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from over water.  Let cranberry mixture stand at room temperature overnight.

Place remaining 1/2 cup sugar on plate.  Drain cranberries well.  Add to sugar and turn to coat.  Let dry at least 30 minutes.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The bËšche de NoÃŽl, or Christmas log, was created in the late nineteenth century by Parisian pastry chefs, who were inspired by the real logs that burned on hearths throughout the night on Christmas Eve.  Our version can be decorated with Candied Cranberries or fresh currants.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  hazelnuts - (abt 5 oz) -- toasted, husked,
                        and cooled
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                cup  chilled unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  cherry preserves - (abt 18 oz)
                        = (preferably imported)
                        Powdered sugar -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.

Combine nuts and 1/3 cup flour in processor; finely chop nuts.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Add remaining 2 cups flour and next 5 ingredients to bowl; whisk to blend.  Add butter.  Using electric mixer at low speed, blend ingredients until coarse meal forms (this will take several minutes).  Add egg yolks and vanilla.  Beat until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball.

Press 1 1/2 cups (packed) dough over bottom and up sides of prepared pan; spread preserves in dough.  Roll remaining dough on sheet of parchment paper to 13- by 10-inch rectangle.  Freeze rectangle 5 minutes to firm.  Cut twelve 1/2-inch-wide strips lengthwise from rectangle.  Arrange 6 strips across torte, spacing evenly.  Arrange 6 more strips across torte in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Seal ends of strips to dough edge, trimming excess.  Reserve all dough scraps to make cookies, if desired.

Bake torte until crust is golden brown and preserves are bubbling thickly, about 40 minutes.  Cool torte completely on rack.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with foil; store at room temperature.)

Push bottom of pan up to free torte from pan.  Sift powdered sugar over edge of torte, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This jam-filled pastry with a cookie-like dough takes its name from the town of Linz.  The recipe uses cherry preserves for the filling.  It makes enough dough for the torte and extra cookies.  To make cookies, roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut out decorative shapes and bake at 350 degrees on a parchment-lined sheet until golden, about 10 minutes.

Arrange 6 more strips across torte in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Seal ends of strips to dough edge, trimming excess.  Reserve all dough scraps to make cookies, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake torte until crust is golden brown and preserves are bubbling thickly, about 40 minutes.  Cool torte completely on rack.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with foil; store at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Push bottom of pan up to free torte from pan.  Sift powdered sugar over edge of torte, if desired, and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This jam-filled pastry with a cookie-like dough takes its name from the town of Linz.  The recipe uses cherry preserves for the filling.  It makes enough dough for the torte and extra cookies.  To make cookies, roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut out decorative shapes and bake at 350 degrees on a parchment-lined sheet until golden, about 10 minutes.

                       Chicken Mole With Chipotles

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     skinless boneless chicken thighs -- each cut 3 pieces
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  2               cans  chili-style chunky tomatoes in juice -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  minced canned chipotle chilies -- plus
  1         tablespoon  adobo sauce from chilies
  1              ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped

Coat chicken on all sides with cumin.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add chicken; sautÃˆ until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.

Add onion and sautÃˆ until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add tomatoes with juice, broth, chipotle chilies, adobo sauce, and chocolate and bring to simmer.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through and sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Mole, a classic Mexican chili sauce, gets streamlined here.  Chipotle chilies (available canned at Latin American markets and many supermarkets) add heat, while unsweetened chocolate provides subtle sweetness.  Serve the stew in shallow bowls with steamed rice.  Add an arugula, orange, and red onion salad and a basket of warm corn tortillas.  For dessert, offer cinnamon-spiked hot chocolate and wafer cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  whole milk
  4              large  egg yolks
  5             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === CREAM PUFFS ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  4              large  eggs
                        === GLAZE ===
  10            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

For Pastry Cream:  Whisk sugar and flour in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Gradually whisk in milk, then egg yolks.  Whisking constantly, cook over medium heat until cream thickens and boils, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Press plastic wrap onto surface.  Chill pastry cream until cold and firm, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.

For Cream Puffs:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil, whisking until sugar dissolves and butter melts.  Remove from heat.  Add flour and cocoa all at once; whisk until smooth and blended (dough will form ball).  Stir over low heat until dough leaves film on pan bottom, about 2 minutes.  Transfer dough to large bowl; cool to lukewarm, about 8 minutes.  Using electric mixer, beat in eggs 1 at a time.

Drop batter by teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets in at least 64 scant 1-inch mounds.  Using moistened fingertips, smooth any pointed tips on mounds.  Bake puffs 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Continue to bake until puffs are firm and beginning to crack and dry on top, about 23 minutes longer.  Transfer puffs to rack.  Using small knife or chopstick, poke hole in side of each puff near bottom to allow steam to escape.  Cool puffs completely.

Spoon pastry cream into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain round tip.  Pipe into each puff through hole in side.

For Glaze:  Place 10 ounces chocolate in small microwave-safe dish.  Microwave on high for 15-second intervals until beginning to melt; stir glaze until completely melted and smooth.

Dip bottom of 4 filled cream puffs into glaze.  Arrange puffs, spaced about 1/4 inch apart, in square on plate.  Dip bottom of 3 more puffs into glaze.  Arrange in triangle atop first 4 puffs, pressing slightly so glaze holds puffs in place.  Dip bottom of 1 more puff into glaze; place on top.  Drizzle mound of puffs with some of glaze.  Repeat with remaining cream puffs, forming 8 desserts.  Refrigerate until glaze sets and holds puffs together, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  French for "crunch in mouth," a classic croquembouche is made with custard-filled cream puffs coated with caramel and stacked in a tall pyramid shape.  Here, these chocolate-cream-filled puff pyramids are scaled down to individual servings and drizzled with a chocolate glaze.

                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  38                    candied violets -- (optional)
                        = (available at specialty foods store)
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1                     twelve-inch styrofoam cone
                        = (available at most floral and
                        party supply stores)
                        Rose leaves and miniature white roses or
                        other small flowers

Bring cream and butter to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium; stir until butter melts.  Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in sour cream, liqueur and orange peel.   Pour into 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Refrigerate mixture until firm enough to hold shape, about 1 hour.

Line 4 large cookie sheets with foil; sift powdered sugar over 2 sheets and cocoa powder over 2 sheets.  Using 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop (1 1/2 tablespoons), scoop truffle mixture, mounding slightly, and release onto sugar-dusted sheet.

Submerge 1 large sugar-dusted truffle in white chocolate, tilting pan if necessary.  Using long fork, lift truffle from chocolate.  Tap fork gently against side of pan (if necessary) to remove excess chocolate.  Using knife as aid, slide truffle off fork and onto clean foil-lined cookie sheet.  Wipe fork clean.  Repeat process with all remaining sugar-dusted truffles.  Freeze for 15 minutes.

Reheat remaining white chocolate to 115 degrees.  over simmering water.  Repeat dipping process to give truffles a double coating of white chocolate.

Melt bittersweet chocolate in top of clean double boiler over simmering water, stirring until candy thermometer registers 115 degrees.  Dip spoon into bittersweet chocolate and wave quickly white chocolate-coated truffles, creating zigzag lines.  Refrigerate truffles.

Line 2 more cookie sheets with foil.  Using dipping process described above, dip cocoa-dusted truffles into bittersweet chocolate, dipping each truffle only once.  Immediately top each with candied violet.  Refrigerate truffles 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 3 weeks ahead.  Cover and chill truffles and remaining melted bittersweet chocolate separately.)

Assemble:  Remelt remaining bittersweet chocolate.  Brush melted bittersweet chocolate in 2-inch-wide strip down length of cone.  Wrap waxed paper around cone, covering completely and pressing against chocolate to adhere.

Place cone on platter.  Holding toothpick at sharp angle, press 2/3 of toothpick into cone near base.  Press 1 large truffle onto toothpick.  Repeat with more toothpicks and remaining large truffles, alternating dark and white truffles and attaching in spiral design toward top of cone.

Begin attaching small truffles 4 inches from top of cone and continue to cover completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)  Press rose leaves between truffles on cone, covering any spaces.  Press toothpicks into roses and attach to leaves between truffles.

This recipe yields 76 truffles.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  Lyle's Golden Syrup
                        = (or light corn syrup)
  3        tablespoons  frozen concentrated cranberry
                        juice cocktail -- thawed
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries
     1/2           cup  pecans -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        Powdered sugar -- (optional)
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder -- (optional)

Stir cream, butter, syrup, and cranberry concentrate in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture comes to boil.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted.  Mix in cranberries and pecans.  Pour truffle mixture into 11- by 7-inch glass dish.  Freeze until firm, about 50 minutes.

Cut truffle mixture into 36 portions.  Lift each out and roll between palms into round.  Place on baking sheet.  Roll truffles in powdered sugar or cocoa powder.  Cover and chill up to 1 week.  Serve cold.

This recipe yields 36 truffles.

Comments:  "The recipe here reflects my British roots, but not necessarily my family traditions," writes Mairi Morrison of London, England.  "Although my mother is from Scotland and my father is from Northern Ireland, I grew up in Los Angeles, where our weeknight meals were typically American: spaghetti, tacos, and burgers.  It wasn't until I moved to Europe that I became really interested in food.  Here in London my social life is centered around the table.  I really like this dish because it is typically British, and perfect for a rainy winter evening in London."

Make these ahead if you like (they will keep for a week in the fridge) or make them on a whim, since the recipe is so easy.  Lyle's Golden Syrup is a popular British sweetener with a flavor that's similar to mild honey.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIES ===
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg yolk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === GARNISH ===
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  1 1/4           cups  slivered almonds (abt 5 oz) -- toasted, chopped

For Cookies:  Place slivered almonds in processor and add 1/4 cup sugar.  Grind almonds finely.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in egg yolk, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Add ground-nut mixture and flour and beat until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into 2 balls; flatten each ball into disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out half of dough between sheets of waxed paper or parchment paper to scant 1/4-inch thickness, sprinkling dough lightly with flour as needed to keep from sticking and occasionally peeling off top paper to remove wrinkles.  Peel off top sheet.

Using 2 1/2- by 1 1/2-inch oval cookie cutter (or cardboard template), cut out cookies.  If dough is soft, slide rimless baking sheet under paper and chill 10 minutes to firm.  Transfer cookies to prepared sheets, spacing 1/2 inch apart.  Gather scraps and reroll dough, cutting out more cookies.  Chill cookies on sheets 15 minutes before baking.

Position racks in top third and bottom third of oven; preheat to 325 degrees.  Bake cookies 5 minutes.  Reverse sheets and bake until cookies begin to color, about 6 minutes.  Cool cookies on sheets 5 minutes.  Transfer to racks; cool completely.  Repeat with remaining dough.

For Filling:  Bring cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Remove from heat; add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Let cool until thick but still spreadable, about 2 hours.

Place half of cookies, bottom-side up, on work surface.  Spoon ganache filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain tip.  Leaving 1/4-inch plain border, pipe (or spread) ganache on cookies.  Top each with second cookie, bottom-side down, pressing to adhere.

For Garnish:  Stir chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water until smooth.  Place almonds in small bowl.  Dip end of 1 cookie in chocolate, then in almonds.  Transfer to sheet of foil.  Repeat with remaining cookies.  Let stand until garnish is set.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight in refrigerator in single layers between sheets of waxed paper.

This recipe yields about 28 cookies.

Comments:  Swiss butter cookies with rich ganache filling.

     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

* Note:  Brown star-shaped seed pods available at Asian markets and specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and process, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add egg yolks and process, using on/off turns, until dough comes together in large moist clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Cover with plastic; chill 20 minutes.

Spray 10-inch-diameter springform pan with nonstick spray.  Divide dough into 2 equal pieces.  Roll out 1 dough piece on generously floured surface to 10 1/2-inch round.  Roll dough up on rolling pin and transfer to pan.  Press dough round into bottom of pan, patching any cracks.

Divide second dough piece into 4 equal pieces.  Roll out each piece between palms and generously floured surface to 7-inch rope.  Place dough ropes end to end to form 1 continuous ring along bottom edge of pan.  Press dough ring firmly up sides of pan, forming 1 3/4-inch-high sides.  Press dough seams together to seal.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake crust just until set and very light golden around edges, about 10 minutes.  Cool.

For Apples:  Position 1 rack in bottom third of oven and 1 rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Spray 2 heavy large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray.

Toss apples with butter and lemon juice in very large bowl.  Arrange in single layer on sheets, leaving spaces between apples.  Sprinkle 3 tablespoons sugar over apples on each sheet.  Bake until apples are tender and golden brown, turning apples occasionally and rotating pans between lower and higher racks, about 40 minutes.  Cool.  (Crust and apples can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover crust and store at room temperature.  Place apples in bowl.  Cover; refrigerate.)

Place pan with crust on clean baking sheet.  Arrange apple wedges close together, standing on short ends, in concentric circles in crust.

For Spiced Brown Butter:  Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into butter; add bean.  Add cloves, star anise and cinnamon stick.  Cook over low heat until butter turns golden brown and spices flavor butter, adjusting heat if necessary to prevent burning and stirring frequently, about 25 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Whisk eggs, sugar, flour, and salt to blend in medium bowl.  Strain spiced brown butter mixture into egg mixture; whisk to blend.  Reserve vanilla bean, star anise, and cinnamon stick; discard cloves.

Slowly pour egg mixture over apples in crust.  Bake until egg mixture is set, puffed and light golden and apples are deep golden brown, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Cool on rack at least 30 minutes.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Release pan sides.  Transfer tart to platter.  Garnish tart with reserved vanilla bean, star anise, and cinnamon stick, if desired.  Serve tart slightly warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This large rustic tart has hints of anise, cinnamon and clove, spices that are also found in the noted honey cake of Burgundy, pain d'Ãˆpice.  The apples can be roasted one day ahead so that the tart can be baked early in the day on Christmas Eve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  apple cider
  6        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  3                     Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
  2               cups  cranberries - (fresh or frozen)
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar - (about)

Whisk apple cider, corn syrup, and brown sugar in heavy large saucepan.  Boil over high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes.  Add 4 tablespoons butter; whisk until melted.  Remove from heat.

Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add apple pieces; sautÃˆ 2 minutes.  Add cranberries and 1/2 cup sugar.  Stir until cranberries begin to pop, about 2 minutes.  Stir in reduced cider mixture.  Boil until reduced to syrup consistency, about 6 minutes.  Stir in more sugar, if desired.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Stir over medium heat until heated through.)  Transfer compote to bowl and serve warm.

This recipe yields about 6 cups.

Comments:  This colorful and festive compote is also nice on waffles and pancakes -- or even spooned over vanilla ice cream.  This recipe is an accompaniment for "Eggnog French Toast with Cranberry-Apple Compote" (see recipe).

                        the Asian section of some supermarkets)
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed

Mix first 9 ingredients and 1 1/2 cups panko in large bowl to blend.  Cover mixture and refrigerate 1 hour.

Place remaining 2 cups panko on large plate.  Form scallop mixture into balls, using 1 heaping tablespoon for each.  Coat in panko, flattening slightly.

Heat enough vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat to come 1/4 inch up sides of pan.  Working in batches, sautÃˆ scallop cakes until golden and cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer scallop cakes to paper towels to drain.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cool, then cover and refrigerate.  Reheat on baking sheet in 350 degrees oven 8 minutes.)  Transfer scallop cakes to platter.

This recipe yields about 40 cakes.

Comments:  Creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, these are fragrant with Indian curry and cilantro.  Scallops are a less expensive alternative to crab, and they make a moist, plump little cake.  Prepare the scallop cakes ahead and simply reheat right before guests arrive.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                     box chocolate wafer cookies - (9 oz) -- broken
  3             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, hot
                        === FILLING ===
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  2             pounds  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder -- sifted
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  peppermint extract
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  12                    fresh mint leaves

For Crust:  Finely grind cookies, chocolate and sugar in processor.  Add butter; blend until crumbs begin to stick together.  Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.

For Filling:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Cool to lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until blended.  Add eggs 1 at time, beating just until incorporated.  Add melted chocolate, cream, cocoa powder and extracts and beat just until smooth.

Pour filling into crust.  Bake until center is just set, about 1 hour.  Transfer to rack and cool 20 minutes.  Press down gently on puffed edges to flatten.  Run small sharp knife around top edge of pan to loosen.  Do not remove pan sides.  Cool.  Cover and chill overnight.

For Toppings:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine sour cream and sugar in bowl.  Spoon sour cream topping over cheesecake.  Bake 20 minutes.  Chill cheesecake until cold, at least 6 hours.

Bring cream and butter to simmer in heavy small saucepan.  Reduce heat to low.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted.  Freeze until firm enough to pipe, whisking occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Remove pan sides from cake.  Spoon chocolate topping into pastry bag fitted with small star tip.  Pipe 6 diagonal lines atop cake, spacing evenly.  Repeat in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Pipe 12 rosettes of chocolate around top edge of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)  Garnish with mint leaves.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  purchased eggnog
  4              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                     country white bread loaf - (14.5 oz) -- halved horizontally,
                        half cut crosswise 8 slices -- (do not use ends)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        Powdered sugar
                        Cranberry-Apple Compote -- (see recipe)

Whisk first 4 ingredients in large bowl.  Place bread slices in single layer in two 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dishes.  Pour custard over bread, dividing equally.  Cover dishes and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Butter 2 large rimmed baking sheets with some melted butter.

Using spatula, transfer bread slices to prepared baking sheets.  Brush bread with remaining melted butter.  Bake 10 minutes.  Turn over bread slices and bake until golden brown and crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, about 6 minutes longer.

Place 2 French toast slices on each of 8 plates.  Dust generously with powdered sugar; serve with Cranberry-Apple Compote.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is perfect for Christmas Day breakfast since it can be completely assembled the night before and then baked in one batch in the oven.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ICE CREAM ===
  3               cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  6              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  dark rum
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  whipping cream

For Sauce:  Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add brown sugar, cream and corn syrup and stir until sugar dissolves.  Boil 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Mix in rum.  Cool slightly.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before using.)

Comments:  At â€œran MÃ›r, the ice cream comes in profiteroles surrounded by the sauce, but this lovely duo tastes terrific without that added touch, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE PUDDING ===
  10             large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  4               cups  half-and-half
  1              pound  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
                        === POACHED APRICOTS ===
     2/3           cup  water -- plus
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/3           cup  honey
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  9             ounces  dried apricots
                        === DARK CHOCOLATE CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  5        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  1 1/2                 purchased pound cakes - (12 oz ea) -- more or less
  6        tablespoons  dark rum
  3        tablespoons  white creme de cacao liqueur
  4                     baskets fresh raspberries - 1/2 pint ea)
                        = (or 16 oz thawed frozen
                        unsweetened raspberries)
                        Firmly-whipped cream -- as needed

For Pudding:  Whisk yolks, sugar and cornstarch in medium bowl.  Bring half-and-half to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Gradually whisk hot half-and-half into yolk mixture.  Return mixture to same saucepan and whisk over medium heat until custard boils.  Boil 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Remove from heat.  Pour pudding into large bowl.  Add white chocolate and butter and whisk until smooth.  Chill until thick and cold, whisking occasionally, about 3 hours.

For Apricots:  Line cookie sheet with foil.  Brush foil lightly with vegetable oil.

Combine 2/3 cup water, honey, sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over high heat until sugar dissolves.  Add apricots and bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer 10 minutes.

Transfer 5 apricots and 1/4 cup poaching syrup to heavy small skillet.  Combine remaining apricots with remaining poaching syrup, 3 tablespoons water and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in processor and puree.  Pour puree into bowl.

Cook apricots in skillet over high heat until syrup is reduced to glaze, turning apricots once, about 4 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer candied apricots to foil.  Cool.  Mix any syrup from skillet into puree.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover candied apricots and puree separately and let stand at room temperature.)

For Dark Chocolate Cream:  Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to low.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted.  Chill until cold but still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Cut cakes into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Cut each slice into 4 squares.  Arrange enough cake in 4-quart glass trifle dish to cover bottom, fitting tightly.  Mix rum and liqueur in bowl.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons over cake.  Drop 1/3 of apricot puree by spoonfuls over cake.  Gently spread with back of spoon, allowing puree to show at sides of bowl.

Reserve 1/4 basket berries for garnish.  Sprinkle 1/3 of remaining berries over puree, arranging some berries to show at sides of bowl.  Starting 1 inch in from sides of bowl, pour 1/3 of dark chocolate cream over, making sure it does not touch sides of bowl.  Starting at edge, pour 2 cups white chocolate pudding over chocolate cream.

Repeat layering with remaining cake, rum mixture, apricot puree, berries, dark chocolate cream and white chocolate pudding in 2 more layers each.  Smooth top.  Cover and chill overnight.

Spoon whipped cream into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip.  Pipe around edge of trifle.  Top with candied apricots and reserved berries.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead; chill.)  Serve cold.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  A trifle with a few twists: a white chocolate pudding and layers of dark chocolate cream and apricot puree.

  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee powder
  1              large  egg white -- plus
  1         tablespoon  egg white
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === DARK CHOCOLATE FILLING ===
  5        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  1         tablespoon  instant coffee powder
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE FILLING ===
  4 1/2    tablespoons  whipping cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light corn syrup
  1         tablespoon  instant coffee powder
  12            ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1              whole  toasted almonds

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom with foil, carefully pressing up sides and into grooves.  Brush foil with vegetable oil.

Finely grind first 4 ingredients in processor.  Add egg white and vanilla and blend until mixture almost forms balls.  Press onto bottom (not up sides) of prepared pan, using wet finger-tips as aid.  Bake until crust looks dry and feels firm, about 14 minutes.  Cool.

For Dark Chocolate Filling:  Bring first 4 ingredients to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring ocassionally.  Add chocolate and whisk until smooth.  Set aside.

For White Chocolate Filling:  Bring first 3 ingredients to simmer in heavy large saucepan.  Reduce heat to low.  Add white chocolate and whisk until smooth.  Remove from heat and whisk in sour cream.  Pour 1/2 cup of mixture into small bowl; add butter to mixture in small bowl and whisk until smooth.  Set aside for garnish.

Drop dark chocolate filling and remaining white chocolate filling alternately by 1/4 cupfuls onto crust.  Swirl fillings together using tip of knife.  Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.

Freeze reserved 1/2 cup white chocolate filling until firm enough to pipe, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Lift tart from pan using foil sides as aid.  Peel down foil sides.  Turn tart on side and carefully peel foil off bottom of tart.  Place tart on platter.

Spoon reserved white chocolate filling into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip.  Pipe white chocolate mixture around edge of tart.  Garnish with almonds.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead; refrigerate.  Cover when firm and keep refrigerated.)  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  With a crust fashioned after the popular cookie, this tart features a dark and white chocolate mocha filling.  It's really more like candy and should be cut into small wedges.

                Fresh Orange-Cranberry Sauce With Walnuts

Recipe By     :Edi Meadows Morrissette, Westin, FL
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag cranberries - (12 oz)
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1             medium  seedless orange -- all peel and pith
                        cut away, fruit diced
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted, cut into
                        1/2-inch pieces

Combine first 4 ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Cook until cranberries are tender and mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Mix in orange pieces and walnuts.  Transfer to bowl.  Cover and chill until cold, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.

This recipe yields about 4 cups.

Comments:  "My profession as a real estate agent requires a lot of my time," writes Edi Meadows Morrissette of Westin, Florida, "so it helps that I am lightning-fast in the kitchen.  I cook every day, and on the weekends I sometimes make three meals a day.  I accomplish that by following my main cooking principles: (1) do a lot of prep work, and (2) keep the kitchen well stocked.  For example, at holiday time I might chop onions in advance or bake bread the day before company arrives.  And since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage, I know I'll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."

The addition of fresh orange pieces is a lovely variation on the holiday condiment.  Begin two hours or up to three days ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HONEY SYRUP ===
  2              large  oranges - (to 3)
     1/2           cup  honey
     2/3           cup  orange juice
                        === CAKE ===
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     3/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     2/3           cup  half-and-half
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     2/3           cup  dried currants
                        === FROSTING ===
  12            ounces  imported white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  3               cups  toasted sliced almonds
                        Orange slices or orange peel ribbon

For Syrup:  Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from oranges in strips.  Mince enough peel to measure 4 tablespoons.  Mix honey, orange juice and 2 tablespoons orange peel (reserve remaining 2 tablespoons peel for cake) in heavy medium saucepan.  Boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes.  Set honey syrup aside.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch square baking pan with 2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom with waxed paper.  Butter paper.  Dust pan with flour.

Using electric mixer, beat first 8 ingredients in large bowl until fluffy.  Mix in reserved 2 tablespoons minced orange peel.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift flour, baking soda and baking powder into medium bowl.  Mix half-and-half and lemon juice in small bowl.  Beat dry ingredients alternately with half-and-half mixture into butter mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.  Mix in currants.

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  (Cake will not rise to top of pan.)  Cool cake 20 minutes.  Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen.  Turn cake out onto rack; cool.  Peel off paper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover syrup and cake separately and let stand at room temperature.)

For Frosting:  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.  Cool to barely luke warm.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and cream cheese until light.  Add chocolate and 1/4 cup honey syrup and beat until smooth and light.  Chill until thick enough to spread, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Cut cake horizontally in half.  Place bottom layer cut-side up on platter.  Brush with 1/4 cup honey syrup.  Spread 1 1/4 cups frosting over.  Brush remaining 1/4 cup syrup over cut side of top cake layer.  Place cake cut-side down atop filled layer.  Set aside 2/3 cup frosting for garnish.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Press almonds around sides.  Spoon remaining 2/3 cup frosting into pastry bag fitted with small star tip.  Pipe frosting decoratively around top edge of cake.

Chill cake until frosting sets, about 1 hour.  Garnish with orange slices.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Let stand 2 hours at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This moist Christmas cake takes its cues from the flavors and spices found in the classic Lebkuchen cookie.  It's brushed with an orange-scented honey syrup, frosted with a creamy white chocolate icing and then surrounded by sliced almonds.

  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar -- (packed)
     1/4           cup  robust-flavored (dark) molasses
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === ICING ===
                        Icing
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar -- or more if needed
  5          teaspoons  water
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

For Cookies:  Sift first 7 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Add sugar and beat until well blended.  Beat in molasses, egg yolk, orange peel, and vanilla.  Add flour mixture and beat just until blended.  Gather dough into ball.  Divide into 4 pieces.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap each in plastic and chill until cold and firm, at least 4 hours.

Position racks in top third and bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out 1 piece of dough on lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 2 1/2- to 3-inch star-shaped cutter, cut out cookies.  Transfer cookies to prepared sheets, spacing 1/2 inch apart (cookies spread very little).  Gather scraps and reroll dough, cutting out more cookies.

Bake cookies 5 minutes.  Reverse baking sheets; bake until cookies are puffed and look slightly darker around edges, about 5 minutes longer.  Cool cookies on sheets 2 minutes.  Using thin metal spatula, transfer cookies to racks; cool.  Repeat with remaining dough pieces.

For Icing:  Sift 1 1/2 cups sugar into medium bowl.  Add 5 teaspoons water and vanilla; whisk until smooth.  Whisk in more sugar by tablespoonfuls, if necessary, until icing falls thickly off whisk.  Spoon icing into pastry bag fitted with 1/16-inch plain round tip or resealable plastic bag (cut tip off bag).  Pipe icing onto cookies.  Let stand until icing is hard, at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight between sheets of waxed paper.)

This recipe yields about 3 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Powdered-sugar icing decorates these crisp gingerbread-like treats.

           Gingerbread Christmas Pudding With Orange Hard Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Christmas                       Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HARD SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
                        === PUDDING ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  2 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  ground ginger
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     3/4           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
     1/4           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel

For Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in small bowl; stir to blend well.  (Can be made 4 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

For Pudding:  Coat inside and center tube of 6- to 8-cup pudding mold or Bundt cake pan with nonstick spray, then generously with butter.  Sift flour and next 6 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, then marmalade, molasses and orange peel.  Add flour mixture and beat just until blended.  Transfer batter to prepared mold.  Cover mold tightly with foil.

Place steamer rack in large pot.  Place pudding mold on rack.  Fill pot with enough water to come halfway up sides of mold.  Bring water to boil.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cover pot and steam pudding until tester inserted near center comes out clean, adding more boiling water as needed to maintain level, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

Using oven mitts as aid, remove mold from pot.  Uncover and let stand 10 minutes.  Cut around top center and sides of pudding to loosen.  Turn pudding out onto rack and cool 20 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Return to mold; cover and chill.  Resteam 45 minutes to heat through, then turn out of mold.)  Transfer pudding to platter.  Cut pudding into wedges; serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  English Christmas "pudding" is really a dense, moist spiced cake.  This gingerbread version is flavored with orange marmalade and topped with a traditional hard sauce -- butter and sugar mixed with brandy.

            Greek-Herbed Spinach Latkes With Feta-Yogurt Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter -- or more if needed
  1                cup  chopped green onions
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  2           packages  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed, drained,
                        and squeezed dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  crustless challah pieces - (packed)
                        = ( or other egg-bread pieces)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh dill
  4              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more if needed
                        Feta-Yogurt Sauce -- (see recipe)

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add green onions and garlic; sautÃˆ until onions are soft, about 2 minutes.  Add spinach and sautÃˆ until liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cool completely.

Blend challah in processor to fine crumbs.  Add spinach mixture and dill and process, using on/off turns, until spinach is finely chopped.  Transfer to large bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Mix in eggs and baking powder.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into skillet, using back of spoon to flatten latkes slightly.  Cook until brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to paper towels to drain.  Add more butter and oil to skillet as necessary and allow to get hot before adding more batter.

Transfer latkes to plates.  Serve, passing Feta-Yogurt Sauce separately.

This recipe yields about 30 latkes.

Comments:  A tangy feta and yogurt sauce is the perfect foil for these fresh-tasting latkes.  They make a nice starter for a party of ten.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add green onions and garlic; sautÃˆ until onions are soft, about 2 minutes.  Add spinach and sautÃˆ until liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Blend challah in processor to fine crumbs.  Add spinach mixture and dill and process, using on/off turns, until spinach is finely chopped.  Transfer to large bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Mix in eggs and baking powder.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into skillet, using back of spoon to flatten latkes slightly.  Cook until brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to paper towels to drain.  Add more butter and oil to skillet as necessary and allow to get hot before adding more batter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer latkes to plates.  Serve, passing Feta-Yogurt Sauce separately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 30 latkes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A tangy feta and yogurt sauce is the perfect foil for these fresh-tasting latkes.  They make a nice starter for a party of ten.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
     2/3           cup  sugar
  14       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 3/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
                        Apricot jam
                        Powdered sugar

Combine hazelnuts and 1 tablespoon sugar in processor; grind nuts finely.  Using electric mixer, beat remaining 2/3 cup sugar and butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in hazelnut mixture, then egg, egg yolk, lemon peel, lemon extract, salt, and cinnamon.  Beat in flour.  Gather dough into ball.  Divide into 4 pieces.  Flatten each into disk and wrap in plastic.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out 1 dough piece between sheets of waxed paper or parchment to scant 1/4-inch thickness, sprinkling dough with flour to prevent sticking and occasionally peeling off top paper to remove wrinkles.  Peel off top sheet.  Using 2-inch-diameter fluted cutter, cut out cookies.  Transfer to prepared sheets, spacing 1/2 inch apart.

Gather dough scraps and reroll, cutting out more cookies and placing on sheets.  Using 1-inch-diameter fluted cutter, cut out centers from half of cookies, making rings.  Gather centers as scraps.  Bake cookies 5 minutes.  Reverse sheets; bake cookies until light golden, about 6 minutes longer.  Cool cookies on sheets 2 minutes.  Transfer to racks; cool completely.  Repeat with remaining dough.

Arrange whole cookie rounds on work surface.  Drop generous 1/2 teaspoon jam in center of each.  Arrange cookie rings on work surface.  Sift powdered sugar over.  Place 1 ring cookie on each whole round, forming sandwich with jam in cutout center.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store airtight between sheets of waxed paper in refrigerator up to 3 days.)

This recipe yields about 4 dozen.

Comments;  Inspired by the famous Austrian Linzertorte.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  6        tablespoons  reserved pan drippings -- see * Note
                        = (or 6 tablespoons olive oil)

* Note:  From "Roast Prime Rib With Madeira Sauce And Horseradish Sauce" (see recipe).

Whisk eggs in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Sift flour and salt into egg mixture; whisk until well blended and smooth.  Whisk in all herbs.  Let batter stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes or refrigerate up to 3 hours.  Rewhisk before using.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place 16 standard (1/3 cup) metal muffin cups in oven to preheat 10 minutes.  Place 1 teaspoon drippings from rib roast in each muffin cup.  Return pan to oven until drippings are very hot, about 8 minutes.

Immediately spoon 2 generous tablespoonfuls batter atop hot drippings in each muffin cup.  Bake until puddings are golden and puffy, about 12 minutes (puddings will sink in center but edges will stay puffy).  Serve hot.

This recipe yields about 16 puddings.

Whisk eggs in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Sift flour and salt into egg mixture; whisk until well blended and smooth.  Whisk in all herbs.  Let batter stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes or refrigerate up to 3 hours.  Rewhisk before using.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place 16 standard (1/3 cup) metal muffin cups in oven to preheat 10 minutes.  Place 1 teaspoon drippings from rib roast in each muffin cup.  Return pan to oven until drippings are very hot, about 8 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Immediately spoon 2 generous tablespoonfuls batter atop hot drippings in each muffin cup.  Bake until puddings are golden and puffy, about 12 minutes (puddings will sink in center but edges will stay puffy).  Serve hot.

This recipe yields about 16 puddings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes                        Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
                        = (available at Italian markets, specialty
                        foods stores and many supermarkets)
     3/4           cup  hot water
  7        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more if needed
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  Hungarian hot paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  2        tablespoons  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (preferably made from egg bread)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place porcini in small bowl.  Add 3/4 cup hot water and let stand 45 minutes.  Strain through fine sieve, reserving soaking liquid.  Coarsely chop porcini.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chopped porcini and garlic; sautÃˆ 2 minutes.  Add reserved porcini soaking liquid and paprika; cook until liquid evaporates, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cool.  (Mushroom mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Finely grate potatoes by hand or in processor fitted with grating disk.  Transfer potatoes to large bowl.  Add enough cold water to cover; let stand 5 minutes.  Drain potatoes.  Wrap in dry kitchen towel; twist ends to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.  Place potatoes in large bowl.  Mix in egg, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper.  Stir in mushroom mixture.

Heat 6 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches, drop potato mixture by 1/4 cupfuls into hot oil, spacing apart.  Using spatula, flatten each into 4-inch round and cook until crisp and brown, about 4 minutes per side.  Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to paper towels to drain.  Add more oil to skillet as necessary and allow oil to get hot before adding more potato mixture.  Transfer to plates and serve.

This recipe yields about 10 latkes.

Comments:  Traditional potato latkes are spiced up with hot paprika and enhanced with earthy porcini mushrooms.  They are especially good with roasted meats, poultry, or fish.  This recipe will serve four to five as a side dish.

  1                cup  very finely-chopped toasted hazelnuts -- (abt 4 oz)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === GLAZE ===
  9             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  light corn syrup
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cups  half-and-half
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  6                     egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
     1/4           cup  Frangelico
  3             ounces  imported milk chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  12                    husked toasted hazelnuts

For Filling:  Line 5 1/2- to 6-cup metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, overlapping sides.

Melt chocolate and butter with corn syrup in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until smooth.  Cool to lukewarm, whisking occasionally.

Whisk 1/4 cup cream, 4 tablespoons Frangelico, yolks, sugar and 2 tablespoons water in small metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water and whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 3 minutes.  Remove from over water.  Add yolk mixture and remaining 2 tablespoons Frangelico to chocolate mixture in pan; whisk until smooth.  Mix in nuts.  Chill until cool, about 10 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat remaining 1/4 cup cream with sour cream in large bowl to stiff peaks.  Add chocolate mixture and fold together.  Pour filling into prepared pan; smooth top.  Cover and chill overnight.

For Glaze:  Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over low heat until melted.  Cool to lukewarm.  Pour 1/2 cup glaze over filling in pan; shake pan gently to smooth top.  Freeze until glaze sets, about 20 minutes.

Line cookie sheet with foil.  Lift loaf from pan.  Turn loaf out onto foil; peel off plastic.  Whisk remaining glaze over low heat until just spreadable.  Pour all but 1/4 cup glaze over loaf.  Spread over top and sides with icing spatula, spreading glaze that runs onto foil up sides of loaf to cover completely.  Chill 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill loaf and reserved 1/4 cup glaze separately.)

For Sauce:  Bring half-and-half to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Whisk yolks and sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk in hot half-and-half mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 5 minutes; do not boil.  Strain into bowl.  Mix in cream and Frangelico.  Cover and chill until cold.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

Melt milk chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Spoon all but 2 tablespoons melted chocolate into parchment cone.  Remove loaf from foil and transfer to platter.  Pipe chocolate lines crosswise atop loaf, spacing 1/8 inch apart.

Dip 1 hazelnut halfway into chocolate in pan; place atop center of loaf.  Repeat with remaining nuts, spacing evenly and forming line down center.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; refrigerate.)

Using long thin knife, cut loaf into 1/2-inch-thick slices, wiping knife clean between cuts.  Place slices on plate; surround with sauce.  Whisk reserved glaze over low heat until melted.  Spoon into parchment cone.  Pipe Zs atop sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  Italian parsley leaves - (lightly packed)
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 3/4 tspns dried thyme, crumbled
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried rosemary, crumbled
  1             medium  garlic clove
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  linguine pasta
     1/3           cup  chopped toasted pine nuts

Combine first 6 ingredients in processor and blend to coarse puree.  Blend in cheese using on/off turns.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Transfer pesto to jar.  Pour enough additional oil over pesto to cover completely.  Cover and refrigerate.  Pour off extra oil before using.)

Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well.  Return to same pot.  Add pesto sauce and toss to coat pasta evenly.  Transfer to large platter.  Garnish with chopped pine nuts.

This recipe yields 2 generous servings.

Comments:  This parsley-based pesto is a nice alternative to the classic basil one -- and it's especially handy for December, when there might not be fresh basil at the market.  The recipe yields about 1 1/3 cups of sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  garbanzo beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
                        = (chickpeas)
  2                     garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary
  3              large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more if needed
                        Pomegranate seeds -- (optional)

Blend garbanzo beans, garlic, and rosemary in processor to coarse paste.  Add eggs, 6 tablespoons water and extra-virgin olive oil; blend until smooth.  Add flour, cumin, salt, pepper, and baking powder and blend.  Pour batter into bowl.

Heat 6 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into hot oil.  Cook until golden, about 1 minute per side.  Using slotted spatula, transfer latkes to paper towels to drain.  Add more oil to skillet as necessary and allow to get hot before adding more batter.

Transfer latkes to plates.  Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields about 24 latkes.

Comments:  Chickpea fritters laced with rosemary are common in parts of France and Italy.  For a terrific side dish that serves eight, top these latkes with a quick sauce made by stirring two tablespoons dried mint into one cup plain yogurt, and offer with fish.  Or drizzle the latkes with pomegranate molasses (found at Middle Eastern markets and some supermarkets), and serve with meat or poultry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING AND TOPPING ===
  4               cups  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  20            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped fine, plus
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped separately
     1/3           cup  dark rum
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === SYRUP ===
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  instant coffee powder
     2/3           cup  cake flour
  3        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  3              large  eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

For Filling and Topping:  Stir first 3 ingredients in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and cream comes to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Add 20 ounces chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.  Whisk in rum and vanilla.  Transfer 1 cup warm chocolate mixture to small bowl; whisk remaining 2 ounces chocolate into mixture in bowl and set aside for topping.  Cover; let stand at room temperature.  Transfer remaining chocolate mixture to large bowl to use as filling; chill until cold and thick, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.

For Syrup:  Stir water and sugar in small saucepan over low heat just until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat; mix in rum.  Cover and let stand up to 1 day.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Line bottom with waxed paper; butter paper.

Combine vanilla and coffee powder in cup; swirl to dissolve coffee.  Sift flour, cocoa, and baking soda into small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in medium bowl until very thick and light in color, about 3 minutes.  Beat in vanilla-coffee mixture.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold 1/3 of whites into yolk mixture.  Fold in half of flour mixture.  Fold in half of remaining whites, then remaining flour mixture, then remaining whites.

Transfer batter to prepared pan; gently spread to even thickness.  Bake cake until puffed and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 18 minutes.  Cool in pan on rack (cake may shrink slightly).

Cut around pan to loosen cake.  Turn out onto work surface; peel off paper.  Using long serrated knife, cut cake horizontally in half.  Place 1 half, cut-side up, on platter.  Drizzle half of syrup (about 3 1/2 tablespoons) over.

Using electric mixer, beat cold chocolate filling until thick and lighter in color, less than 1 minute.  Spread all of filling evenly over cake layer, aligning with sides of cake (filling will be about 1 inch thick).  Drizzle remaining syrup over cut side of second cake layer.  Place layer, syrup-side down, atop filling; press to adhere.

Rewarm topping over low heat just until pourable.  Pour topping onto top center of cake.  Using small spatula, spread topping to edges, being careful to keep it from spilling over.  Chill cake up to 1 day, covering loosely with foil or with cake dome after 2 hours.   Cut cake into 16 squares and serve.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  This ultra-rich dessert is inspired by the classic RigÃ› Jancsi cake, named for the legendary Hungarian Gypsy violinist.  Make it one day ahead to allow the flavors to meld.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process)
     3/4      teaspoon  instant espresso powder
                        = (or instant coffee powder)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  3             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        == (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  3             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

Position racks in top third and bottom third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Sift first 5 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in powdered sugar.  Add dry ingredients and beat until well blended.

Gather dough into ball; divide into 3 equal pieces.  Place 1 dough piece close to each end of 1 prepared sheet.  Place third piece in center of second prepared sheet.  Using moistened fingertips, press each dough piece to 7-inch-diameter round.  Using small sharp knife, mark each round into 8 wedges.  Press fork tines around edge of each to make notched design.  Bake shortbread 12 minutes.  Reverse sheets.  Bake until shortbread looks dry and feels firm to touch, about 12 minutes longer.  Cool on sheets on racks.  Cut shortbread into wedges along marked lines.  Transfer wedges to work surface.

Place white chocolate in metal bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water.  Stir until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Place bittersweet chocolate in another bowl set over same simmering water.  Stir until melted and smooth.

Fit 2 pastry bags with 1/8-inch plain tips; spoon white chocolate into 1 and dark chocolate into other.  Or, spoon chocolate into 2 small plastic bags (cut off 1 tip from each bag).  Pipe chocolates decoratively over cookies.  Let stand until chocolate sets, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight in single layers between sheets of waxed paper.)

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ICE CREAM ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
     2/3           cup  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  diced peeled cored ripe Bosc pears -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  4                     egg yolks
  2               cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  poire Williams -- (optional)
                        = (clear pear brandy)
                        === PEARS ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3                     ripe Bosc pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and each cut 12 lengthwise slices

For Ice Cream:  Melt butter in heavy 10-inch skillet over medium-low heat.  Add sugar and cook until sugar melts (mixture will be grainy for first 10 to 12 minutes) and turns deep amber, stirring occasionally and pressing on sugar lumps to break up, about 20 minutes.

Add pears (caramel will bubble and harden).  Increase heat to medium-high and boil until liquid thickens and pears are very tender, breaking up large pieces of caramel and stirring occasionally, about 14 minutes.  Transfer mixture to blender.

Beat yolks to blend in medium bowl.  Bring cream to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk hot cream into yolks.  Return cream mixture to same saucepan.  Stir over low heat until custard thickens slightly and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 2 minutes; do not boil.  Immediately add to pear mixture in blender.  Add brandy if desired.  Blend until smooth.  Cover custard and refrigerate until well chilled.

Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Freeze ice cream until firm.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Keep frozen.)

For Pears:  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add sugar and cook until sugar turns deep amber, stirring occasionally and breaking up sugar lumps, about 20 minutes.  Add pears and saute until tender but not mushy and caramel thickens slightly, about 9 minutes.

Arrange 6 pear slices decoratively on each of 6 plates or in shallow bowls.  Scoop ice cream atop pears.  Drizzle with caramel syrup from skillet and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A modern version of a childhood favorite.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEMIFREDDO ===
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
  1               pint  vanilla ice cream -- slightly softened
     1/2           cup  chopped husked toasted hazelnuts
  3        tablespoons  Frangelico liqueur
                        = (or other nut liqueur)
  1              ounce  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely grated
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  Frangelico liqueur
  1              pinch  salt
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
                        === PEARS ===
  6               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  8                     orange peel strips - (1" by 3")
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4              small  firm ripe Anjou, Bartlett or Comice pears -- peeled
     1/4           cup  chopped husked toasted hazelnuts
  4                     orange slices

For Semifreddo:  Line 8-inch square pan with plastic.  Whip 3/4 cup cream to soft peaks in medium bowl.  Mix ice cream, hazelnuts, liqueur, chocolate and orange peel in large bowl just until blended.  Gently fold in whipped cream.  Transfer mixture to prepared pan; smooth top.  Cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 4 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

For Sauce:  Bring cream, liqueur and salt to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Remove from heat and add chocolate.  Let stand 3 minutes.  Whisk until chocolate is melted and sauce is smooth.  Whisk in corn syrup.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Pears:  Stir first 4 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, add pears and simmer until pears are just tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove pears from poaching liquid.  Cool pears and syrup separately.  Return pears to syrup and refrigerate until cold.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.)

Stir chocolate sauce over low heat until warm.  Cut semifreddo into 4 squares.  Place 1 semifreddo piece in each of 4 bowls.  Remove pears from syrup with slotted spoon.  Place pears atop semifreddo.  Spoon chocolate sauce over pears to coat, letting extra sauce drizzle onto semifreddo and plate.  Sprinkle with nuts.  Garnish with orange slices and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dessert is an Italian takeoff on a classic French dish, Poire Belle-HÃˆlÃ‹ne -- poached pear with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Here the pear is teamed with a hazelnut-orangesemifreddo (a sweet Italian frozen mousse) and a Frangelico chocolate sauce.  For smaller appetites, cut the semifreddo into eight portions and the pears in half.

For Semifreddo:  Line 8-inch square pan with plastic.  Whip 3/4 cup cream to soft peaks in medium bowl.  Mix ice cream, hazelnuts, liqueur, chocolate and orange peel in large bowl just until blended.  Gently fold in whipped cream.  Transfer mixture to prepared pan; smooth top.  Cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 4 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sauce:  Bring cream, liqueur and salt to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Remove from heat and add chocolate.  Let stand 3 minutes.  Whisk until chocolate is melted and sauce is smooth.  Whisk in corn syrup.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Pears:  Stir first 4 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, add pears and simmer until pears are just tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove pears from poaching liquid.  Cool pears and syrup separately.  Return pears to syrup and refrigerate until cold.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir chocolate sauce over low heat until warm.  Cut semifreddo into 4 squares.  Place 1 semifreddo piece in each of 4 bowls.  Remove pears from syrup with slotted spoon.  Place pears atop semifreddo.  Spoon chocolate sauce over pears to coat, letting extra sauce drizzle onto semifreddo and plate.  Sprinkle with nuts.  Garnish with orange slices and serve.

Comments:  This dessert is an Italian takeoff on a classic French dish, Poire Belle-HÃˆlÃ‹ne -- poached pear with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  Here the pear is teamed with a hazelnut-orangesemifreddo (a sweet Italian frozen mousse) and a Frangelico chocolate sauce.  For smaller appetites, cut the semifreddo into eight portions and the pears in half.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/2           cup  whipping cream

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2                     boneless pork chops - (5 to 6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  cranberry sauce
  3                     green onions -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme

Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper.  SautÃˆ pork until brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer pork to plate.

Add wine to same skillet.  Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits in bottom of pan.  Stir in remaining ingredients.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly reduced, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Return pork and any juices to skillet.  Cook until heated through, about 1 minute.  Transfer pork to plates.  Spoon sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Here, leftover cranberry sauce (or canned cranberry sauce) and boneless pork chops make a very contemporary little supper.  Freshen up any leftover mashed white or sweet potatoes by stirring in chopped lemon and orange peel.  A salad of bitter greens tossed with a cider vinaigrette, and a simple dessert of grape clusters and spiced bar cookies round things out.

                     Potato And Wild Mushroom Gratin

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chicken stock or canned broth
  2             ounces  dried porcini or shiitake mushrooms
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  3                     leeks, hite and pale green parts only -- chopped
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced 1/8" thick
  2        tablespoons  goose fat
                        = (or 2 tbspns unsalted butter, melted)
                        Minced fresh chives -- for garnish

Bring stock to simmer in medium saucepan.  Add mushrooms; remove from heat.  Let mushrooms soak 30 minutes to soften.  Squeeze mushrooms, reserving stock.  Strain stock.  Chop mushrooms, discarding hard stems.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onions and leeks and saute until tender but not brown, about 20 minutes.  Add mushroom soaking liquid, mushrooms, wine and rosemary and bring to boil.  Season with salt and pepper.

Arrange half of potatoes in prepared dish.  Using slotted spoon, top potatoes with onions, leeks and mushrooms.  Pour half of liquid over.  Top with remaining potatoes, overlapping slices.  Pour remaining liquid over.  Cover with foil.

Bake until potatoes are almost tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Uncover and bake until potatoes are tender, most of liquid is absorbed and top is beginning to brown, about 45 minutes.

Preheat broiler.  Brush potatoes with 2 tablespoons goose fat or butter.  Broil until golden.  Sprinkle with chives.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Haricots verts (small, thin French green beans) would also be nice as a side dish, but regular green beans would be fine, too.

                    Potato Galette With Wild Mushrooms

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  8             ounces  small or medium oyster mushrooms -- trimmed
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     russet potatoes - (12 to 14 oz ea) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8"-thick rounds
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Pour all but 2 tablespoons melted butter into large bowl.  Add mushrooms and garlic to 2 tablespoons butter remaining in skillet; sautÃˆ until mushrooms are tender, about 8 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Brush two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with some of melted butter from bowl.  Line bottom of pans with parchment paper; brush generously with melted butter.

Add potatoes and minced thyme to bowl with remaining melted butter; toss gently to coat. Season potatoes generously with salt and pepper.  Arrange 1 layer of potato slices in bottom of each pan, overlapping slightly.  Top each with second layer of potato slices.  Top each with half of mushrooms.  Cover each with remaining potatoes, dividing equally.  Divide any remaining butter in bowl between pans.

Bake potatoes until tender and very brown and crisp on top (bottom will also be brown and crisp), about 40 minutes.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm potatoes in 350 degrees oven approximately 10 minutes.)

Invert galettes onto platters; peel off parchment.  Cut galettes into wedges.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Crisp rounds of potato are layered with wild mushrooms in this hearty dish.  Prepare both galettes in the morning, then reheat them after the turkey comes out of the oven.

                         Quick Choucroute Garnie

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  fully-cooked smoked sausage (kielbasa) -- cut 3" lengths,
                        then halved lengthwise
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  caraway seeds
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pound  purchased sauerkraut -- drained
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sausage, cut-side down, and cook until browned on bottom, about 3 minutes.  Turn over sausage; add onions, and sautÃˆ until onions are beginning to soften, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.

Stir in remaining ingredients.  Cover and simmer until flavors blend, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Classic choucroute garnie combines sauerkraut, potatoes, and a variety of meats.  Here, chunks of smoked sausage are cooked with sauerkraut and flavored with caraway.  On the side, have boiled red-skinned potatoes tossed with parsley and a spinach salad.  End with purchased apple strudel.

                   Rack Of Lamb With Chutney-Mint Glaze

Recipe By     :Mairi Morrison, London, England
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks lamb - (1 1/4 lbs ea) -- trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  mango chutney
     1/2           cup  mint jelly
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint -- plus
                        Mint sprigs for garnish

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper.  Blend chutney, mint jelly and chopped mint in small saucepan.  Spread 1/4 cup mixture over meat side of each lamb rack.  Place racks on prepared sheet, bone-side down.  Reserve remaining chutney mixture in pan for sauce.

Roast lamb until cooked to desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare (meat thermometer will register 130 degrees).  Cut lamb between bones into individual chops; divide among plates.  Bring chutney sauce to boil, stirring constantly; spoon sauce alongside chops.  Garnish with fresh mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "The recipes here reflect my British roots, but not necessarily my family traditions," writes Mairi Morrison of London, England.  "Although my mother is from Scotland and my father is from Northern Ireland, I grew up in Los Angeles, where our weeknight meals were typically American: spaghetti, tacos, and burgers.  It wasn't until I moved to Europe that I became really interested in food.  Here in London my social life is centered around the table.  I really like this dish because it is typically British, and perfect for a rainy winter evening in London."

This inventive, super-easy glaze is made by mixing fresh mint with purchased mango chutney and mint jelly.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  purchased cheese ravioli
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     3/4           cup  coarsely chopped walnuts
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, or according to directions on package.  Drain.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add walnuts; sautÃˆ until golden, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÃˆ 30 seconds.  Add wine.  Simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Add parsley and rosemary.  Simmer 1 minute.

Add ravioli and toss to coat with sauce.  Season with salt and pepper; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This rich, satisfying main course would be nice with a salad of chopped fresh tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, black olives, and sweet onion.  Crusty breadsticks round out the meal, which might end with a plate of assorted grape clusters and anise biscuits.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2                onion -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  long-grain white rice

Combine remaining 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup prune juice and brush some over goose.  Continue roasting goose until juices run clear when pierced in thickest part of thigh, basting goose with wine mixture and removing fat from pan occasionally, about 2 hours.

Transfer goose to platter and tent with foil.  Let stand 20 minutes.

Strain prune poaching liquid, reserving prunes.  Degrease roasting juices.  Add 1/2 cup poaching liquid to roasting pan and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Transfer to heavy medium saucepan.  Add Armagnac, remaining poaching liquid and degreased roasting juices.  Boil until flavors are intense, about 15 minutes.

Knead butter and flour together.  Whisk into sauce in small bits and simmer until thick, about 8 minutes.  Add poached prunes and chestnuts and heat through.  Sprinkle with parsley.

Carve goose into thin slices.  Spoon sauce, chestnuts and prunes over.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In most of France, turkey with chestnuts has become a standard Christmas dish, but in the southwest, goose is preferred.

Recipe By     :Edi Meadows Morrissette, Westin, FL
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              heads  garlic heads -- top 3/4" of each
                        cut off and discarded
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     3/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  cream cheese -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     French-bread baguette -- cut on diagonal
                        into 1/2"-thk slices

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place garlic, cut-side up, in small glass baking dish; pour oil over each head and sprinkle with salt.  Cover; bake until garlic is tender, about 1 hour.  Uncover; let cool 15 minutes.

Squeeze garlic from each clove into medium bowl and mash.  Mix in Parmesan, cream cheese, mayonnaise, and thyme.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made one day ahead; cover and refrigerate.  Allow to soften slightly at room temperature before continuing.)

Preheat oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Spread garlic mixture on bread slices; arrange on 2 baking sheets.  Bake until toasts are beginning to brown at edges, about 12 minutes.

This recipe yields about 32 toasts.

Comments:  "My profession as a real estate agent requires a lot of my time," writes Edi Meadows Morrissette of Westin, Florida, "so it helps that I am lightning-fast in the kitchen.  I cook every day, and on the weekends I sometimes make three meals a day.  I accomplish that by following my main cooking principles: (1) do a lot of prep work, and (2) keep the kitchen well stocked.  For example, at holiday time I might chop onions in advance or bake bread the day before company arrives.  And since I converted the bedroom next to my kitchen into a pantry for extra storage, I know IÃ­ll always have the right ingredients at my fingertips."

Nice with drinks, soup, or salad.  The cheese spread can be made a day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  amaretto
                        = (or other almond liqueur)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
                        === PEARS ===
  8                     firm but ripe Bosc pears - (abt 3 1/4 lbs) -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, and cored
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  56                    day-old soft ladyfingers - (abt)
                        = (from about three 3-oz packages)
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-crushed amaretti cookies -- (Italian macaroons)
                        = (or almond macaroons)
     3/4           cup  apricot fruit spread -- (100% spreadable fru
                        = (or apricot preserves)
  4        tablespoons  brandy
  4        tablespoons  amaretto
                        = (or other almond liqueur)
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)

For Pastry Cream:  Combine cream and milk in medium saucepan; bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Whisk sugar, egg yolks, flour, amaretto, vanilla, and salt in large bowl until smooth (mixture will be thick and pasty).  Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolk mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until pastry cream boils, thickens and is smooth, about 6 minutes.  Transfer pastry cream to bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of pastry cream; refrigerate overnight.

For Pears:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Toss pear halves, 1/3 cup sugar, and lemon juice in large bowl.  Place pears, cut-side down, on heavy large rimmed baking sheet; pour sugar mixture from bowl over pears.  Roast pears until tender and golden brown in spots, turning occasionally, about 40 minutes.  Cool.  Cut pears into 1/2-inch pieces; place in bowl along with any juices from baking sheet.  (Pears can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Arrange 13 to 14 ladyfingers in bottom of 8-inch-diameter, 3-quart trifle bowl, trimming to fit tightly.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup crushed amaretti cookies over.  Dot with 1/4 cup fruit spread.  Top with 1 cup roasted pears.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon brandy and 1 tablespoon amaretto over.  Spread 1 cup pastry cream over.

Repeat layering 2 more times with ladyfingers, amaretti cookies, fruit spread, pears, brandy, amaretto, and pastry cream.  Top with 13 to 14 ladyfingers; sprinkle with remaining brandy and amaretto.  Spread remaining pastry cream over top.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.

Beat cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until peaks form.  Spread 1 1/2 cups whipped cream over top of trifle.  Spoon remaining whipped cream into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip.  Pipe whipped-cream rosettes around top of trifle.  Garnish with sliced almonds and mint sprigs, if desired.  Refrigerate up to 6 hours.

* Amaretti cookies are available at Italian markets and some supermarkets.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Trifle is a great do-ahead party dessert.  For this one, roast the pears and make the pastry cream the day before.  Use purchased sponge-cake ladyfingers (available in the baked goods section of many supermarkets); unwrap them and leave them at room temperature over-night so that they firm up slightly.

               Roasted Salmon With Cranberry-Mustard Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  walnut oil or olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  4                     boneless salmon fillets with skin -- (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  raw cranberry relish -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spray small baking sheet with nonstick spray.  Whisk oil and mustard in medium bowl to blend.

Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper.  Place on prepared baking sheet, skin-side down.  Brush top of salmon with 2 tablespoons mustard-oil mixture.  Roast salmon until fish is cooked through, about 13 minutes.

Preheat broiler.  Whisk cranberry relish, shallots, and vinegar into remaining mustard-oil mixture.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Broil salmon until top is browning in spots, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to plates.  Spoon sauce over; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A terrific way to finish off the cranberry relish.  Make full use of your oven -- and your time -- by roasting small red-skinned potatoes alongside the fish, then tossing the potatoes with butter and parsley to have as a side dish.  Boil slim green beans or haricots verts to complement the main course.  End the meal with slices of marble pound cake ("toasted" briefly in the oven) topped with chocolate sauce and whipped cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh Italian parsley - (packed)
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  bacon -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2           cups  frozen corn kernels
  1 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  3            bottles  clam juice -- (8 ounce)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1              pound  bay scallops -- connective tissue
                        removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Blend parsley, oil, and salt in blender until smooth.  Pour into small bowl.  (Parsley oil can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Cook bacon in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until crisp and brown.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot.

Add leeks, garlic, and thyme to pot and sautÃˆ until leeks begin to soften, about 3 minutes.  Add corn and sautÃˆ 2 minutes.  Add potatoes, clam juice, and cream; bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.

Add scallops and bacon and simmer until scallops are just opaque in center, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle chowder into bowls.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon parsley oil atop chowder in each bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  This elegant first course from American Seasons is topped with parsley oil, which is easy to make and could also be drizzled over roasted fish or steamed potatoes, and other vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1              large  egg
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  blanched slivered almonds - (abt 6 oz)
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  almond extract
                        Powdered sugar
                        Apricot preserves

For Dough:  Sift first 6 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl until blended.  Beat in egg.  Add flour mixture and beat until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Flatten dough into disks; wrap and chill at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled.  Soften slightly before rolling.)

For Filling:  Blend first 8 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely chopped.  Transfer to small bowl.  Cover; chill at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan.  Roll out larger dough piece on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to pan and press gently over bottom and up sides, pressing any tears together.  Spread filling in dough.  Trim dough on sides to 1/2 inch above level of filling.  Fold dough in over filling.

Roll out second dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round.  Using bottom of cake pan as aid, cut out 9-inch-diameter round of dough.  Slide dough round onto plate and freeze 5 minutes to firm.  Reserve dough scraps for cookies.  Place chilled dough round on tart; press to adhere and seal edges.

Bake tart until crust is brown, about 50 minutes.  Remove sides of springform pan; cool tart completely on pan bottom.  Maintain oven temperature.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out dough scraps on lightly floured surface to scant 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 2-inch gingerbread-man cutter, cut out cookies.  Transfer cutouts to prepared sheets.  Repeat, using all of dough.

Bake cookies until golden, about 8 minutes.  Cool cookies on sheets.  (Tart and cookies can be made ahead; cover and store at room temperature 1 day or refrigerate up to 3 days.)  Sift powdered sugar over top of tart.  Place small dab of preserves on back of 1 cookie; place at top edge of tart.  Repeat with more cookies, forming border around tart.  Transfer tart to platter.  Let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Dutch speculaas cookies are similar in taste to gingerbread men.  This treat combines the spiced speculaas dough with another Dutch tradition: giving almond-filled tarts as gifts.  Use a two-inch gingerbread-man cutter to make the cookies for the topping.

Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Flatten dough into disks; wrap and chill at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled.  Soften slightly before rolling.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Blend first 8 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely chopped.  Transfer to small bowl.  Cover; chill at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan.  Roll out larger dough piece on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to pan and press gently over bottom and up sides, pressing any tears together.  Spread filling in dough.  Trim dough on sides to 1/2 inch above level of filling.  Fold dough in over filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out second dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round.  Using bottom of cake pan as aid, cut out 9-inch-diameter round of dough.  Slide dough round onto plate and freeze 5 minutes to firm.  Reserve dough scraps for cookies.  Place chilled dough round on tart; press to adhere and seal edges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake tart until crust is brown, about 50 minutes.  Remove sides of springform pan; cool tart completely on pan bottom.  Maintain oven temperature.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out dough scraps on lightly floured surface to scant 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 2-inch gingerbread-man cutter, cut out cookies.  Transfer cutouts to prepared sheets.  Repeat, using all of dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake cookies until golden, about 8 minutes.  Cool cookies on sheets.  (Tart and cookies can be made ahead; cover and store at room temperature 1 day or refrigerate up to 3 days.)  Sift powdered sugar over top of tart.  Place small dab of preserves on back of 1 cookie; place at top edge of tart.  Repeat with more cookies, forming border around tart.  Transfer tart to platter.  Let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  Dutch speculaas cookies are similar in taste to gingerbread men.  This treat combines the spiced speculaas dough with another Dutch tradition: giving almond-filled tarts as gifts.  Use a two-inch gingerbread-man cutter to make the cookies for the topping.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  water
  1 1/2         pounds  large ripe strawberries
  1 1/2           cups  fresh grapefruit juice
  1 1/2           cups  dry Champagne
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)

Combine 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil 1 minute.  Cool.  Refrigerate syrup until cold, about 45 minutes.

Puree enough strawberries (about 6 large) in blender to yield 1/2 cup puree.  Transfer strawberry puree to large bowl.  Mix grapefruit juice, Champagne, lemon juice and chilled syrup into strawberry puree.  Pour mixture into 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.

Freeze Champagne mixture until icy at edge of pan, about 55 minutes.  Whisk to distribute frozen portions evenly.  Freeze again until icy at edge of pan and overall texture is slushy, about 40 minutes.  Whisk to distribute frozen portions evenly.  Cover and freeze until mixture is solid, about 3 hours.

Meanwhile, slice remaining strawberries.  Place in large bowl and toss with remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Grand Marnier.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.

Using fork, scrape granita down length of pan, forming ice flakes.  (Granita can be prepared up to 2 days ahead of time.  Cover and freeze until ready to serve.)

Divide sliced strawberries equally among 6 wine glasses.  Top with granita and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "The citrus-Champagne granita was the perfect ending to a dinner I had at The Harvest in Pomfret, Connecticut," writes Phyllis A. Nigris of Johnston, Rhode Island.  "I love this type of cool, refreshing dessert, so I would be grateful if you could obtain the recipe."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boned skinned chicken breast halves -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-thk strips
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  cream Sherry
  1         tablespoon  grated tangerine peel
     1/2           cup  fresh tangerine juice
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut into
                        matchstick-size strips
  15                    snow peas -- trimmed
  1                     green onion -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl.  Cover and chill 30 minutes.

Whisk juice, vinegar, and cornstarch in medium bowl to blend.  Set aside.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic, ginger, and cayenne; sautÃˆ 15 seconds.  Add chicken mixture; stir-fry until just cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Transfer chicken to plate.

Add bell pepper, peas, and onion to same skillet.  Stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.

Return chicken to skillet.  Stir juice mixture to recombine and add to skillet.  Simmer until sauce thickens, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This quick dish gets its flavor from fresh tangerine peel as well as the fruit's juice.  To make easy work of grating the peel, choose tangerines with firm skin and store them in the refrigerator.  Then use a hand grater or a Microplane grater-zester to grate the peel.

Comments:  This quick dish gets its flavor from fresh tangerine peel as well as the fruit&apos;s juice.  To make easy work of grating the peel, choose tangerines with firm skin and store them in the refrigerator.  Then use a hand grater or a Microplane grater-zester to grate the peel.

Comments:  "Last summer I visited my sister in Los Angeles for a week of shopping, going to the beach and dining out," writes Donna M. Savage of Framingham, Massachusetts.  "My favorite meal of the trip was at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills.  I had an Indian-style chicken salad that was wonderfully spicy and flavorful.  I'd love to try the recipe at home and was hoping that you could get it for me."

  12             whole  red-and-white-striped hard
                        peppermint candies -- chopped
                        Fresh mint leaves

For Filling:  Place chocolate in medium bowl.  Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan.  Pour hot mixture over chocolate; add extract and let stand 1 minute.  Whisk until mixture is smooth.  Let filling stand at room temperature while cake is baking and cooling.

For Cake:  Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom with parchment paper.  Butter parchment.  Dust pan with flour.

Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Gradually beat in both sugars, then vanilla.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions each.  Mix in chocolate chips.

Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack 5 minutes.  Turn out cake onto rack.  Peel off parchment.  Cool completely.

Using electric mixer, beat filling until fluffy and lightened in color, about 30 seconds.  Using serrated knife, cut cake horizontally in half.  Place 1 layer, cut-side up, on rack set over baking sheet.  Spread filling over.  Top with second layer, cut-side down.  Chill filled cake 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Glaze:  Stir chocolate, butter, and corn syrup in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth.  Mix in extract.  Cool glaze until just lukewarm but still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Pour 1/2 cup glaze over center of cake.  Spread over top and sides of cake.  Chill until glaze sets, about 15 minutes.  Pour remaining glaze over center of cake, then spread quickly over top and sides.  Chill until glaze sets, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; chill.  Before continuing, let stand at room temperature until softened, about 4 hours.)

Sprinkle candies around top edge of cake.  Garnish with fresh mint leaves.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The cake can be made a day ahead and refrigerated; bring it to room temperature to serve.  If desired, you can garnish the cake with sugared mint leaves: Whisk egg whites until they are foamy, then brush them over mint leaves and sprinkle leaves with sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     one-inch-diameter black truffles from jar*
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     turkey - (abt 16 lbs) -- neck reserved
  8              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  4              large  fresh parsley sprigs
  6                     bay leaves
  12             large  shallots - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, cut in half
  3               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
     1/2           cup  Cognac or brandy
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               jars  whole roasted peeled chestnuts -- (7.4 oz ea)
                        = (available at specialty foods stores
                        and some supermarkets)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Coarsely chop 1 1/2 truffles; place in processor.  Add butter; process mixture until well blended and truffles are finely chopped, about 1 minute.  Season truffle butter with salt and pepper.  Thinly slice remaining 1/2 truffle; cover and chill.

Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle main cavity with salt and pepper.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub truffle butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, over breast meat under skin.  Rub any truffle butter that remains on hands all over outside of turkey.  Place turkey on small rack set in large roasting pan.

Using kitchen string, tie 4 thyme sprigs, 2 parsley sprigs, and 3 bay leaves together.  Repeat with remaining 4 thyme sprigs, 2 parsley sprigs, and 3 bay leaves.  Place 1 herb bouquet in main cavity of turkey and 1 in neck cavity.  Tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Cover turkey with plastic wrap.  Chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Tuck turkey wings under.  Place shallots and turkey neck around turkey in pan.  Sprinkle turkey, shallots, and neck with salt and pepper.  Roast until turkey and shallots are golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Gently stir shallots.  Pour 1 cup broth over turkey.  Roast 30 minutes.  Pour 1 cup broth over turkey.  Cover turkey breast and legs loosely with foil.

Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting every 30 minutes with pan drippings and adding 1 cup more broth to pan after 45 minutes, about 1 hour 15 minutes longer.  Transfer turkey to platter; tent loosely with foil.  Let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).  Using slotted spoon, transfer shallots to bowl.  Discard turkey neck.

Pour pan juices into 4-cup measuring cup.  Spoon off fat from top of pan juices, reserving 6 tablespoons fat.  Discard remaining fat.  Add enough chicken broth to pan juices to measure 3 cups.  Pour Cognac into roasting pan; place over low heat and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Add to pan juices.

Melt 2 tablespoons reserved turkey fat in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add flour and stir 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in pan juices.  Boil until sauce thickens very slightly, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes (gravy will be thin).  Stir reserved sliced 1/2 truffle into gravy.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm.

Melt 4 tablespoons fat in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chestnuts and sautÃˆ until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Add roasted shallots and chopped parsley; sautÃˆ until heated through, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Surround turkey with chestnut-shallot mixture.  Serve with gravy.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This turkey is roasted in true French fashion with black truffles and shallots.  Prepare the truffle butter and rub it over the turkey the day before roasting.  A red Burgundy complements the earthy truffle flavor.

Increase heat to medium-high, add onions and sautÃˆ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Mix in potatoes, milk, broth, cream of potato soup, and 1 tablespoon sage.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Add turkey meat, bacon, and remaining 1 tablespoon sage.  Simmer until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For a variation, you could throw in a cup of cooked vegetables left over from Thanksgiving to add texture to this creamy chowder.  Serve the soup with chowder crackers, along with a spinach and pear salad.  Purchased apple turnovers would make an ideal dessert.
