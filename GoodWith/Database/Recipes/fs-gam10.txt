                        Snipe, Coot, Rail, and Moorhen

At one time or another, most hunters have sampled a meal of quail, dove, duck, goose or wild turkey.  But what about our lesser-known game birds?  Ever eaten a snipe or rail?  Moorhens and coots are excellent eating, but would you know how to cook one if you bagged it?  Would you cook it if you did?

All these birds are superb table fare when properly prepared.  Since they generally have little fat, moist cooking methods (stewing, braising, cooking in a crockpot, etc.) are best.  Frequent basting or wrapping in bacon or salt pork also helps preserve moistness.

For the best taste, cook until rare or medium-rare.  Never overcook, or the meat will be dry and tough.

Recipes for these dark-meated game birds are interchangeable.  Vary the ingredients or cooking time as necessary to account for slight differences in size or the portion of the bird you choose to cook (breast only, whole bird, etc.)

At the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, we receive lots of phone calls and letters from people wanting to know how to cook roughfish -- carp, buffalo, gar, bowfins, drum, suckers, eels, paddlefish and sturgeon.  These neglected fish are common in fishing waters statewide and are frequently caught by anglers seeking more popular species.

Bowfishermen take hundreds of thousands of pounds each year, yet many have no idea how to prepare a roughfish so it's fit to eat.  Contrary to popular opinion, most roughfish are mighty good eating, a fact confirmed by the millions of pounds caught and sold by commercial fishermen each year.  We're not out to change folks eating likes, but we want to be sure good-eating wildlife isn't wasted.  We figure fewer roughfish will be thrown away, and there'll be a lot more people fishing for them, if folks know roughfish can be fixed to taste just as good as more popular food fish.  Try the recipes presented here, and discover the fine culinary qualities of these underwater outcasts.

Cleaning Roughfish

Carp and Buffalo:  First "fleece" the large scales off the skin in a single layer with a sharp knife.  Insert the knife just forward of the tail, then working toward the head with short, sawing cuts, remove the scales along the side, leaving the skin intact.  Unless it will be cooked whole, fillet the fish, cutting through the ribs to produce fillets with skin on one side and the ribs attached.  Divide each fillet into two long pieces by cutting lengthwise along the lateral line.  Then remove the dark red meat along the lateral line portion of each piece.  Now, cut the rib section off each piece, and slice between the ribs, creating strips that each contain two or three ribs.  Cut the remaining meat in smaller portions, if desired, and score each piece across the grain at 1/8-inch intervals along the entire length, slicing to, but not through, the skin.  This virtually eliminates the free-floating Y-bones when the meat is cooked.

Suckers (including Hog Sucker, Spotted Sucker, Redhorse, Quillback and Carpsucker):  The flesh of suckers is laced with fine Y-bones.  One way to avoid these is to skin the fish and use a fillet knife to cut long thin strips of meat from the side of each fish, starting near the head and slicing to the tail.  The strips should be thin like bacon.  Suckers can also be prepared like carp and buffalo.

Paddlefish (Spoonbill, Spoonbill Cat):  Paddlefish have firm, boneless fillets similar in texture and quality to swordfish.  To dress, hang the fish by its bill.  Make a circular cut just above the tail, without cutting the skeletal cartilage.  Break the cartilage by twisting the tail, then remove the notochord, an elastic white cord similar to a spinal cord.  This will stretch to nearly double its length when pulled out.  Slice the skin behind the head and down the back to the dorsal fin.  With the aid of pliers, remove the skin, then gut the fish and remove the head.  Remove all red meat.  Fillet or cut into steaks.

American Eel:  Eels are slimy and slippery.  Rub salt on your hands for a better grip; or grab the eel with a piece of brown paper grocery bag.  Secure the eel's head with a nail, string or cleaning board clamp.  Make a circular cut just through the skin around the neck.  Skin, eviscerate and remove the head.  Cut in two-inch pieces and make a slit along the backbone of each piece.  This cuts the muscles so the eel won't jump in the frying pan.  It's also a good idea to parboil eel chunks 2 or 3 minutes before cooking.

Bowfins (Grinnel, Mudfish, Dogfish):  The flesh of bowfins is poor in quality -- tough, stringy and cottony.  If you insist on eating them, they should be bled as soon as caught and kept on ice until ready for cooking.  Grinnel flesh gets mushy when keep too long after being caught.  They can be served whole, pan-dressed or filleted, just like largemouth bass, but for the best flavor, remove the skin and all dark red meat.

Drum (Gaspergou, Sheepshead):  Contrary to popular belief, drum do not possess the many small "Y-bones" found in carp and buffalo.  Filleting your catch and removing all dark red flesh along the lateral line produces boneless strips of meat.  The cooked meat is firm, not flaky, and can be broiled, baked, fried, smoked, canned or made into chowder.

Gar:  Gar are a staple in Louisiana fish markets, often selling for as much as $4.50 a pound.  For the best-tasting fish, bleed and gut your catch as soon as possible and place it on ice.  To dress the fish, use heavy shears to cut down the back and shuck it out of its skin.  Then fillet the long strips of meat away from the back-bone, and cut into serving-sized pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    catfish fillets - (6 to 10 oz ea)
  1              pound  unsalted butter - (4 sticks) -- melted, kept warm
                        === BLACKENING SPICE ===
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano

Before leaving home, use a fork to thoroughly combine blackening spice ingredients in a small bowl.  Store in an airtight container until ready to use.

Heat a large cast-iron skillet until it is almost white hot.  Dip each piece of fish in melted butter, then sprinkle some blackening spice mix evenly on each side.  Immediately place the fish in the hot skillet, cooking one piece at a time.

Pour a teaspoon of melted butter atop the fish.  (Be careful; the butter may flame up.)  Cook about two minutes, turn, and pour another teaspoon of butter on top.  Cook two minutes more.  When the fish is done, it should be flaky, white and still very moist inside.

Serve each piece while piping hot with more hot melted butter on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  goose
     1/2      teaspoon  sage
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse and dry goose inside and out.  Rub the cavity with salt and pepper.  Put the bird in a roasting pan and in the oven so the meat is about 4 inches from the broiler.  Brown on all sides, turning frequently -- total broiling time will be about 15 to 20 minutes.

Add sage, garlic, wine and stock or boullion to the pan.  Bring the liquid to a simmer, cover and place in a 350 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours.  Turn the goose twice during cooking.  Goose is done when the leg moves easily at the joint.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     crappie fillets abt 10" long
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  3          teaspoons  paprika
  3             ounces  cognac
  1                cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  brown sugar
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        Ground or fresh thyme -- to taste
                        Ground or fresh basil -- to taste
                        Ground or fresh parsley -- to taste

Combine the thyme, basil, parsley, cayenne pepper, garlic and paprika and sprinkle over fish in a shallow bowl.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet and add fish, cooking until soft but not hard.  Cook for 2 minutes per side.  The idea is to not dry out the fish.

After the fish have been cooked on both sides, remove fish and add brown sugar to pan.  Then add remaining butter and return the fish to the pan once the sugar is melted.  This will glaze the fish and finish cooking them.

Remove fish to serving plate and deglaze skillet with cognac immediately, adding heavy cream once cognac is boiling.  Reduce by 25 percent.

Combine a small portion of liquid with corn starch and add to sauce.  Allow sauce to boil for about one minute.  Pour sauce on top of fish and garnish with fresh parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                             Fabulous Rabbit

Recipe By     :Liz Wiesemann

Categories    : Main Dish                       Rabbit / Hare
                Small Game

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rabbit - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned, and
                        cut into pieces
  1                     large can artichoke hearts
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  shallots -- chopped
  20                    good oil cured olives
  4                     fresh sage leaves - (to 6)
  1              sprig  fresh margoram
  1                cup  good white wine
                        Chicken stock -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  2           teaspoon  fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Once the rabbit has been cleaned, joint the meat and then cut into chunks, use a cleaver to do this.  You want the meat attached to the bones.  The artichoke hearts should be cut into quarters.  (If you can get good fresh artichoke hearts then by all means use them, if not then use the canned ones, just make sure to drain them thoroughly.)

Heat the olive oil in a very large frying pan till not quite smoking, put in the onion and cook till they are light and softened.  Now add the rabbit pieces, olives, sage, marjoram, wine, some stock and the salt and pepper.  Stir well, cover and let simmer for at least 1/2 hour.  Add more stock if necessary to keep everything nice and moist.  Add the artichokes, tomato paste and parsley and simmer for another 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe tastes great with nice oven roasted potatoes, that have been cut and tossed with some good herbs such as basil, onion and garlic, salt and pepper and roasted in a very hot 475 degree oven till potatoes are done.  Delicious!

Before leaving on your fishing trip, make an herb butter by blending the chives, parsley, oregano and creamed butter.

Pack in a small waterproof container, and store on ice.  Also carry an 18-inch square of aluminum foil for each bream.

At meal time, spread each piece of foil rather thickly with the herb-butter mixture, leaving two inches of unbuttered border all around.  Put a fish on each piece of foil, salt and pepper to taste, and squeeze on a little lemon juice.  Then fold the foil around the fish, and double fold the edges to seal in the juices.

Place a cooking grate six to eight inches above the fire, and grill 25 to 30 minutes, turning once.  Serve in the foil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
     1/3           cup  sherry - (good sherry)
     1/3           cup  chopped onion
     3/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon)
  1           teaspoon  thinly-sliced garlic - (real thin)
  1                     rabbit -- cut 6 pieces
                        === PEANUT-CHILI SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  dry sherry
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  Creamy peanut butter
  3        tablespoons  bottled chili sauce - (to 4)
                        = (or chili salsa)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine all ingredients for marinade and marinate rabbit.  Refrigerate from 6 hours to overnight.

Heat up the grill.  Remove rabbit from marinade and pat dry with paper towels.  Grill over hot heat, turning once and basting frequently with the marinade from 10 to 12 minutes.  Check the loin pieces for doneness.  When done remove from heat and keep warm.  Baste the legs again and continue cooking until done about 5 to 7 minutes longer.  Hopefully the leg meat with stay moist and meat will easily pull away from the bone.

To make the sauce:  Combine sherry, cream and peanut butter in a small heavy saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer.  Add chili sauce, and lime juice and continue simmering, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens.  This shouldn't take any more than 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper

To serve, cook up some thin spaghettis or linguini.  After pasta has cooked to your liking, place some on each plate, place a serving on rabbit on top and serve the sauce on the side for dipping.  You will really like this, especially with rabbit.  If your tired of rabbit cooked the same old way, try this way.  You won't regret it.

                    John's Family Smoked Salmon Recipe

Recipe By     :John Koenig
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Salmon

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salmon
                        === BRINE ===
  2               cups  brown sugar
     1/3           cup  salt (pickling or coarse)
  2        tablespoons  garlic salt
  2        tablespoons  onion salt
  2        tablespoons  celery salt
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard
  2        tablespoons  coarse black pepper

First thing you will need of course is some fish, preferably frozen first and then thawed out.  Freezing your fish first will help to break down the meat's enzymes making it easier to accept a brine and speeding up the curing process.

Mix brine ingredients together in a large mixing bowl.  As this is a dry brine recipe, no liquids should be added.

You will need a large 2-inch deep pan to cure fish in.  Place fillets skin-side down in your pan and coat heavily with brine ingredients.  Cover with a piece of foil or Saran wrap and place in refrigerator for 24 hours.

After salmon has cured for 24 hours remove from refrigerator and rinse fillets off in cool water.  Pat dry with paper towels and place on smoker rack.

If you like a stronger tasting smoked salmon as I do, you can pepper lightly and brush fillets with liquid and brine left over in the bottom of the tray you used to brine your fish.

Use either alder or apple wood for smoking.  Smoke to desired doneness.  Depending on the size and thickness of the fillets you are smoking, it can take anywhere from 4 to 6 hours to smoke.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Description:
  "This recipe is a family recipe used by our family for years.  It
  works not only for salmon but trout and sturgeon as well"

First thing you will need of course is some fish, preferably frozen first and then thawed out.  Freezing your fish first will help to break down the meat&apos;s enzymes making it easier to accept a brine and speeding up the curing process.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix brine ingredients together in a large mixing bowl.  As this is a dry brine recipe, no liquids should be added.
</DirT>
<DirT>
You will need a large 2-inch deep pan to cure fish in.  Place fillets skin-side down in your pan and coat heavily with brine ingredients.  Cover with a piece of foil or Saran wrap and place in refrigerator for 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After salmon has cured for 24 hours remove from refrigerator and rinse fillets off in cool water.  Pat dry with paper towels and place on smoker rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you like a stronger tasting smoked salmon as I do, you can pepper lightly and brush fillets with liquid and brine left over in the bottom of the tray you used to brine your fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use either alder or apple wood for smoking.  Smoke to desired doneness.  Depending on the size and thickness of the fillets you are smoking, it can take anywhere from 4 to 6 hours to smoke.

This recipe is a family recipe used by our family for years.  It works not only for salmon but trout and sturgeon as well

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     squirrels -- cut serving pieces
  3             quarts  water
  2             slices  bacon -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz) -- drained
  2               cups  diced potatoes
  2               cups  fresh or frozen lima beans
  2               cups  fresh or frozen corn

Place the squirrels in a stew pot, add water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until the meat pulls easily from the bone, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Skim the surface of the water occasionally.

Separate meat from bones, and return the meat to the broth.  Add the remaining ingredients, except corn, and cook for one hour.  Add corn, and cook 10 minutes more.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is a quick and easy version of Brunswick Stew, a dish that had its origins in 1820s Virginia.  It's traditionally cooked outdoors over an open fire in a Dutch oven or black-iron cauldron, but it tastes almost a good prepared on the stovetop.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    doves
     1/2           cup  sherry
  2               cans  mushrooms - (4 oz ea)
                        = (use fresh of you want)
  7        tablespoons  sweet creamy butter
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        = (if not use dry)
  3 1/2    tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  chicken broth (low-sodium is best)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        = (add pepper during final stages)

Melt butter in heavy skillet till just melted.  Brown the doves, do not overcrowd the skillet and cook slowly, you don't want to toughen the meat by cooking to fast.  Remove the doves, and add the flour to the skillet.  Stir well till it gets a little color.  Now add the broth and the sherry.  Cook till it thickens slightly.  Add salt if you like and pepper to taste.  (I love pepper).

Place the doves in a two-quart casserole, pour the sauce overall, and then add your mushrooms and parsley.  Cover and bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.

If you can get some wild rice, then by all means serve it with this dish.  Or even better, serve with a combination white and wild rice.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  salmon - (to 2) -- whole or steaked
  1             bottle  liquid smoke
  1                     onion sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  8        tablespoons  butter

Rub salmon thoroughly with liquid smoke.  Place fish in foil.  Put onion, garlic and butter in pocket of fish or on top if steaked.  Squeeze lemon juice and sprinkle white wine over all.  Salt and pepper lightly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bass fillets - (abt 8 oz ea)
  6             slices  bacon -- cut 1" pieces
  4             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into bite-size pieces
     1/2           cup  sliced green pepper in strips
  1                jar  whole pimientos - (4 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into strips
     1/2           cup  corn meal
     1/2           cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Saute the bacon pieces in a large cast-iron skillet until almost, but not quite, crisp.  Spoon out a little of the bacon grease into a cup (to cook the fish in), and add potatoes, green pepper and pimientos.  Cook, stirring, until potatoes are nicely browned and bacon is crisp.

While the potatoes are cooking, shake together the corn meal, flour, salt and pepper in a zip-seal plastic bag.  Add the fish fillets, and shake to coat.

Push the potatoes to one side of the skillet, then add the extra bacon grease, and heat.  Add as many fish fillets as you can without crowding them, and cook until the coating is crispy and golden.  Cook remaining fillets, and serve piping hot with potatoes on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh wild goose - (abt 12 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
  4               cups  cooked wild rice
     2/3           cup  chopped toasted hazelnuts
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  ground savory
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  water

Mix together the cooked rice, nuts, apples, onion, and herbs.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Remove the neck, heart, and gizzard from the goose.  Wash the bird inside and out.  Pat dry.

Fill the cavity of the goose with the stuffing, skewer closed, and lace string around the skewers.  Truss the bird.

Roast in a preheated 325 degree oven, breast-side down, for 1 1/2 hours.  Draw off the fat as it accumulates.  Turn, and roast another 1 1/2 hours.  When done, the juices should run clear when the bird is pricked where the thigh attaches to the body.  Remove trussing strings and skewers before carving.

While the goose is roasting, place the neck, heart, and gizzard in a saucepan with water.  Let simmer gently, partially covered, for several hours, until reduced to slightly less than 2 cups.  Season the broth to taste with salt.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the roasting pan.  Sprinkle a little flour over the bottom, 1 to 2 tablespoons, depending on how thick you like your gravy.  Set the pan over low heat.  Stir for 2 minutes, scraping up all the browned bits.  Add the reserved goose broth to the pan, and whisk until smooth.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.  Serve in a gravy boat alongside the bird.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  lard
  2             pounds  venison -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  flour -- in a paper bag
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  5        tablespoons  ground red chili's (hot)
  3        tablespoons  ground red chili's (mild)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

  4               cups  beef broth
  6               cups  stewed pinto beans -- stewed or canned

Melt the lard in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Coat the cubes with the flour that has been put in a paper bag.  Shake well to evenly coat the cubed venison.  Add the venison to the melted lard and brown well.

Add the onion and garlic and cook till the onion is soft.  Remove from the heat and stir in the ground chili's, coating the venison and onion mixture well.  Add the remaining seasonings and stir, then add a small amount of broth.  Over low heat cook, stirring, until the mixture is smooth and thick.  Continue to add the broth a little at a time, stirring until all is added.  Cook, uncovered for up to 2 hours.

Serve with a dish of stewed pinto beans.  The way this dish was originally planned to be served was to ladle the beans into a dish and then top with the chili mixture.  Not all chili dishes have to incorporate tomatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  turkey -- skin on
  4                     strips bacon
  1              large  onion -- peeled, quartered
  1              large  apple -- cored, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Working from the front, lift the skin from the turkey's breast, and slide two strips of bacon beneath it on each side.  Secure the loosened skin with toothpicks.  Place the onion and apple inside the body cavity.

Cook about four hours in a smoker, using damp hickory, apple, pecan or cherry wood to provide smoke and flavor.  Check for doneness every 30 minutes, beginning at 2 1/2 hours, by pricking deeply with a cooking fork.

When juice running from the hole is clear, not pink, the bird should be done.  (Depending on the bird's size and the smoker's temperature, cooking time will vary considerably.)

Keep the fire low and smoky, so the turkey cooks throughout without drying too much on the outside.  A small pan of water placed inside the smoker helps keep the bird moist.

This recipe yields ?? servings.
