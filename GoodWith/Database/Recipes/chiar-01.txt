  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  fresh arugula - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  pure olive oil
  2         tablespoon  pine nuts -- toasted, plus
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts
     1/8      teaspoon  vitamin C -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Prepare an ice water bath in a large bowl, and bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Put the arugula in a large sieve and plunge it into the boiling water.  Immediately immerse all the arugula and stir so that it blanches evenly.  Blanch for about 15 seconds.  Remove, shake off the excess water, then plunge the arugula into the ice water bath and stir again so it cools as fast as possible.  Drain well.

Squeeze the water out of the arugula with your hands until very dry.  Roughly chop the arugula and put in a blender.  Add the garlic, salt and pepper to taste, olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the pine nuts, and the vitamin C, if using.  Blend for at least 30 seconds.  In this way the green of the arugula will thoroughly color the oil.  Add the cheese and pulse to combine.  The pesto will keep several days in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator.

Pull out before dinner to get to room temperature.  Before serving, add the remaining 1 tablespoon toasted pinenuts.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus -- ends trimmed,
                        and peeled
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2             cloves  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  Cambozola cheese -- broken into pieces
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped thyme leaves
     1/2                loaf day-old bread -- cut into cubes

Fill a deep frying pan halfway full with water and bring to a boil.  Add asparagus to the boiling water and add salt and olive oil; boil for 6 minutes.  Remove asparagus to a sheet pan or plate to cool, and place in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes.  Then chop into bite-size pieces, perfect for dipping.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and saute for about 1 minute.  Add cream and simmer until reduced by half.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add cheese, bit by bit, whisking as you go.  As 1 piece melts, add another, until no cheese remains.  Then add thyme and stir to combine.  Serve with cubes of day-old bread and the cooled asparagus pieces.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  8                     garlic cloves -- minced
  6                     anchovies -- (optional)
  1              large  pinch chili flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley leaves

In a hot pan, pour a good amount of olive oil in.  When the oil starts to warm up, add garlic and turn the flame down.

Add the anchovies, if using (don't worry about mincing them as they will dissolve in the mixture).  The anchovies should cook in the garlic oil until the garlic becomes brown and the anchovies dissolve.

When the garlic gets light brown, about 5 minutes, add chili flakes until they toast up and then turn flame off.  Add more olive oil and salt and pepper for flavor.

Right before you heat the sauce in your fondue pot, add some minced parsley to cook in the sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  fresh basil
  1                cup  pure olive oil

Tear the leaves off of the basil and place in a blender with the olive oil.  Puree until smooth.  Pour mixture into a large saucepan or skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a sterilized airtight jar or bottle.  Store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields 1 1/3 cups.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars:
   Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.

Sterilizing Tips:
   Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.

To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.

Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.

As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.

After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars:&#013;&#010;   Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sterilizing Tips:&#013;&#010;   Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

                         Bistecca All Fiorentina

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Porterhouse steaks, abt 2" thick - -- (abt 2 lbs ea)
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Pure olive oil -- as needed
                        Great balsamic vinegar -- to taste

Let the steak rest outside the refrigerator for 30 minutes before cooking.  Use a hot, clean, oiled grill.  If pan roasting, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Liberally season the steak with the salt and pepper, coat with olive oil and press the seasoning into the meat.  Grill the steaks for about 5 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-rare.  The fillet will cook a little faster than the strip loin.  Move the steaks every 2 minutes or so for even cooking and a crispy exterior.

For pan roasting, heat a cast-iron skillet with a little olive oil until smoking hot.  Turn on the fan, open the window and stand back to avoid getting splattered!  Using tongs, place the steaks in the center of the pan.  Cook until the first side is seared brown, about 4 minutes.  Turn the steaks and place the pan in the oven until the steaks are done, about 6 minutes for medium-rare.  Remove the steaks to a carving board and let rest for at least 5 minutes before carving.

Cut the steaks away from the bone and carve into 1/2-inch slices.  Arrange the meat on warmed plates and drizzle a little bit of balsamic vinegar over the slices.  Serve with some extra gray sea salt on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The classic Bistecca all Fiornentina is a large porterhouse steak that usually weighs around 1 kilo (2.2 pounds).  In Tuscan restaurants the steak is offered by the "etto" or in 100 gram (4-ounce) increments.  This great steak includes both the strip loin and the fillet.  When shopping for this dish use the best, meat, gray sea salt, course grind black pepper and the best balsamic vinegar that you can afford.  The marriage of flavors from all of these ingredients will reveal a noble meal of authentic Italian cookery.  As is true for all steak cooking and to ensure a juicy, flavorful steak that cooks quickly, have the meat at room temperature before starting.  Use a grill or thick cast-iron pan and make sure that they are very hot.  Always let the meat rest, at least 5 minutes, before carving and a sharp knife will glide right through.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting work surface
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled briefly
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  brandy
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  ground anise seeds
  4               cups  peanut or vegetable oil - (to 6) -- for deep-frying
  2               cups  powdered sugar - (about)

Sift the flour with the baking powder, salt, and sugar and set aside.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix together the eggs, butter, orange juice, brandy, vanilla, and anise seeds until well blended.  Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and adheres to the paddle.

Remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured board.  Knead by hand until smooth.  Form the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, and place in a bowl.  Cover with a tea towel and chill at least 2 hours or up to overnight to allow the dough to relax.

Heat the oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, cut the dough into 4 or 6 equal pieces.  Keeping the dough and work surface well floured, pass the dough through the widest setting of a pasta machine 3 or 4 times.  Then pass through successively narrower settings until the dough is almost thin enough to see through; depending on your pasta machine, this will probably be the next to thinnest setting.

Cut the dough into long strips 3 inches wide, then cut the strips on the diagonal into pieces about 3 inches long.  If the dough tears, cut it off and work it back into the dough.  The cookies curl when they fry, so fancier shapes are not important.  As the cookies are cut, transfer them to baking sheets lined with flour-dusted tea towels, and cover with tea towels so they won't dry out before frying.  Fry in batches, turning once, until puffed and golden brown, about 1 minute.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.

While the cookies are still hot, dust them well with powdered sugar.  Wait for a few minutes while the oil and heat absorb and melt most of this first coating.  Dust well a second time until the cookies are quite white.  The cookies will keep for a week or so in an airtight container.  You may need to re-dust them with sugar before serving.

Only a few cookies at a time will fit, even in a big pot, so frying takes time.  It is best to have company in the kitchen, ready with lots of good talk to keep you amused.  And there are always the warm cookies to eat along the way as a reward.  You can also dredge the cookies in granulated sugar, crystal sugar, or even a mix of powdered sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder.

This recipe yields 6 dozen.

       Butternut Squash Ravioli, Sage Butter, Bittersweet Chocolat

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  to medium butternut squash - -- (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  dark molasses
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Ravioli dough or 3/4 pound sheet pasta
                        purchased from local Italian delicatessen
                        Flour -- for dusting board
  4        tablespoons  sweet butter
  8                     fresh sage leaves
  2             ounces  Parmesan -- for grating
  2             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- for grating

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cut squash in 1/2 and scrape out seeds.  Spread 1 tablespoon molasses in the cavity.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place cut-side down on a roasting pan.  Cook in the oven until very soft, about 1 hour.  (See Chef's Notes.)

Let cool to room temperature and scoop out flesh into the work bowl of a food processor.

Puree squash until smooth, then spread on a baking sheet and return to the 375 degree oven to dry, about 10 minutes.  The consistency will be like mashed potatoes.  Scrape into a large mixing bowl.

Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until it begins to brown.  Immediately remove from heat and add remaining 1 tablespoon molasses and all the vinegar.  Add to squash with mascarpone, Parmesan, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and mix well.  The recipe can be made ahead to this point (makes 2 cups filling).  Cover well and refrigerate 4 hours or up to 2 days.

To fill the raviolis:  Lay out a sheet of pasta dough on a lightly floured board.  Cut into circles with a 3 1/2-inch pastry cutter.  Put 1 tablespoon squash filling in the center of 1/2 the rounds using either a pastry bag or a small spoon.  Leave a 1/2-inch border all around the filling.  Moisten borders with water and top with remaining rounds of dough.  Press all the air out and seal firmly by pressing all around with fingertips.  Lay raviolis out to dry on a lightly floured board or baking sheet and lightly flour the tops.  Repeat until you run out of dough and/or filling.  To cook, boil in lightly salted water until tender, about 3 minutes.  Reserve 2 ounces of the cooking water.

Uncooked, filled raviolis may be used immediately or frozen for 2 months.  Lay them out on sheet pans and place in freezer until frozen.  Transfer to plastic bag.

For the Sage Brown Butter:  While raviolis are cooking, in a large saute pan, melt the butter with the sage and a pinch of salt until it foams and becomes light brown.  Reserve.

On medium heat toss the cooked raviolis in the sage butter then transfer to a serving platter or dishes.  Add 2 ounces of the cooking water to the pan and swirl with any residual butter.  Spoon the butter sauce over the raviolis, then finish with a generous grating of Parmesan and bittersweet chocolate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Chef's Notes:  While I prefer the flavor that oven roasting gives the squash, you can microwave the butternut squash as well for about 30 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave.  You will still need to dry the puree in the oven as in the recipe.

For the Sage Brown Butter:  While raviolis are cooking, in a large saute pan, melt the butter with the sage and a pinch of salt until it foams and becomes light brown.  Reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On medium heat toss the cooked raviolis in the sage butter then transfer to a serving platter or dishes.  Add 2 ounces of the cooking water to the pan and swirl with any residual butter.  Spoon the butter sauce over the raviolis, then finish with a generous grating of Parmesan and bittersweet chocolate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Chef&apos;s Notes:  While I prefer the flavor that oven roasting gives the squash, you can microwave the butternut squash as well for about 30 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave.  You will still need to dry the puree in the oven as in the recipe.

  1                jar  pickled onions - (7 1/2 oz)
  1                jar  marinated artichoke hearts - (6 1/2 oz) -- drained
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                can  imported olive oil packed tuna - (7 oz) -- drained
  1                     tin anchovies with capers - (2 oz) -- drained
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  ketchup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  prepared horseradish
     3/4           cup  canned tomato sauce
     1/4           cup  tarragon vinegar -- plus
                        more for jars
  1 1/2      teaspoons  brown sugar
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  6        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Cayenne pepper
                        Sea salt -- preferably gray salt

Place all of the prepared and drained vegetables in separate bowls and reserve their juices.

In a large saucepan, combine ketchup, Worcestershire, horseradish, tomato sauce, tarragon vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, lemon juice, and cayenne.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Season, to taste, with salt.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it generously.  Blanch the cauliflower for about 2 minutes; it should still be crisp.  With a skimmer, transfer the florets to a tray to cool quickly.  Repeat with the carrots and then with the celery, cooking them just long enough to remove their raw taste; they will be cooked more later.  Add the white wine vinegar to the water and blanch the mushrooms for 1 minute (the vinegar will keep the mushrooms white).  Drain and spread the mushrooms on a tray to cool quickly.

Add the cauliflower, carrots, celery, and mushrooms to the sauce.  Add the juices from the canned and jarred vegetables.  Add the pepperoncini, olives, pickles, onions, and artichoke hearts and toss well.

In sterilized canning jars, place 1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar (this will guarantee freshness).  Load the sauced vegetables into the jar, using a wide-mouthed funnel to avoid a mess.

In one of the large pans that you have used, add olive oil, tuna, and anchovies and mix well.  Top each jar with some of the tuna mixture.  Cover and refrigerate, or allow to cool on the counter before serving.  This will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars:
   Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.

Sterilizing Tips:
   Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.

To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.

Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.

As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.

After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     yellow onions -- minced
  1              pinch  grey salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme leaves -- (optional)
                        Champagne vinegar* -- (see Chef's Tip)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a dry saute pan on the stove over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, tilt the pan and add the extra-virgin olive oil.  Add the onions, grey salt, and a twist of pepper.  Lower the heat to medium and saute, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the onions are caramelized.

Add 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme, if using, at end of cooking.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender**.  Cover the blender tightly.  Place a towel over the top of the blender and hold down.  Pureeing hot liquids can be dangerous as they can burst from the blender and scald you.  Puree the onions until smooth, adding a little water if the sauce is too thick.

Whatever the finished volume is of onions, add 25 percent Champagne vinegar and puree until smooth.  Caramelized Onion sauce can be stored in refrigerator up to a month.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

* Chef's Tip:  you can replace vinegar with lemon juice.

** When blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves

Lay out the chicken, spreading out the parts as much as possible.  Cover generously with 3 tablespoons of the fennel spice, rubbing it into the skin.  Place a large pot over medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add 6 tablespoons of the oil and heat to almost smoking.  Add the chicken and brown on all sides, about 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Add the celery, carrot, onion and bay leaves and sautÈ for a few minutes.  Add 4 cups of water to the pot, or enough to cover the chicken.  Bring to a gentle simmer and cook just until the chicken is almost fully cooked, about 40 minutes.  Turn off the heat and cover and let cool.  When pan has cooled, place in the fridge overnight.

Lift out the cooled chicken and strain the stock, discarding the solids.  Refrigerate or freeze the chicken stock for another use.

Remove the skin and bones from the chicken.  Shred the meat by hand into rough bite-size pieces.

In a large bowl, combine the shredded chicken, celery heart, red onion, 6 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons Fennel Spice Rub, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Add more oil, lemon juice, or Fennel Spice Rub, if desired.  Add the basil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (abt 2 to 3 lbs ea)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     fresh rosemary sprigs - (to 2)
  1 1/2                 lemons -- cut into chunks
                        === SEASONED SALT ===
  2        tablespoons  very finely-minced lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  sea salt -- preferablyy gray
                        salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 450 degrees if you have no convection fan, or to 425 degrees if you have a convection fan.

Rinse the chickens inside and out and dry well.

Make the salt:  In a bowl, combine the lemon zest, rosemary, salt, and pepper, mixing well.  Rub the chicken all over with the olive oil, and then rub with 3 tablespoons of the seasoned salt.  (Reserve the remaining salt for another use.)  Tuck the rosemary sprigs and lemon chunks into the chicken cavity.  You don't need to truss the chicken.

Place the bird on a rack in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature by 75 degrees and continue roasting until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a skewer, about 50 to 55 minutes longer.  Transfer the chicken to a platter and let rest for at least 10 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large saute pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add cinnamon, stir to combine, and simmer for about 3 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh strainer lined with a coffee filter into a sterilized airtight jar or bottle.  Store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 month.

This recipe yields 1 1/3 cups.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars:
   Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.

Sterilizing Tips:
   Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.

To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.

Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.

As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.

After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  fine-grind polenta
  1                cup  grated Asiago cheese
     1/3           cup  finely-sliced scallion greens
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  4                     extra large eggs -- whisked
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- melted, plus
                        more to cover if not serving immediately
     1/2           cup  Damn Hot Peppers -- (listed below)
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
                        === DAMN HOT PEPPERS ALLA PADELLA ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  green bell peppers -- halved, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  2                     jalapeÒos -- cut 1/8" slices
  2          teaspoons  sea salt -- preferably gray
                        salt, more if needed
  1                cup  fresh tomato puree
                        = (peel, seed, and puree 1 lb ripe
                        tomatoes in a food processor)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Generously butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish; set aside.  In a large bowl, stir the flour, polenta, cheese, scallions, sugar, baking powder, baking, soda and salt.  In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter.  Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula just until blended; do not over-mix.

Add 3/4 cup Damn Hot Peppers and then stir in hot sauce, to taste.  Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and level it with a rubber spatula.  Bake until the bread is golden brown and firm to the touch, about 35 minutes.  Cool briefly and then cut into squares and serve warm.  If not serving immediately, cover with more melted butter to keep moist overnight.

For the Damn Hot Peppers Alla Padella:  In a non-reactive saucepan, heat the olive oil.  When the oil is hot add the bell peppers, jalapeÒos and sea salt.  Cook over medium-high heat for about 15 minutes or until the peppers are partially tender.  Stir the bottom from time to time, adjusting the heat as necessary so that they don't brown.  There will still be some liquid left in the pot.

Add the tomatoes, lower the heat to a simmer and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, to reduce the tomato juice and finish cooking the peppers.  Add additional salt, if needed.  Add to batter as directed.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                             Fennel Spice Rub

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fennel seeds
  3        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  white peppercorns
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt

Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat.  Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly.  When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool.  They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades.

Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt.  Blend to a fine powder, shaking the blender occasionally to redistribute the seeds.  Store in a tightly sealed glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze.

This recipe yields about 1 1/4 cups.

Comments:  This is my favorite spice mixture.  There is almost nothing it doesn't taste good on or in.  Use it to make spice-encrusted pork ribs, chops, or tenderloin; veal chops; chicken breasts; duck; beef; liver; or eggplant; or add a teaspoon to lentil soup.  If you don't have time to make it, we do it for you, with our Fennel Spice Rub

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    jumbo prawns or shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        = (abt 1/2 lb total)
  1         tablespoon  Fennel Spice Rub -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                     blood orange
     1/2         large  grapefruit
  2                     naval or other large oranges
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     large bunch watercress

Sprinkle the fennel spice evenly over the flesh side of the prawns and let sit, covered and refrigerated, overnight.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet with even curved edge over medium-high heat until hot.  Lay the prawns, flesh down, against the curved sides of the pan, tails up and heads toward the center of the pan.  Press them down with spatula or rest a slightly smaller pan on top of the prawns as a weight, so they cook evenly and rapidly.  This will give them a gently curled shape.  Cook until they begin to turn pink around the edges, about 2 minutes.  Place the pan in the oven until the prawns are evenly pink, about 2 minutes longer.

Cut the skin and white pith off all the citrus fruits and segment the fruits over a bowl to catch the segments and juices.  Season with the salt and pepper and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Toss well, taste for balance and reserve.

To serve, place 1/4 of the watercress on 4 plates.  Toss the citrus mixture again and spoon around and over the watercresss, moistening with juices.  Arrange 3 prawns around each salad, standing them in a circle, tails up, and serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and toss again.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the vegetables are deeply caramelized, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring them occasionally so they cook evenly.  Serve immediately.

                             Fresh Mozzarella

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            gallons  water
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  1              pound  fresh mozzarella curd

In a large stock pot add the water and enough kosher salt until it tastes like saltwater.  Bring the water to a simmer and remove from heat.

While waiting for water to boil, the mozzarella curd needs to be shaved with a sharp knife into thin layers and set aside in a large bowl.

When water is ready, ladle over the shaved curd, just enough to cover.  Allow curd to warm before you begin forming your mozzarella.  Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the curd begins to pull (you should have a string like effect).  Work quickly with the curd to achieve a consistent silken texture.  Hold the cheese in the bowl with wooden spoon and pour off excess water.  Take the cheese in your hands and begin to fold under itself creating a round shape of desired size.  Pinch between your thumb and index finger, place fresh mozzarella in a bowl of cool water, continue this process until all the fresh mozzarella is formed.

This recipe yields 1 pound.

                   Fritto Misto With Two Mustard Sauce

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  honey mustard
     1/3           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  Champagne vinegar
  2          teaspoons  black or yellow mustard seeds -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  minced shallots
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        === BATTER ===
  1                cup  uncooked Arborio rice
  1                cup  semolina
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FRITTO MISTO ===
  1              pound  cleaned calamari (not giant squid)
  2               cups  assorted mushrooms of your choice -- cleaned, trimmed,
                        and sliced if large
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/8" thick slices
  1                     lemon (discard ends) -- very thinly sliced
                        Buttermilk -- for moistening
                        Peanut or canola oil -- for deep-frying

For the Sauce:  Whisk together mustards, vinegar, mustard seeds, and shallots.  Add salt, to taste.

For the Batter:  Grind the rice in a blender until very fine.  In a bowl, stir together the ground rice, semolina, flour, salt, and pepper.

For the Fritto Misto:  Heat several inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep fryer or a wide, deep, heavy pot.  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Slit the calamari bodies open so they lie flat.  Place calamari (bodies and tentacles), mushrooms, fennel, and lemon in separate bowls.  Toss each with enough buttermilk to moisten them.  Dip the calamari generously in the rice batter, using enough to fully coat.

Working in batches (it's important not to overcrowd the pot), fry until golden brown and crisp, and then transfer to a tray lined with paper towels.  Season immediately with salt.  Transfer to a low oven to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining calamari.

Coat and fry the mushrooms, fennel, and lemon slices in the same way, working in batches and transferring them to the low oven as they are done.

Put a generous pool of mustard sauce on each plate, then top with an assortment of fried squid, mushrooms, fennel, and lemon.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                            Green Eggs And Ham

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         quarts  water - (about)
                        Salt -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  white wine vinegar
  2                     eggs -- room temperature
  2             slices  country-style bread -- each 1/2" thick
  2                     thin slices prosciutto
  4          teaspoons  Chive Oil -- (listed below)
                        Freshly ground black pepper
                        === CHIVE OIL ===
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped fresh chives
  1                cup  olive oil

Preheat a broiler or a lightly oiled stove-top grill pan.

Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Salt the water, add the vinegar, and then lower the heat so the water barely bubbles.  One at a time, break the eggs into a custard cup or small bowl, and then pour into the water, trying not to break the yolks.  With a slotted spoon, gently lift and shape the whites around the egg yolks until glazed but still liquid, about 2 1/2 minutes longer.

While the eggs poach, toast the bread slices on both sides.  Put a slice of toast on each of 2 plates.  Immediately top with the prosciutto so that it softens from the heat of the toast.  Lift the poached eggs out of the water with a slotted spoon, letting excess water drip off, and then place an egg on each toast.  Drizzle each toast with 2 teaspoons chive oil and then grind a little black pepper over each.  Serve immediately.

For the Chive Oil:  Place chives and olive oil in a blender and puree.  Strain through a fine-mesh strainer.  Pour through a funnel into a bottle for storage.  Cover and refrigerate.  Use within 2 weeks.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 2 servings.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Preheat a broiler or a lightly oiled stove-top grill pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Salt the water, add the vinegar, and then lower the heat so the water barely bubbles.  One at a time, break the eggs into a custard cup or small bowl, and then pour into the water, trying not to break the yolks.  With a slotted spoon, gently lift and shape the whites around the egg yolks until glazed but still liquid, about 2 1/2 minutes longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the eggs poach, toast the bread slices on both sides.  Put a slice of toast on each of 2 plates.  Immediately top with the prosciutto so that it softens from the heat of the toast.  Lift the poached eggs out of the water with a slotted spoon, letting excess water drip off, and then place an egg on each toast.  Drizzle each toast with 2 teaspoons chive oil and then grind a little black pepper over each.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Chive Oil:  Place chives and olive oil in a blender and puree.  Strain through a fine-mesh strainer.  Pour through a funnel into a bottle for storage.  Cover and refrigerate.  Use within 2 weeks.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  portobello mushrooms
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BROKEN VINAIGRETTE ===
  5              large  vine-ripened tomatoes
                        = (or 1 (12-oz) can tomatoes)
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CORN SALAD ===
  6              large  corn ears -- shucked
  2               cups  shelled lima beans, fava beans, or
                        other fresh shelling beans
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  4             slices  bacon - (2 tbspns) -- cooked until very
                        crisp, well drained, and minced
  2        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === FISH ===
  4                     halibut fillets - (abt 5 oz ea)
                        = (or other firm-fleshed meaty fish such
                        as swordfish)

Broken Vinaigrette:  Core the tomatoes, cut into pieces, and place in a blender.  Blend until pureed.  Strain through a sieve into a bowl.  You should have about 2 1/2 cups puree.  If fresh tomatoes are not available use canned.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a non-reactive medium saucepan until hot.  Add the garlic and saute briefly until light brown.  Add the tomato puree and bring to a boil.  Simmer gently about 5 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.  Discard the solids.  Rinse out the saucepan, return the tomato juice to the pan, and bring to a boil.  Simmer and strain twice more until the tomato juice is as thick as heavy cream, about 15 minutes total cooking time.  Be sure to lower the heat as the mixture thickens to prevent scorching.  You should have about 1/4 cup of very smooth tomato juice.  Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and taste for salt and pepper.

Pour 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into a small, clean glass bottle with a stopper and swirl to coat the inside.  Coat the glass bottle with olive oil and the funnel before straining tomatoes so they don't stick.  Strain the tomato juice into the bottle.  Let it cool to room temperature.  Add olive oil ñ mixture should be half olive oil and half tomato.  Do not shake or mix!

Corn and Fava Bean Salad:  Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.  Blanche the corn and cook just until tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove and set aside.  Cook the beans in the same water just until tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  If using favas, peel them.  When the corn is cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cobs.  Toss together in a bowl.

Marinade for Corn and Fava Bean Salad:  In a clean jar with a lid, shake together minced tarragon, 2 tablespoons of the bacon, and 25 percent of Champagne vinegar and 75 percent olive oil.  Pour enough of the dressing onto the corn and beans to coat, toss well, and taste for seasoning.  Adjust with salt, pepper, and more dressing as necessary.  Set aside to marinate for about 15 minutes.

Fish:  Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper.  Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Put presentation side of the fish (non-skin side) in pan first as it gets the best caramelization.  Cook until brown on the first side, about 3 minutes.  When you see it getting opague around the edges, give it another minute and flip sides.  Cook another minute on other side.  Remove from pan and place on cookie sheet for a bit while you enjoy your appetizer with company.  Just before you're ready to serve it, put it in a preheated 450 degree oven for about 30 seconds.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Broken Vinaigrette:  Core the tomatoes, cut into pieces, and place in a blender.  Blend until pureed.  Strain through a sieve into a bowl.  You should have about 2 1/2 cups puree.  If fresh tomatoes are not available use canned.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a non-reactive medium saucepan until hot.  Add the garlic and saute briefly until light brown.  Add the tomato puree and bring to a boil.  Simmer gently about 5 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.  Discard the solids.  Rinse out the saucepan, return the tomato juice to the pan, and bring to a boil.  Simmer and strain twice more until the tomato juice is as thick as heavy cream, about 15 minutes total cooking time.  Be sure to lower the heat as the mixture thickens to prevent scorching.  You should have about 1/4 cup of very smooth tomato juice.  Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and taste for salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into a small, clean glass bottle with a stopper and swirl to coat the inside.  Coat the glass bottle with olive oil and the funnel before straining tomatoes so they don&apos;t stick.  Strain the tomato juice into the bottle.  Let it cool to room temperature.  Add olive oil ñ mixture should be half olive oil and half tomato.  Do not shake or mix!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Corn and Fava Bean Salad:  Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.  Blanche the corn and cook just until tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove and set aside.  Cook the beans in the same water just until tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  If using favas, peel them.  When the corn is cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cobs.  Toss together in a bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Marinade for Corn and Fava Bean Salad:  In a clean jar with a lid, shake together minced tarragon, 2 tablespoons of the bacon, and 25 percent of Champagne vinegar and 75 percent olive oil.  Pour enough of the dressing onto the corn and beans to coat, toss well, and taste for seasoning.  Adjust with salt, pepper, and more dressing as necessary.  Set aside to marinate for about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fish:  Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper.  Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Put presentation side of the fish (non-skin side) in pan first as it gets the best caramelization.  Cook until brown on the first side, about 3 minutes.  When you see it getting opague around the edges, give it another minute and flip sides.  Cook another minute on other side.  Remove from pan and place on cookie sheet for a bit while you enjoy your appetizer with company.  Just before you&apos;re ready to serve it, put it in a preheated 450 degree oven for about 30 seconds.

  3                     racks baby back pork ribs - (abt 5 lbs)
  1              quart  chicken stock

  3                     bay leaves
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     poblano chiles -- seeded, chopped
  3             medium  onions -- roughly cut
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3                     carrots -- roughly chopped
  2                     sliced and seeded jalapeÒo chile peppers
  2               cans  Roma tomatoes - (20 oz ea)
     3/4          cups  molasses
  1                cup  honey
  1                can  chipotle chiles in adobo sauce - (2 oz)
  1                     orange -- peeled, with
                        pith removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  lime juice

Spice Rub Mix:  Mix together all ingredients.

Ribs:  Preheat gas grill on low for 1/2 hour.  If using charcoal, let the coals burn to embers, also about 1/2 hour after lighting.

Cut the rib racks in half horizontally along the bone.  Season the ribs with a 1/2 of the spice rub mix.  In a large roasting pan, add chicken stock, beer, and the bay leaves.  Lower the ribs into the liquid.  Bring up to a simmer and poach the ribs for 15 minutes.

Take the ribs out of the liquid and season them with the other 1/2 of the spice rub on both sides.  While re-spicing the ribs, bring the liquid up to a boil over low heat to reduce.

Take the ribs outside to the grill.  The coals should be at the ember stage.  Gas grills stay on low.  Place ribs on the grill and cover to smoke for 2 hours.  While ribs are cooking, the sauce can be finished.

Add the olive oil to a large, preheated saute pan.  Add the poblanos and onions, and saute for 5 or 6 minutes, until carmelized.  Add the garlic, carrots, and jalapeÒos and saute another 3 minutes.  Add the Roma tomatoes and let it simmer 20 minutes.  Add the molasses, honey, and chipotle with adobo sauce.  Add the orange, then salt and pepper.  When the initial braising liquid has reduced by half, add this to the sauce mixture.  Let everything simmer for 20 minutes, or pop in a preheated 350 degrees oven for 20 minutes.

Blend sauce mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth.  Stir in red wine vinegar and lime juice.

Bring sauce to grill and brush on ribs for the last half hour of grilling.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

            Lemon Curd Over Biscotti Crumbs With Fresh Berries

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sugar
  9              large  egg yolks -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  fresh-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  rosemary leaves -- (*See Cook's Note)
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- in small pieces,
                        and at room temperature
  3               cups  mixed berries (2 pints -- different kinds)
  1 1/3           cups  crumbled biscotti

For the lemon curd: In the top of a double boiler, whisk the sugar and the egg yolks until sugar has dissolved and mixture is pale yellow, then whisk in lemon juice and zest. Set the bowl over simmering water and whisk constantly until mixture reaches 145 degrees F; it will visibly thicken but don't let it get too hot or the eggs will curdle. Remove the bowl from the heat and add the rosemary and butter a little at a time, whisking until each addition is incorporated and the curd becomes thick. Transfer to a bowl, cool and then refrigerate until well chilled.

Divide the berries among 6 decorative bowls or glasses. Top with a dollop of the lemon curd and sprinkle with biscotti crumbs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

* Cook's Note about rosemary:  Time of year matters.  If you use rosemary in the winter, use half as much because it's stronger ñ it grows slower and the taste is concentrated.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  ripe mangoes -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/2" dice - (abt 4 cups)
  1                cup  Simple Syrup -- (listed below)
  1              pinch  grey salt
                        A twist freshly-ground black pepper
                        Champagne vinegar* (see Chef's Tip)
                        === SIMPLE SYRUP ===
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  water
  1              pinch  grey salt
  2                     vanilla beans -- split in half

In a blender, puree the mangoes, sugar syrup, and salt.  Add vinegar and taste for balance.  Add more vinegar and thin with water, if necessary.  Strain through a fine strainer into a bowl.  Mango vinegar can be stored in refrigerator up to a month.

For the Simple Syrup:  To a saucepan add the sugar and water (equal parts).  Add a pinch of salt and the vanilla beans and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Discard the vanilla bean or save for another use.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

* Chef's Tip:  This is a ratio, not a recipe.  Whatever finished volume is, vinegar is 25 percent (Example: 2 cups mangoes takes 1/2 cup of vinegar)

Chef's Tip:  You can use any kind of fruit and vinegar ñ you can replace vinegar with lemon juice.  Herb vinegars don't work in this method.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  4               cups  fresh tomato puree
  1              large  fresh basil stem with leaves removed
  1           teaspoon  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  1              pinch  baking soda or sugar -- if needed

Heat the olive oil in a large non-reactive pot over moderate heat.  Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add the parsley and garlic and cook briefly to release their fragrance.  Add the tomatoes, basil and salt.  Simmer briskly until reduced to a sauce like consistency, stirring occasionally so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.  The timing will depend on the ripeness and meatiness of your tomatoes and the size of your pot.  If the sauce thickens too much before the flavors have developed, add a little water and continue cooking.

Taste and adjust the seasoning.  If the sauce tastes too acidic, add the baking soda and cook for 5 more minutes.  If it needs a touch of sweetness, add the sugar and cook for 5 more minutes.  Remove the basil stem before serving.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

          Michael Chiarello's Babyback Ribs With Espresso Sauce

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks baby back ribs
                        = (abt 4 to 6 ribs per person)
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Espresso Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Cut each rack of ribs in half along the bone so they can be easily stacked.  Lay them out on the parchment paper in which they were wrapped for easy cleanup.

Salt and pepper liberally on both sides and pat spices into the meat.  Make sure to over season the ribs, because part of the rub will inevitably come off in the pan.  On a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil, stack the ribs close together, about 3 layers high.  Place in the oven for 2 hours, shifting the bottom layer of ribs to the top every 30 minutes until they are tender and almost falling off the bone.

One half hour before serving, transfer ribs to a preheated grill (if using coals, make sure they have burnt down to an ember).  Brush ribs with Espresso Sauce and close grill.  Continue to turn and brush the ribs with sauce every 10 minutes, about 3 more times.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  whole small button mushrooms -- wiped clean
  3        tablespoons  butter
                        Gray sea salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley leaves

In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the mushrooms.  Do not move the mushrooms until they have caramelized on the bottom.  If you toss them too soon, they will release their liquid and begin to steam.  When the bottoms are caramelized, toss them and continue to cook for about 5 minutes.

Add the butter.  Cook and toss for 5 minutes, until beautifully browned.

Season with salt and add the garlic.  Saute another 2 minutes, and add the thyme, lemon juice, and white wine.  Cook to evaporate the liquid.

Toss in the parsley and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  nonfat dry milk
     1/4           cup  toasted wheat germ
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  water
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
                        more for garnish
  3            bunches  mint
  1             bottle  Southern whisky
  1                     egg white
                        Mint or lavender sprigs -- for garnish

Make a mint flavored simple syrup by boiling water and sugar with two bunches of roughly torn and bruised mint in large sauce pot.  Boil just until the sugar dissolves completely.  Cool and strain the mint out of mixture.

Add bottle of whisky to the infusion.  Stuff the empty whisky bottle with last bunch of fresh mint leaves and fill with the simple syrup/whiskey mixture.

Cap and put in freezer overnight.  It will freeze to a slushy consistency for serving.

Glasses:  Dip the rim of each glass in egg white, then in sugar for a frosted appearance and chill.  Fill with mint julep mixture straight from the frozen bottle and garnish with a mint or lavender sprig.

This recipe yields 1 pitcher or bottle.

Caution:  Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.  To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.

             Mixed Green Salad With Whole Citrus Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons
     1/2                navel orange or 1 small orange
  1                     shallot
  1 1/2           cups  pure olive oil
  1           teaspoon  gray sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8               cups  mixed young green lettuces
                        Cocoa Nibs
                        = (available at specialty and gourmet
                        food stores)

Juice the lemons, orange, and shallot in a juice extractor.  Put the juices in a bowl and whisk in the olive oil in a slow stream to form an emulsion.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Whisk again, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  You should have about 2 cups.

Just before serving, place the greens in a salad bowl, add about 1/2 cup vinaigrette, and toss well. Add more to taste and adjust the seasoning. Finish the salad with a sprinkling of cocoa nibs to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation for Blender:  Use 3 lemons, 2 small oranges, 1 shallot, 1 teaspoon gray salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 1/2 cups pure olive oil.

Cut off and discard the stem ends of 2 lemons and 1 orange.  Cut into quarters, cut out the core, and remove seed.  Place in a blender.  Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon and orange; add to the blender with the shallot, salt, and pepper.  Pulse and then blend the fruit until as smooth as possible.  With the machine running, add the olive oil in a thin, steady stream.  The vinaigrette will be thick like a mayonnaise.  If it is too thick, with the machine still on, thin with a little hot water.  Taste for seasoning.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  If the vinaigrette separates, return it to the blender and blend until smooth again.  (Makes about 3 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  anchovy fillets
     1/4      teaspoon  minced Calabrian chiles
                        = (or pinch red pepper flakes)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     eggs
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Butter -- as needed
  8             slices  country-style bread -- each 1/3" thick
     1/3         pound  whole-milk mozzarella cheese -- thinly sliced

Saute the minced garlic in olive oil in large saucepan.  Add the whole anchovy fillets and chiles or red pepper flakes, season with pepper, to taste.  Allow to saute in heat for about a minute, then remove from heat.  Pour into a bowl, set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk eggs, seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.  On another plate, place flour, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Heat a large nonstick skillet or a griddle over moderate heat.  When it is hot, lightly oil the griddle if it is not nonstick.  Butter 1 side of each bread slice, then put 4 slices, buttered-side down, on a work surface.

Spread 1 side of 4 bread slices with the anchovy mixture, dividing it evenly.  Top with the sliced rounds of mozzarella, dividing it evenly.  Top each with a second slice of bread, buttered-side up.

One at a time, dip the sandwiches in seasoned flour, coating well, then the egg bath.  Set them in the skillet or on the griddle.  Cook, turning once, until the bread is well browned on both sides and the cheese is molten, about 3 minutes per side.  Cut in halves or quarters and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dressing/Stuffing               Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     panettone - (abt 2.2 lbs)
  1              stick  sweet butter
  2            bunches  fresh sage -- leaves minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dried apricots -- julienned
     1/2           cup  dried sour cherries
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1 1/2           cups  minced yellow onion
  1                cup  minced celery or fennel
  1                cup  minced carrot
                        Up to 2 cups chicken stock
                        = (or turkey stock if you have it)
  2                     eggs -- optional, use if
                        you like a firmer stuffing

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the panettone into 3/4-inch squares and place in large bowl.  Melt half of the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and continue to cook until light brown, about 5 minutes.

Take off the heat and add half the sage.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour the sage butter over the bread and toss gently but swiftly.  Spread out on 2 cooking sheets and place in the oven until light brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and place back into the bowl.

Meanwhile, place the dried fruit in a large bowl; add boiling water to cover and then set aside for at least 10 minutes.  This will plump and soften the fruit for cooking.  Drain fruit once plumped.

Raise the oven temperature to 375 degrees.

Melt the remaining butter and add onion, celery, and carrot.  Saute on medium-low heat until soft.  Add dried fruit and remaining sage.  Toss into cooled croutons.  Gently toss and add chicken broth to moisten; add more broth if you like a softer stuffing.  Stir in beaten eggs now, if using.  Adjust salt and pepper, to your liking.  Turn out into an oven-proof casserole.

Bake uncovered until golden brown on top, about 40 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  premade pizza dough
  12              cups  torn romaine lettuce - (loosely packed) -- abt 2 heads
                        Favorite Caesar dressing -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- as needed
     1/2           cup  Roasted Garlic Paste -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  6        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
                        extra for garnish

Preheat a grill to high.

Put the lettuce in a bowl.  Pour the dressing over and toss well.

Divide the dough into 4 equal balls.  On a floured board, stretch and roll the dough into thin discs with a rolling pin.  The dough may also be stretched by hand, but rolling will give you a thinner crust.

Coat the rolled out dough with olive oil and place, oiled-side down, on a very hot grill.  This can be done indoors on a cast-iron stovetop grill pan that has been preheated over medium-medium high.  When you start to see bubbles on the surface of the dough, turn it over.  It should be slightly browned on the bottom.  Brush each round with a generous tablespoon of the garlic paste and sprinkle with the thyme.  Remove from the grill with tongs and top with the Caesar salad.  Grate parmesan cheese on top, fold in half, and eat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     apples
  2              heads  frisee lettuce - (to 3)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                     lemon -- juiced, plus
                        extra for sprinkling apples
  5        tablespoons  honey
                        Grey salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     bag pre-made pizza dough
                        = (from deli counter)
  4             ounces  blue cheese

2 hours before the party:  Core and slice the apples.  If you're not using immediately, squeeze lemon juice on them to prevent discoloration.

When your guests have arrived:  Wash and roughly tear the frisee into a salad bowl.  Add the apples.  Drizzle with olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon of the honey, salt and pepper.  Set aside

Divide the pizza dough into 4 sections.  On a floured board, stretch and roll the dough into thin disks with a rolling pin.  The dough may also be stretched by hand, but rolling will give you a thinner crust.  Coat the flattened dough with olive oil and place onto a very hot, preheated outdoor grill.  (This can be done indoors on a cast-iron stovetop grill pan.  Set the burners to medium, medium-high and make sure to preheat the pan.)  When you see bubbles rise to the surface, flip the dough.  It should be slightly browned on the bottom.

Put 1 tablespoon of the honey and 1-ounce of blue cheese, to taste, on the top of the crust.  Close down your grill and wait for the cheese to melt.  When it is nice and gooey, take it off the grill and top with the cool salad and apples.  Repeat with remaining dough and ingredients.  Fold it over, eat and enjoy.

2 hours before the party:  Core and slice the apples.  If you&apos;re not using immediately, squeeze lemon juice on them to prevent discoloration.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When your guests have arrived:  Wash and roughly tear the frisee into a salad bowl.  Add the apples.  Drizzle with olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon of the honey, salt and pepper.  Set aside
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the pizza dough into 4 sections.  On a floured board, stretch and roll the dough into thin disks with a rolling pin.  The dough may also be stretched by hand, but rolling will give you a thinner crust.  Coat the flattened dough with olive oil and place onto a very hot, preheated outdoor grill.  (This can be done indoors on a cast-iron stovetop grill pan.  Set the burners to medium, medium-high and make sure to preheat the pan.)  When you see bubbles rise to the surface, flip the dough.  It should be slightly browned on the bottom.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put 1 tablespoon of the honey and 1-ounce of blue cheese, to taste, on the top of the crust.  Close down your grill and wait for the cheese to melt.  When it is nice and gooey, take it off the grill and top with the cool salad and apples.  Repeat with remaining dough and ingredients.  Fold it over, eat and enjoy.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  arugula
  3                     ripe tomatoes -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4             slices  country-style bread -- each 1/2" thick
                        Pancetta -- recipe follows
     1/2         pound  whole-milk mozzarella cheese -- cut 12 slices
                        Sea salt -- preferably gray salt
                        === PANCETTA ===
  1              pound  pancetta
                        Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
                        === BASIL MAYONNAISE ===
  16             large  fresh basil leaves
  1 1/2           cups  mayonnaise
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Before putting together sandwich, make a plate of arugula and sliced tomatoes and set aside with unsalted butter.

Butter 1 side of each bread slice, then put 4 slices, buttered-side down, on a work surface.  Top the bread slices with the pancetta, distributing it evenly.  Top each with a second slice of bread, buttered-side up.

Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan until hot.  Place the sandwiches in the skillet and top with a weight, such as another skillet.  Cook until nicely browned, 2 to 3 minutes, then turn the sandwiches and replace the weight.  Cook until the second side is well browned, about 2 minutes.

Transfer the sandwiches to a work surface and remove the top slice of bread from each sandwich.  Spread the underside of those slices with the basil mayonnaise.  Top the pancetta with the tomato slices, pepper to taste, and arugula leaves.  Replace the top slice of bread, cut the sandwiches in half, and serve immediately.

For the Pancetta:  Take the roll of pancetta, and dice into about 1-inch cubes.  Drizzle some olive oil into a saute pan on medium heat.  Add pancetta to heated oil and cook until crispy.  Pour the cooked cubes with fat, into a bowl and allow to cool.

For the Basil Mayonnaise:  Place basil leaves in blender and puree until almost fine.  Add mayonnaise to blender and season with freshly ground black pepper, to taste.  Puree together until smooth.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  small "creamer" potatoes - (abt 16)
                        = (preferably Yukon gold)
                        Peanut oil -- as needed
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped garlic

Put the potatoes in a large pot of cold, well salted water to cover.  Bring to a boil and cook until a knife slips in easily, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain the potatoes.  Place on a cookie sheet and refrigerate until cool.

When they are cool enough to handle, hold 1 between your hands as if you were clapping and press gently with the heel of 1 hand.  You want to smash the potato to about a 1/2-inch thickness while keeping it in 1 piece.  The skin will split, but the potato should not fall apart.  Repeat with the remaining potatoes.  You can prepare the potatoes to this point several hours ahead.

Pour 1/2-inch of peanut oil in the large skillet and heat over moderately-high heat.

Combine the parsley, garlic, and lemon zest in a serving bowl and set aside.

When the oil begins to smoke, carefully put the smashed potatoes in the oil and cook on both sides until crisp and well browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Season with salt and pepper.

Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over moderately-high heat.  Add the garlic and saute until lightly browned.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to the bowl with the parsley-lemon mixture.

When the potatoes are ready, add them to the garlic mixture and toss gently.  Serve immediately.  Save the leftover garlic oil and use it to dress a salad or vegetables the following day.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  blue cheese -- cut into cubes
  8                     prosciutto (thinly sliced, cut in half
                        lengthwise)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat grill.  You will need medium to high heat for grilling.  The key is to crisp the prosciutto quickly and leave the blue cheese just melted with the inner part of the fig cool in temperature.

Cut the figs in half and place a piece of blue cheese on each fig half.  Wrap the prosciutto around each fig half, covering the cheese.  The ends of the prosciutto should overlap.

Grill each piece until the prosciutto begins to color and crisp, about 2 minutes on each side.  Remove from grill, lightly drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and season with sea salt and pepper.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  6                     firm Bartlett pears
  1             bottle  red wine
  1                     vanilla bean -- whole
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  sugar
  2                     containers mascarpone cheese - (8 oz ea) -- softened
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1              pinch  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter

Peel pears and leave stem intact.  In a large saucepan, bring wine and an equal amount of cold water to a simmer.  Split vanilla bean lengthwise and add to wine and water mixture.  Add cinnamon sticks, bay leaves and sugar, to taste.  Add pears to liquid and simmer for about 20 minutes or until tender.  Cool pears in wine mixture to room temperature.  You can refrigerate them in the poaching liquid until you're ready to fill them.

Remove stems from pears and set stems aside.  Core pears with an apple corer, leaving pear whole.

Whisk together mascarpone cheese, heavy cream, pinch cinnamon and powdered sugar until smooth.  Transfer to a pastry bag, or if you do not have one, use wax paper tightly wrapped into a cone with the corner snipped off.  Pipe filling into cored pears and finish by putting the stems gently into the mascarpone filling on top of the pears.

Bring sauce up to a simmer and reduce by half.  Add butter to reduced sauce and stir until combined.  Spoon generously over pears.  Cool to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Roasted Garlic Paste

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  whole garlic heads
     1/2           cup  pure olive oil
                        Gray sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Peel the outermost layers of skin off the heads of garlic.  Cut off the top 1/3 of the heads to open the cloves.  Save the small pieces of garlic for another use (see Chef's Note).  Put the heads, cut-sides up, in a small baking dish and pour the olive oil over them.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cover tightly, place in the oven, and roast until about 3/4 cooked, about 45 minutes.  Uncover and return to the oven until the cloves begin to pop out of their skins and brown, about 15 minutes.  Let cool.

When cool enough to handle easily, squeeze the roasted garlic into a small bowl.  Press against the skins very well to get out all the sweet roasted garlic you can.  Add the oil from the baking dish and mix well until a paste forms.  Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Chef's Note:  It is hard to have too much roasted garlic around.  You can roast the little bits from the tips of the garlic heads.  Put them in a separate small baking container, such as an individual custard cup.  Season with salt and pepper, douse with olive oil, cover, and place in the oven to bake along with the whole garlic heads.  Depending on their size, they will be soft and browned in about 1/2 the time needed for the whole heads.  The little pieces make a good "cook's snack" while preparing dinner, or can be squeezed into tomato sauce or onto pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    plum (Roma) tomatoes -- halved lengthwise
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste

                        more for storing
  2        tablespoons  Herbes De Napa -- crushed, (see
                        recipe)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

Preheat the broiler.  Arrange the tomato halves cut-side up and close together on a baking sheet.  Season with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine the 6 tablespoons olive oil, the herbs, and the garlic.  Spoon a little over each tomato half, stirring the mixture as you go.

This recipe yields 24 tomatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  broccoli rabe
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Red wine vinegar -- to taste

Remove the stems from the broccoli rabe.  Shake and rinse the broccoli rabe in colander to remove the excess liquid, but the rabe doesn't have to be thoroughly dry.

Heat a large pot over high heat until very hot.  Add the olive oil.  When the oil is almost smoking, add the garlic and cook for a few seconds until it is light brown.  Add a couple of handfuls of rabe and toss with tongs, incorporating the garlic so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan.

Add the remaining rabe all at once, or in batches if your pot isn't large enough to hold it all at once.  Toss constantly so the rabe wilts evenly.  When the rabe is cooked, season with salt and pepper.  Continue cooking over high heat, tossing often until the excess liquid evaporates.

Turn the rabe out into a bowl and let it cool to room temperature, then season with wine vinegar.  Eat at room temperature or refrigerate up to 2 days and eat cold.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Simmer for 5 minutes and then add garlic and wine.

  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated Parmesan

To make the seasoned bread crumbs, heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Tilt the pan and then add the minced garlic and saute briefly until pale gold.  Add the bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper, and lower the heat to medium.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bread crumbs are toasted, about 3 minutes.  Pour into a small bowl and add the parsley, lemon zest, and Parmesan.  Toss well.  (The crumbs keep, tightly sealed and refrigerated, for several days.)

                          Sicilian Harvest Salad

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raisins
                        Boiling water -- as needed
  1                cup  halved large seedless grapes
  1         tablespoon  diced dried apricots (1/4" dice)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Fried Rosemary -- (see recipe)
     1/4         large  red onion -- cut small slivers
  1              large  lemon -- juiced
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  radicchio head - (abt 3/4 lb)
  2               cups  baby spinach - (loosely packed)
  12                    thin slices prosciutto -- grilled and cubed
                        = (or 1/4 pound sausage) -- optional
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- toasted

Put the raisins in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them to cover.  Let stand until plump and soft, about 10 minutes.  Drain.

Put the raisins, grapes, apricots, rosemary and onion in a large bowl.  Add the lemon juice and stir in the olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.

Separate the radicchio into leaves, saving the heart for another use.  Tear into bite size pieces and add to the dried fruit mixture along with the spinach.  Toss well.  Divide among 4 plates and top with the prosciutto, if using.  Scatter the pine nuts over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  With the addition of a grilled chicken breast, this unusual appetizer salad would be a great main course.  The fruit on its own makes a wonderful little "chutney" to serve alongside a piece of grilled chicken or swordfish or to scatter across the top of focaccia before baking.  The dried fruit adds richness, so don't leave it out.  In the autumn and winter you can use figs, apples, pears, or persimmons in place of the grapes, while in summer you can use plums, apricots and peaches.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  5        tablespoons  polenta
  5        tablespoons  semolina
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Fontina or Telme
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
                        extra for dusting

In a heavy saucepan, combine the stock and cream, and bring to a boil.  Add the nutmeg and salt.  Whisk in the polenta and semolina and cook over low heat for about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring often, until the grains are soft.  Fold in the cheeses.  Serve immediately or reserve.

To encourage polenta to come cleanly out of the pan, cook over medium heat.  Run a spatula or wooden spoon around the sides of the pan to clean off the polenta.  Do not stir, but wait and watch for a few seconds until a large bubble begins to form and pushes the polenta upward.  Pour immediately into a warm dish.

The polenta can be made ahead and reheated:  Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water or stock, cover the dish, and reheat in the microwave or over low heat.  Whisk well before serving.  Grate a dusting of Parmesan over the top just before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add walnuts and blanch for 30 seconds.  Drain and transfer nuts to a medium bowl.  While nuts are still hot and slightly wet, add confectioners' sugar and toss to coat nuts.  Stir and toss until all the sugar has melted into the nuts; if bits of un-melted sugar remain on the nuts, they will not fry properly.

Stir the nuts again before frying.  Using a large slotted spoon, transfer a few nuts to the hot oil, allowing the foam to subside before adding another spoonful.  (Otherwise, the oil could foam over and burn you.)  Fry in small batches until the nuts are medium brown, about 45 seconds; be careful not to overcook.  Scatter on an unlined baking sheet to cool slightly.

In a small bowl, stir together cayenne, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and pepper.

While the nuts are still warm, transfer them to a bowl and sprinkle evenly with about half of the spice mix.  Toss well to distribute the spices and then taste a nut.  Add more spice mix, to taste, and toss well after each addition.  When cool, pack in an airtight jar.  They will keep at room temperature for at least 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

Serving Size  : 7     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice
  1                cup  white wine
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  chicken or vegetable broth -- heated
  2               cups  chopped spinach
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                cup  small mozzarella cubes
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  2               cups  seasoned bread crumbs
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

In large, deep saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil.  Add the onions and saute for about 1 minute.  Add the garlic stir.  After another 5 minutes, add the rice and white wine and a pinch of salt stir and allow to cook down for about 5 to 10 minutes.

Add 2 (8-ounce) ladles of broth.  Allow to absorb into rice for about 10 minutes, stirring, then add another 2 (8-ounce ladles) of broth and allow that to absorb for about 10 minutes.  Season with freshly ground black pepper, to taste.

Add spinach to broth and rice and stir in with sweet butter.  Add 1 cup of the Parmigiano.  When all ingredients are hot and mixed, pour and spread onto a parchment lined cookie sheet to cool.  Once cool, cover with a layer of plastic wrap to avoid skin forming and refrigerate until completely cooled and firm.  Refrigerate overnight if necessary.

When completely cooled, cover rice and spinach with remaining 1/2 cup Parmigiano.  With hands, roll into 1 1/2-inch balls.  With fingers, make a small hole in the rice ball's center and insert 1 small cube of mozzarella, and cover with more rice.

Place flour, beaten eggs, and seasoned bread crumbs in separate bowls.  Coat each ball with flour, then with whisked egg, then with seasoned breadcrumbs.  Repeat with all rice balls and lay the coated balls on a cookie tray and refrigerate until ready to fry.

In a heavy large pan, heat vegetable oil to 350 degrees.  Fry the balls, in batches, until golden brown.  Remove each ball with a slotted spoon and place on parchment paper or paper towel lined cookie sheet to dry.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 7 servings.

                             Spring Pea Soup

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- lightly crushed
  1 1/2           cups  sliced leek -- white and pale
                        green parts only
     3/4           cup  diced celery
  2 1/4           cups  chicken stock -- mixed with
  2 1/4           cups  water
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4 1/2           cups  shelled English peas
                        = (abt 4 1/2 lbs unshelled)
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf
                        parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  powdered ascorbic acid
                        = (1 tablet vitamin C crushed)
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===
                        Creme fraiche
                        Basil oil
                        Finely-sliced fresh chives
                        Prosciutto bits

Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over moderate heat.  Add the garlic and let it sizzle for about 1 minute, then add the sliced white and pale green parts of the leek and celery.  Stir often while cooking until the vegetables soften, about 8 minutes.  Do not let them color.  Then pour the diluted stock into the saucepan and bring to a simmer.

Add the cream to the vegetable mixture and bring to a simmer.  Add the peas and return to a simmer.  Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peas are just tender, about 8 minutes.  Add the parsley and thyme and simmer for 1 minute longer, then remove from the heat.

Transfer in batches to a blender with the ascorbic acid and puree, adding more of the stock-water mixture as needed to thin the soup to a pleasing consistency.  Pour soup into a bowl set in an ice bath and stir until cooled (we want to cool it down as quickly as possible).  Serve soup with optional garnishes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Chef's Tip:  Ascorbic acid helps keep the green color in pureed herbs and vegetables.  If you have vitamin C tablets on hand, just crush one with a rolling pin and add it to the mixture in the blender.  Note that you'll need a blender to puree the soup.  A food processor doesn't make it smooth enough.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ground chuck
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh Mozzarella
                        Chili Paste, chili flakes or anything hot
  1                     loaf good crusty bread -- cut into 4 sections

Preheat the grill.  In a bowl, mix the meat.  Form 4 (3-ounce) patties by using a scoop.  Push them down and make little indentations in the middle to hold the flavors.  Place a chunk of mozzarella and drizzle some chili paste or chili flakes on top of the mozzarella.  Add a good twist of black pepper.  Take another 3-ounce scoop of meat, make it flat in your hand and place right on top of the other half.

Take your fingers and just seal the 2 patties up and refrigerate until you are ready to grill.

Meanwhile:  Split the pieces of bread, and pull out some of the soft center to make a hole for the burger.  Place the bread face down on the grill to toast.

Place the burger in the bread, and top with your favorite condiments.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ground chuck
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  1                     loaf good crusty bread -- cut into 4 sections

Preheat the grill.  In a bowl, mix the meat.  Form 4 (3-ounce patties) by using a scoop.  Push them down and make little indentations in the middle to hold the flavors.  Place a teaspoon of garlic paste in the middle of each patty and add a little chunk of blue cheese tucked right on top of the garlic paste.  Add a good twist of black pepper.  Take another 3 ounce scoop of meat, make it flat in your hand and place right on top of the other half.

Take your fingers and just seal the 2 patties up and refrigerate until you are ready to grill.

Meanwhile:  Split the pieces of bread, and pull out some of the soft center to make a hole for the burger.  Place the bread face down on the grill to toast.

Place the burger in the bread, and top with your favorite condiments.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  Roasted Garlic Paste -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- or more to taste
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2/3)

Cube the potatoes.  Then put the potatoes in a large saucepan with salted cold water and place in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day, add some more salt and then bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain well, place potato cubes in a food mill, and grind to remove skins.  Alternatively, smash the potatoes with a large fork or potato masher.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown.  Add the garlic paste and cook quickly.  Add the cream, season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and fold in potatoes with a wooden spoon or large whisk.  Add the remaining butter by tablespoons, stirring after each addition.  Stir in the extra-virgin olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

Categories    : Condiments                      Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fennel seeds
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  peppercorns
  1 1/2      teaspoons  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  pure California chili powder* - (1 oz)
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon

Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat.  When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly.  Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan.  Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool.

Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground.  If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes.  Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

* Chef's Tip: Taste your chili powder and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount.  California chiles are almost sweet, not hot.

  1              bunch  fresh basil leaves -- cleaned
  1               pint  bocconcini mozzarella pieces
                        === QUICK TOMATO SAUCE ===
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz)

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  sugar
  1                cup  water
  2                     vanilla beans -- minced
                        = (or 2 tbspns pure vanilla extract)
  1              pinch  salt
  1              sprig  fresh thyme -- leaves only

Put the sugar, water, vanilla beans, a pinch salt, and the thyme leaves in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat.  Lower heat to a simmer and cook about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Let cool.  Puree syrup in a blender until vanilla beans are thoroughly chopped into the syrup.  Strain through a fine strainer into a sterilized jar.  If using vanilla extract instead of beans, add extract after the sugar syrup has cooled and pour into a jar.  Seal tightly.

This recipe yields 4 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Keep this syrup on hand to add to iced tea and other cold drinks or for poaching fruit.  It does not need to be refrigerated.  The vanilla is minced to make sure all its flavor is extracted into the syrup.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars:
   Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.

Sterilizing Tips:
   Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.

To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.

Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.

As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.

After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1                cup  ground veal
     1/2           cup  ground pork
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  dry porcini mushrooms -- soaked in warm
                        water for 15 minutes and chopped -- liquid reserved
  2        tablespoons  porcini juice -- reserved from above
     3/4           cup  veal stock
     1/4           cup  canned or jarred marinara sauce
     1/3           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley leaves
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook gently to sweat for about 2 minutes.  Do not let the onions caramelize.  Add the garlic and rosemary and cook about 1 minute, or until garlic is lightly browned.

Add the veal and pork and cook, smashing the meat apart with a wooden spoon, to keep it from clumping together.  Cook for about 2 minutes and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Add the mushrooms and continue to cook about 4 minutes, evaporating any liquid and caramelizing the meat.

Add the porcini juice to the meat and cook for 1 minute to evaporate.  Add the veal stock and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the marinara and the wine.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the parsley.

Toss 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan into the sauce to help it bind.  Add some reserved pasta water, as necessary, if the sauce appears too dry.  Top with the remaining Parmesan.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  Fennel Spice Rub -- (see recipe)
  8             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  2                     lemons -- halved
  4              large  carrots -- halved lengthwise
  8                     celery stalks
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  butter

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Remove necks and giblets and put into a large saucepan.  Add onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and the chicken stock.  Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat and let simmer until reduced to about 2 cups.  Strain and reserve; this is the turkey stock that you will use for the gravy.

Wash the turkeys, inside and out, and dry well.  Coat inside and out with half of the olive oil.  Season each turkey on the outside generously with the spice rub, pressing it in to adhere.  Place 4 rosemary sprigs and 2 lemon halves inside the cavity of each turkey.

Arrange 4 of the halved carrots and 4 celery stalks on each of 2 half-sheet pans or baking sheets.  Position each turkey on top of the carrots and celery so that the turkey does not rest directly on the bottom of the pan.  Drizzle turkeys with remaining olive oil.

Roast until an instant-read thermometer (inserted deep into the thigh but away from the bone) reads 165 degrees and juices in the thigh run clear when pierced with a fork, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours; begin checking at 2 hours.  Remove from the pans and let rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Reserve pan juices for gravy.

While turkeys are resting, make the gravy.  In a medium heavy saucepan, cook flour and butter over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a blond roux is formed.  Add pan juices and then reserved turkey stock and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat and let simmer until thickened and ready to serve.

Carve turkey as desired and serve with gravy.

This recipe yields about 20 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Frittatas

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  garlic cloves
                        Olive oil -- for sauteing
  1             medium  zucchini
     1/2         bunch  basil
  8                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat the broiler.

Start by crushing some garlic and heating it in some olive oil in a medium nonstick saute pan on the stove.  While that is heating up, very thinly slice the zucchini on a mandoline.  When the oil and garlic are heated, tear some basil into the pan and add all the sliced zucchini.  Cook until the zucchini is tender, but not cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Blend eggs in a blender with a little bit of milk and some salt and pepper.  Blend on the highest speed.

Pour the egg mixture into saute pan and let it sit for 1 minute.  When there isn't much loose egg left in the pan, grate some Parmesan on top and place pan in the broiler for 1 minute.

Take pan out of broiler, let it cool and set in pan for 5 minutes.  When cool invert a plate on top of pan and turn over.  Slice and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
