  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAFFRON RISOTTO ===
  5               cups  chicken or beef stock - (to 6)
     1/8      teaspoon  ground saffron
  4        tablespoons  sweet butter
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg yolk -- room temperature
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- to taste
                        === RAGU ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  ground veal
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  tomato paste
  1              piece  Parmesan cheese rind - (6 oz)
  2                     carrots -- peeled, quartered
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Risotto:  In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the stock until almost a boil.  Turn the heat to very low and stir in the saffron.

In a 10- to 12-inch saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Immediately stir in the rice and cook over medium-high heat.  Using a wooden spoon, stir continuously until the rice is coated in the butter and begins to turn translucent, about 2 minutes.  Be careful not to let the rice burn.

Keeping the heat at medium-high, begin ladling the hot broth into the rice, about 2 ladlefuls at a time.  Constantly stir with the wooden spoon until the rice has almost absorbed all of the broth.  Continue adding the both bit by bit until the rice is al dente or tender, about 20 minutes.

Once the rice is cooked, season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and immediately add the egg yolk and the remaining tablespoon butter.  Stir to thoroughly combine and set aside to cool.

To make the Ragu:  In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, cook the olive oil, veal, and onion over high heat.  Stir often, and continue cooking until the veal loses its pink color.

Add the remaining ingredients through the 3 cups of chicken stock.  Turn the heat to medium-low and allow the ragu to simmer for about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, until quite thickened.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir well to combine, and remove the ragu from the heat.  Let the ragu cool, about 45 minutes.

When the ragu is cool to the touch, place a scant cup of rice into the palm of one hand and use the fingers of your other hand to form a cup-like mound of rice.  Place a generous tablespoon of the ragu into the rice cup, then gently fold the outer edges of the rice over to cover the ragu, completely enclosing it.  You should have a ball of stuffed rice and there should not be any ragu leaking out.  You may need to add a little more rice to help close the ball.  Set the arancine aside and use the remaining rice and the remaining ragu to make about 7 more balls.

Roll each finished ball carefully through the beaten egg whites, then dredge through the breadcrumbs.  Place the arancine on a tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

In the meantime, heat 4 inches of cooking oil in fryer or deep frying pan to 375 degrees.  When the oil has reached temperature and the arancine have had time to cool, carefully place 3 balls at a time into pan and fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring with tongs or kitchen spoon to keep them moving.  Drained cooked balls on paper towels and place on large platter.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 sevings.

  1                     red onion -- chopped 1/8" dice
  1              pinch  saffron
  2               cups  arborio rice
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  grated pecorino
  2                     eggs -- plus
  2                     eggs -- separated
                        === STUFFING ===
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  8             ounces  salted sardines -- heads removed,
                        rinsed and roughly chopped
  2             sprigs  mint
     1/4           cup  flour for dusting
     1/2           cup  breadcrumbs for coating
                        Extra-virgin olive oil for frying

To make the Rice:  In a 4- to 6-quart saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until just smoking.  Add half the chopped red onion and saffron, and cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes.  Add rice and chicken stock, and bring to boil, uncovered.  Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 25 minutes.

Spread rice out to cool on a large cookie sheet, about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick.  When rice is cool, mix with the Pecorino, 2 eggs, and 2 egg yolks, and set aside

To make the Stuffing:  In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, cook the remaining chopped onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until light golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Add the tomato sauce, chopped sardines, and mint, and cook 5 to 7 minutes until reduced by one third and quite thick.  Set aside and allow to cool.

To assemble:  Place the flour for dusting, egg whites, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls and lightly beat egg whites.  To form arancine, place 3 tablespoons rice mixture in palm of hand and make an indentation with the back of a spoon.  Spoon 2 tablespoons sardine mixture into indentation and form an open bowl out of the rice in your hand.  Cover filled portion with another tablespoon of rice mixture and using both hands, shape the rice into a ball.  Continue with remaining rice mixture and stuffing until done.

Roll each ball in flour, then egg whites, then breadcrumbs and refrigerate 1 hour, uncovered.

Heat 4 inches of cooking oil in fryer or deep frying pan to 375 degrees.  Carefully place 3 balls at a time into pan and fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring with tongs or kitchen spoon to keep them moving.  Drained cooked balls on paper towels and place on large platter and serve either warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE DOUGH ===
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
  6              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/3           cups  unsalted butter -- melted, then
                        brought back to room temperature
                        === PIE ===
     1/2        recipe  Pie Dough -- (listed above)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for coating pan,
                        and brushing the pie
                        Flour -- for coating pan
                        === FILLING ===
  10            medium  artichokes -- cleaned
                        = (or 2 cups frozen and thawed artichoke
                        hearts)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- freshly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped Italian parsley leaves
  2               cups  Bechamel Sauce - {Besciamella} -- (see recipe)

To make the Dough:  Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.  Add the eggs and vanilla, and mix together using he blades of 2 knives.  Incorporate the butter bit by bit.

Lightly coat your hands with a little extra flour.  Using your hands, knead he dough briefly, so that it just sticks together.  Be careful not to overwork the dough, or it will toughen.

This dough can also be made in a food processor, being careful not to over-process once the butter has been added.

Form the dough into 2 balls, cover each with plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 12 hours.  This dough can also be frozen for future use.

To make the Tart:  Clean the artichokes down to the "heart" and halve or quarter.  Put into a 12-inch saucepan with the olive oil and onion, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Saute until onions are caramelized and then barely cover with water.  Reduce heat to medium, cook for 15 minutes of until artichokes are very tender.

Drain the artichokes and onion, and transfer to a bowl.  Mix in the parsley and set aside.

Prepare the Bechamel Sauce.  Fold the artichokes into the sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Grease a 9-inch springform tart pan with olive oil and lightly coat with flour.

Roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a 10 1/2-inch circle that is 1/4-inch thick.  Fit the dough into the center of the pan, pressing evenly halfway up the sides.

Pour the filling into the pastry shell and smooth the top across evenly.

Take the small pieces of remaining dough and roll them into little ropes, about 1/3-inch thick.  Use these ropes to stripe the top of the artichoke filling in 5 or 6 rows about 1-inch apart.  Make sure to press the ends into the edge of the tart shell's dough.  Turn the tart a 1/4 turn and place the remaining ropes on top of the first layer, going the opposite direction.

Bake the tart on a baking sheet in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes, brushing crust with additional olive oil during the last 10 minutes of baking.

Remove the cooked tart and let it cool.  It's best served at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  3             medium  eggplants -- stem ends removed,
                        and cut 1/3"-thk lengthwise slices
                        === FRITTATA ===
  4              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped Italian parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a 12-inch frying pan, pour olive oil until it sits 1-inch deep.  Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it is hot, but not smoking.  Add the eggplant slices and fry, in batches, until lightly browned on each side.  Remove the eggplant slices to drain on paper towels.

To make the Frittata:  Whisk the eggs and the 1/3 cup Parmesan together in a bowl.  Add the parsley, and season the mixture, to taste, with the salt and pepper.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in an 8- to 10-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.  Pour in the egg mixture and cook, swirling the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the omelet sets and the bottom turns a light golden brown.

Invert the frittata over a clean plate and then return to the pan, top-side down, golden brown-side up.  Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until the bottom side is also golden brown.  Transfer the frittata to a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut into 1 1/2-inch strips.  Cut each strip in half, crosswise.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place a frittata strip in the center of each eggplant piece.  A few of the longer eggplant slices will need 2 shorter strips of frittata.  Roll the stuffed eggplant up from 1 end to the other and place, seam-side down, in a lightly greased baking pan.  The rolls should be placed side by side, somewhat tightly, together.

Spoon the Basic Tomato Sauce over the eggplant rolls and drizzle lightly with olive oil.  Sprinkle lightly with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan.  Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.  Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     quails
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves -- chopped with salt
  2                     onions
  4                     skewers
  8                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for greasing the baking pan

Preheat the broiler.

Clean out the quails, removing all the gizzards.  Divide the rosemary into 4 equal parts and pat 1 part rosemary into the inner cavity of each bird.  Slice the onions lengthwise so that each onion opens into large leaves.

If using wooden skewers, soak them in warm water for 30 minutes before skewering the ingredients.  Using 1 skewer per bird, skewer an onion leaf, 1 bay leaf, and 1 quail, taking care to skewer the bird directly through its inner cavity.  Add a second bay leaf and a second onion leaf.  Repeat with the remaining skewers.

Place the 4 quail skewers side by side in a well-greased baking pan.  Sprinkle the birds with salt and pepper and drizzle with the 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Place birds on lower rack and broil about 10 minutes or until legs are well done and the rest is a medium doneness.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  1             medium  cauliflower head -- cut large florets
  1           teaspoon  saffron
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced

  1 1/2    tablespoons  pine nuts
  1 1/4         pounds  ziti
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino-Romano
  1                cup  bread crumbs

Bring the cauliflower water back to a boil and add the ziti.  Cook until parboiled, about half-done.  Drain well.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Pour the ziti into a large, deep, ovenproof casserole.  Stir in the cauliflower mixture and 1/2 of the cheese.  Sprinkle with the saffron water and mix gently.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.  Crumble the bread crumbs on top and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks lamb
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves - -- (to 4)
                        Salt -- as needed
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1             medium  red onion -- cut 1/4"-thk
                        half-moons
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3                     oranges -- zested, juiced
  3                     lemons -- zested, juiced
  3                     limes -- zested, juiced
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- leaves chopped fine

If preparing in conjunction with the Fire-Roasted Artichokes (see recipe), the barbecue should be lit and then artichokes started when this dish is begun.  If not, light the barbecue.

Clean and trim both racks of lamb and cut into 8 double chops.  Chop the rosemary with salt.  Rub the chops with the herbs and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil.  Set aside.

In a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, heat the 3 remaining tablespoons olive oil over high heat.  Before the oil begins to smoke, add the onion and cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes.  Add the sugar and continue cooking until a dark brown caramel begins to form.  Add the citrus juices, the zests, and simmer 5 minutes more.  Add the fruit segments and simmer 2 more minutes, and remove from the heat.

Grill the lamb chops over the hot part of the grill 5 to 7 minutes per each side for medium-rare.  Remove the artichokes from the grill and arrange on a platter.  Arrange the cooked lamb chops on the other end.  Brush the chops with marjaram leaves dipped in citrus sauce.  Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with Fire Roasted Artichokes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  freshly shucked beans of your choice
                        = (fava, limas, cannellini, etc)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for the baking pan
  1         tablespoon  minced Spanish onion
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/8           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Place the cleaned beans into a medium saucepan.  Add water to just cover and a generous pinch of salt.  Bring the water to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer and let simmer until the beans are tender, about 10 minutes.

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion, celery and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion and celery soften and turn a light golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Add the lightly browned vegetables to the pot of beans.  Bring the liquid back to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.  Let simmer for 20 minutes more, until the beans have softened and cracked open, yielding a dry mixture.

In a small saucepan over low heat, heat the milk and add the flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until the flour dissolves completely into the milk and the liquid is homogenous, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl and, using a whisk or fork, beat until homogenous.  Add the bean mixture, the Parmigiano, and the milk mixture.  Mix with a wooden spoon until well combined, about 3 minutes.

Lightly oil a 6-inch round baking pan.  Make sure you use a pan that can fit comfortably in another pan working as a hot water bath.  Pour the bean mixture into the pan and, using the back of a wooden spoon, level the top.  Cover the top of the pan tightly in aluminum foil.  Place the filled pan in the larger pan and fill the larger pan with hot water until it comes halfway up the sides of the filled pan.

Place in the oven and cook until the custard is cooked through the center but yields slightly when pressed, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion, celery and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion and celery soften and turn a light golden brown, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the lightly browned vegetables to the pot of beans.  Bring the liquid back to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.  Let simmer for 20 minutes more, until the beans have softened and cracked open, yielding a dry mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan over low heat, heat the milk and add the flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until the flour dissolves completely into the milk and the liquid is homogenous, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl and, using a whisk or fork, beat until homogenous.  Add the bean mixture, the Parmigiano, and the milk mixture.  Mix with a wooden spoon until well combined, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil a 6-inch round baking pan.  Make sure you use a pan that can fit comfortably in another pan working as a hot water bath.  Pour the bean mixture into the pan and, using the back of a wooden spoon, level the top.  Cover the top of the pan tightly in aluminum foil.  Place the filled pan in the larger pan and fill the larger pan with hot water until it comes halfway up the sides of the filled pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place in the oven and cook until the custard is cooked through the center but yields slightly when pressed, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried cannellini beans -- soaked overnight,
                        and drained
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     leek, white and light green parts only -- thinly sliced
  1                     carrot -- cut 1/4" dice
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/4" dice
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced, plus
  1              whole  garlic clove
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pound  cavolo nero (black cabbage) -- roughly chopped
     1/2         pound  white cabbage -- roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  water
  4             slices  Italian peasant bread, 1/2" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Place the presoaked cannellini beans in a medium stockpot.  Add water to just cover the beans and bring the water to a boil over high heat.  Lower the heat and let the beans simmer until tender, about 1 hour.

In a 12-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion, leek, carrot, celery, sliced garlic, and herbs.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the black and white cabbages and cook until the cabbage has softened and the flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.  Salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove the sprigs of rosemary and thyme and the bay leaf.  Add the tomato paste, and stir until the tomato paste is well distributed throughout the vegetable mixture.

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Add the vegetable mixture to the pot with beans and water and let simmer until the flavors are well blended, about 30 minutes more.  When the soup is close to being done, toast or grill the bread until both sides are browned.  Cut the remaining garlic clove in half, and rub the toasted bread with the cut end of the garlic.  Discard the garlic.

Serve the soup hot in 4 warmed bowls with the garlic bruschetta on the side.  Garnish with a sprinkling of Parmigiano, to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced, plus
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, whole
  2            bunches  cavolo nero (or kale) -- chopped 1" ribbons
  4             slices  country bread, 1" thick
     1/2         pound  pecorino toscano

Preheat the grill or broiler.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the 6 tablespoons of the olive oil and the garlic slices together over medium heat, until the garlic begins to soften.  Add the cavolo all at once, stirring to keep the garlic from settling at the bottom.  Cover the pan and allow the cabbage to cook until soft, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, grill or toast the bread.  Rub 1 side of each toasted bread slice with raw garlic.  Place 1 slice of bread in 4 shallow bowls and top each slice with a large spoonful of the cabbage mixture.  Drizzle each bruschetta with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and shave pecorino over each portion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Canned Sardine Fritters - {Fritelle Sarde}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  good-quality oil-packed sardines -- chopped
  2              large  eggs
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4         bunch  parsley leaves -- finely chopped,
                        plus extra for garnish
  1         tablespoon  chopped pepperonchini - (to 2)
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  grated caciocavallo cheese
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon halves

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the canned sardines, eggs, garlic, parsley, pepperonchini, bread crumbs and cheese.  Using a wooden spoon stir lightly, not to mash mixture.  Set fish mixture aside.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway full with the olive oil.  Heat over a medium flame until the temperature reaches 350 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the frying process.

Using a spoon, make fritters into semi-balls.  When the oil reaches temperature, gently drop the fish balls into the hot oil.  Be careful not to splatter the oil.  Fry each fritter to a golden brown, about 2 minutes.

Carefully remove the cooked fritters with a slotted spoon and reserve on a serving dish.  Repeat until all of the fish mixture has been used.  These fritters are best served hot with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRESPELLES ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                cup  whole milk
                        Olive oil -- for the pan
                        === CANNELLONI ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  1                     carrot -- cut 1/4" dice
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/4" dice
  1              pound  ground chicken
     1/2         pound  chicken livers -- roughly chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

Place the flour in a mixing bowl, add the eggs, and whisk them in.  Add the salt, then whisk in the milk, a little at a time until all the milk is incorporated.  Allow the batter to stand for 20 minutes.

Heat 2 crepe pans over medium heat, smear with oil, ladle in 2 ounces of batter and cook the crespelle, 2 at a time until all batter is used.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a 12-inch saute pan over a medium-high flame, heat the olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion, carrot and celery, and cook until soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Add the chicken meat, livers, and nutmeg.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Lower the heat to medium and let cook until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside to cool at room temperature.

When the meat mixture has cooled, add the eggs and 1/2 cup of Parmigiano.  Use a wooden spoon to mix until well combined.  Scoop 1 1/2 tablespoons of the meat mixture into the center of each crespella.  Roll the crespella into a tube along the long side and place in a lightly oiled baking dish, in a single layer, seal-side down.  Repeat with the remaining cannelloni, placing them side by side in the baking dish.

Ladle the Basic Tomato Sauce over the cannelloni.  Sprinkle the crespelle with the remaining Parmigiano and bake in the oven until the cannelloni are hot throughout and the cheese is hot and bubbling, about 30 minutes.  Serve immediately on warmed plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHELLS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  Marsala
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  sheep's milk ricotta
                        = (may substitute cow's milk)
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
     1/3           cup  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  4        tablespoons  grated orange zest -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/4           cup  tiny chocolate chips
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  2             quarts  canola oil -- for frying
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

To make the Shells:  Mix together the dry ingredients and cut in butter with 2 knives.  Add the Marsala and shape the dough into a ball.  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate.

Heat 2 quarts canola oil in 3 1/2-quart pot to 360 to 375 degrees.

To make the Filling:  In a mixing bowl, stir together the ricotta, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, orange zest, and chocolate chips.  Mix until well combined.  Spoon the filling into a pastry bag with an open tip, and place the bag in the refrigerator.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide into 4 equal pieces.  Using a rolling pin, roll 1 piece onto flat surface until it measures 1/16-inch thick.  Using a cookie cutter or a sharp knife, cut the dough into 4-inch circles.  Using a rolling pin, elongate the circles into ovals.

Wrap the ovals lengthwise around the metal cannoli tubes.  Using your fingertips, seal the edges shut with egg whites.  Use your fingers to flare the ends open.

Working in small batches, carefully lift the cannoli shells and place them in the hot oil.  Fry the shells until golden brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon or spatula, remove the finished shells to a plate lined with paper towels.  Drain on paper towels as they cook.  Allow to cool.

When the shells are cool enough to touch, carefully twist the molds away from shells.  Shells may be made 1 day in advance and rest unfilled and uncovered.  When ready to eat, stuff cannoli with ricotta cream, dust with powdered sugar and orange zest.

                        === RISOTTO ===
  4        tablespoons  sweet butter
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
  5               cups  chicken stock - (to 6)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish
                        === CHICKEN LIVERS ===
     3/4         pound  chicken livers
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  Marsala wine
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock

Make the Risotto:  In a 10- to 12-inch saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the onion and sweat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the rice and cook over medium-high heat.  Using a wooden spoon, stir continuously until the rice is coated in the butter and begins to turn translucent, about 2 minutes.  Be careful not to let the rice burn.

Keeping the heat at medium-high, begin ladling the hot broth into the rice, about 2 ladlefuls at a time.  Constantly stir with the wooden spoon until the rice has almost absorbed all of the broth.  Continue adding the broth bit by bit until the rice is al dente or tender, about 20 minutes.

Once the rice is cooked, season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and immediately add the remaining tablespoon butter and 3/4 cup Parmigiano.  Stir to thoroughly combine and keep warm until ready to serve.

Dredge the chicken liver pieces through the flour until well coated.  Shake to remove any excess flour and set aside.

In a 12-inch saucepan, heat the olive oil over a medium-hot flame.  Add the chicken livers and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Pour the wine over the chicken livers and let cook until the wine evaporates, about another 4 to 5 minutes.

Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Add the chicken stock.  Keep cooking over a medium flame until the chicken livers are completely cooked, about 3 minutes more.  Let the broth bubble so that the sauce thickens; there should almost be no sauce in the pan, just a few droplets to keep the livers moist.

Serve the chicken livers immediately, in the center of a serving platter, accompanied by the hot risotto.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VIN COTTO ===
  4 1/2           cups  red wine
  12            ounces  honey - (scant)
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  3                     cloves
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cleaned, giblets
                        removed, and cut into 8 portions
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1              large  onion -- cut large dice
  2                     carrots -- peeled, diced
     1/2           cup  green olives (Sicilian variety) -- pitted, chopped
  3        tablespoons  raisins
  1         tablespoon  capers -- rinsed, drained
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- toasted
  3        tablespoons  almonds -- skinned, toasted
  1 1/2           cups  Vin Cotto -- (listed above)
  1                cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot red chili flakes -- for garnish
                        Chopped Italian parsley -- for garnish

To make the Vin Cotto:  Combine all the ingredients in heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat and then simmer, stirring occasionally to ensure that the honey does not burn, until the wine is reduced to 1/4 of its original amount, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Remove the cinnamon sticks before using.

To make the Chicken:  Remove the giblets, clean and pat dry the chicken.  Cut the chicken into 8 pieces, leaving the bones intact.

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the chicken pieces, skin-side down, and brown on both sides over high heat, about 4 minutes per side, season with salt.  When the chicken is brown, add onion and carrot, caramelize and toss.  Add the olives, raisins, capers, pine nuts, and almonds, deglaze with 1 cup of the vin cotto, reducing by 1/2.

Add the remaining 1/2 cup vin cotto and turn the heat to high, so that the wine comes to a boil.  In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and the sugar.  Add to the pan and cook over high heat until all the wine and vinegar has evaporated.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and serve hot, garnished with chili flakes, parsley, extra-virgin olive oil and cracked black pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the Vin Cotto:  Combine all the ingredients in heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat and then simmer, stirring occasionally to ensure that the honey does not burn, until the wine is reduced to 1/4 of its original amount, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Remove the cinnamon sticks before using.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Chicken:  Remove the giblets, clean and pat dry the chicken.  Cut the chicken into 8 pieces, leaving the bones intact.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the chicken pieces, skin-side down, and brown on both sides over high heat, about 4 minutes per side, season with salt.  When the chicken is brown, add onion and carrot, caramelize and toss.  Add the olives, raisins, capers, pine nuts, and almonds, deglaze with 1 cup of the vin cotto, reducing by 1/2.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining 1/2 cup vin cotto and turn the heat to high, so that the wine comes to a boil.  In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and the sugar.  Add to the pan and cook over high heat until all the wine and vinegar has evaporated.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and serve hot, garnished with chili flakes, parsley, extra-virgin olive oil and cracked black pepper.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chickpea flour
  2               cups  water
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley leaves -- finely chopped,
                        plus more garnishing
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  Caciocavallo cheese
                        Potato Fritters - {Cazilli} -- (see recipe)

In a 2-quart saucepan, dissolve the chickpea flour in 2 cups water.  Stir in chopped parsley, salt, extra-virgin olive oil, sliced garlic clove and 2 eggs.  Place the saucepan over medium heat and continue mixing until ingredients combine to form a thick paste.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow the dough to cool.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Using your palms, shape the chickpea flour dough into oval-shaped fritters, about 2 inches in length.

Working in batches of 6, fry the fritters until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop spoonfuls of the fritters into the oil, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished fritters to a serving plate. Repeat process until all the panelle are cooked.

Garnish with parsley and cheese.  Serve warm accompanied by cazilli.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  blueberries
  1               pint  blackberries
  1               pint  raspberries
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  8        tablespoons  cold sweet butter -- cut 1/2" dice plus
  1         tablespoon  cold sweet butter
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
     1/4           cup  cold milk

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium saucepan, combine the berries, lemon juice, and 3 tablespoons sugar.  Place over medium heat and cook until just boiling, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and baking powder in a food processor and pulse quickly to blend.  Add the cold butter and pulse quickly until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg, almond extract, and milk until smooth.  With food processor going, add the liquid all at once and blend 10 to 15 seconds, until the ingredients just form a ball.  Remove the dough from the processor to a well-floured cutting board.

Shape the dough into a log about 14 inches long and 1 1/2 inches round.  Grease a cookie sheet with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and lay the log in a round in center.  Place in the preheated oven and bake until light golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove from the oven and allow the dough log to cool to room temperature.  Cut into slices about 1-inch thick.  Top each slice with 2 tablespoons of berry compote and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for drizzling
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  fennel bulb -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2              whole  dried pepperocini -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1         tablespoon  currants or raisins
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  6                     canned plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded
  1         tablespoon  toasted pine nuts
  6               cups  hot water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  stale bread broken into pieces
  10                    fresh mint leaves
     1/4           cup  fennel fronds

In a large soup pot, heat the 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic, fennel, whole chiles and currants and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the parsley, tomatoes and the toasted pine nuts, stirring to combine.  Cook the tomato mixture for about 25 to 30 minutes.

Add the hot water, salt, and pepper, to taste, stirring to combine.  Bring the tomato stock to a boil and add the bread pieces.  Allow the stock to cook 1 minute more so that the bread has a chance to heat up and thicken the stock before removing from the heat.

Stir in the mint leaves and fennel fronds and season each individual bowl of pancotto with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Garnish with fennel fronds and pepperocini.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large soup pot, heat the 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic, fennel, whole chiles and currants and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the parsley, tomatoes and the toasted pine nuts, stirring to combine.  Cook the tomato mixture for about 25 to 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the hot water, salt, and pepper, to taste, stirring to combine.  Bring the tomato stock to a boil and add the bread pieces.  Allow the stock to cook 1 minute more so that the bread has a chance to heat up and thicken the stock before removing from the heat.

Stir in the mint leaves and fennel fronds and season each individual bowl of pancotto with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Garnish with fennel fronds and pepperocini.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3                     celery stalks -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- untoasted
  3                     cloves
  1         tablespoon  golden raisins
  2                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4      teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped fine
     3/4           cup  white wine vinegar
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish
                        Red pepper flakes -- for garnish
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for garnish

Heat a 12- to 14-inch saucepan over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, add the duck pieces, skin-side down.  The duck skin will provide more than enough fat for browning without adding excess oil.  Cook, occasionally pouring excess fat off carefully, until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side.

Meanwhile, in medium-sized saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion, celery, and carrot, and saute over medium heat until softened, about 12 minutes.  Add the fennel seeds, pine nuts, cloves, raisins, bay leaves, flour and 1/2 cup vinegar and continue cooking for 2 minutes.

Add duck pieces and 1/4 cup vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, cover and lower the heat.  Braise over low heat until the sauce is thick, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove the cloves.  Remove the duck to a large plate and spoon vegetables over.

Stir the chocolate and sugar into the cooking liquid.  Serve sauce with the duck and garnish with chopped parsley, red pepper flakes and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Eggplant Cutlets - {Cotolette Di Melanzane}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  purple eggplants
                        Salt -- as needed
  3              large  eggs
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- chopped
  1                cup  bread crumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  grated cacviocavallo cheese -- for garnish
                        Pepperoncini -- for garnish
                        Fennel fronds -- for garnish
                        Orange wedges -- for garnish

Slice the eggplants into round slices, each about 1/2 -inch thick.  Sprinkle the slices liberally with salt and then place them in a colander.  It is all right if the eggplant slices overlap or cover one another.  Leave the eggplant in the colander for at least 1 hour, giving the salt time to absorb the eggplant's bitterness.  Don't rinse the eggplant, just shake off excess water.

When eggplant are ready to be used, use a fork to lightly beat the three eggs in a shallow bowl.  Spread the breadcrumbs out in a baking pan.  Season the eggplant slices to taste with salt and pepper.  Lightly dredge each eggplant slice first in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs.

In a 2-quart saucepan, heat extra-virgin olive oil to come up a 1/4 way up the side of the pan, over medium heat.  When the oil begins to smoke, lay several eggplant slices in a single layer in the pan.  Fry the slices until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.

When the first batch is cooked, remove the eggplant from the pan to a serving dish using a slotted spoon.  Repeat the cooking process, beginning by adding 3 fresh tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan, until all of the cutlets are cooked.

Serve warm, garnished with caciocavallo cheese, pepperoncino, fennel fronds and juice from the orange wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAFFRON RISOTTO ===
  5               cups  chicken or beef stock - (to 6)
     1/8      teaspoon  ground saffron
     1/8           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === EGGPLANTS AND STUFFING ===
  12                    baby eggplants, 4" to 5" long and
                        a little over 1"-thk, with stem
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              bunch  fresh mint leaves -- roughly chopped
     1/2         bunch  basil leaves -- cut chiffonade
                        = (reserve some for garnish)
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              large  egg yolk -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  water

To make the Saffron Risotto:  In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the stock until almost a boil.  Turn the heat to very low and stir in the saffron.

In a 10- to 12-inch saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Immediately stir in the rice and cook over medium-high heat.  Using a wooden spoon, stir continuously until the rice is coated in the butter and begins to turn translucent, about 2 minutes.  Be careful not to let the rice burn.

Keeping the heat at medium-high, begin ladling the hot broth into the rice, about 2 ladles at a time.  Constantly stir with the wooden spoon until the rice has almost absorbed all of the broth.  Continue adding the broth bit by bit until the rice is al dente or tender, about 18 to 20 minutes.  Once the rice is cooked, season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make the Stuffed Eggplants:  Par-bake eggplants in the oven for 25 minutes.  Cool.  Leave 1-inch on tops and bottoms of eggplant and cut lengthwise down the middle, making little pockets.

Combine the rice, garlic, mint, basil, cheese and egg yolk together in a medium bowl.  Mix until well combined.  Stuff an equal amount of the stuffing into each little pocket.  Be sure to overstuff the eggplants.  Use toothpicks to hold together, if necessary.

In a 12-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Fry the eggplant, in batches, until the skins begin to wrinkle.

In the meantime, heat the Basic Tomato Sauce in another 12-inch frying pan.  Add the sugar and stir to combine.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Stir in 1 cup of water.

Transfer the cooked eggplants to the pan with the tomato sauce, and spoon the sauce over the eggplants.  Simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Turn the eggplants over and cook for 5 more minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature with extra sauce and basil.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

To make the Saffron Risotto:  In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the stock until almost a boil.  Turn the heat to very low and stir in the saffron.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 10- to 12-inch saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Immediately stir in the rice and cook over medium-high heat.  Using a wooden spoon, stir continuously until the rice is coated in the butter and begins to turn translucent, about 2 minutes.  Be careful not to let the rice burn.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Keeping the heat at medium-high, begin ladling the hot broth into the rice, about 2 ladles at a time.  Constantly stir with the wooden spoon until the rice has almost absorbed all of the broth.  Continue adding the broth bit by bit until the rice is al dente or tender, about 18 to 20 minutes.  Once the rice is cooked, season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Stuffed Eggplants:  Par-bake eggplants in the oven for 25 minutes.  Cool.  Leave 1-inch on tops and bottoms of eggplant and cut lengthwise down the middle, making little pockets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the rice, garlic, mint, basil, cheese and egg yolk together in a medium bowl.  Mix until well combined.  Stuff an equal amount of the stuffing into each little pocket.  Be sure to overstuff the eggplants.  Use toothpicks to hold together, if necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Fry the eggplant, in batches, until the skins begin to wrinkle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the meantime, heat the Basic Tomato Sauce in another 12-inch frying pan.  Add the sugar and stir to combine.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Stir in 1 cup of water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the cooked eggplants to the pan with the tomato sauce, and spoon the sauce over the eggplants.  Simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Turn the eggplants over and cook for 5 more minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature with extra sauce and basil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTA ===
  4               cups  semolina flour
  6                     eggs
  6        tablespoons  dry white wine
  1              pinch  salt
                        === FOR THE RAGU ===
  4                     porcini mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1              small  garlic clove -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  fresh Italian sausage -- ground, or cut
                        into bite-sized chunks
  4              large  ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and roughly chopped, with their juices
  1                cup  red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        a chunk for serving

To make the pasta:  Sift together and then mound 2 1/4 cups of the flour and a pinch of salt in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and the wine, and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Knead for about 15 minutes, adding any of the remaining flour, if necessary to create a cohesive mass.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.

Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

After the dough has rested, use a sharp knife to cut the dough into medium pieces.  Put through a pasta machine and cut into 3-inch strips.  Using your thumb and forefinger, shape these pasta pieces into farfalle, or butterfly shaped pasta, squeezing at the center to form to wider sides, then flattening both sides to resemble wings.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  Set the farfalle on a baking sheet dusted with semolina flour and cover with a damp kitchen towel until ready to cook.

Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Using a damp cloth, carefully clean the porcini mushrooms.  Slice the mushrooms into medium size pieces.

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat the oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the sausage and cook until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes more.  Add the mushrooms, mixing well to combine, and season, to taste.  Add the tomatoes and their juices and the wine, salting lightly as you add.  Cover, and let cook over medium heat until the tomatoes soften and exude more juices, about 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the pasta to the boiling water.  Cook until tender but still al dente, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Drain well, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.  Add the pasta to the sausage mixture and toss over high heat until well combined.  Add some of the pasta cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the pasta is too dry.  Sprinkle with parsley and Parmigiano.  Serve immediately in warmed pasta bowls with a chunk of Parmigiano on the side for grating.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh sardines
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  4                     lemons
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2    tablespoon  chili flakes -- to taste
     1/2         bunch  parsley leaves -- finely chopped,
                        plus extra as needed
  4                     salt-packed anchovies
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
  1         tablespoon  raisins -- soaked, drained
  6                     fresh bay leaves

Remove the heads of the sardines and pull out the backbones and entrails.  Set the sardines aside.  In a small saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the bread crumbs.  Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, add 3 sliced lemons, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon chili flakes and 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.  Combine well and set aside for 1 hour.

Finely chop the anchovies, pine nuts, and raisins.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine 3/4 of the bread crumbs, anchovies, pine nuts, raisins, parsley, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Using a wooden spoon, toss until well-blended.  Use this filling to stuff each sardine, using your palms to gently fold each fish closed.  Secure with toothpicks.

Roll each sardine into a ball, starting at the tail end.  Gently lay the sardines side by side in a baking dish, keeping them close so that they retain their shape.  Sprinkle with salt.  Scatter 6 bay leaves throughout the dish.  Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs over the sardines.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine the juice of remaining lemon and 2 tablespoons sugar.  Drizzle the sugared juice over the sardines.  Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the dish and bake until the sardines are cooked, about 30 minutes.

Serve sardines with the lemon salad and sprinkle with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        more or greasing the pan
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  6              large  eggs -- separated
  5        tablespoons  instant espresso
  6        tablespoons  Dutch-processed cocoa powder
                        = (Droste recommended)
  6        tablespoons  dark rum or Marsala
  1 1/2           cups  ground toasted blanched almonds
                        All-purpose flour -- for coating pan
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Melt the butter in a glass bowl over simmering water.  Once the butter melts, whisk in the sugar and the egg yolks, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly so that the eggs become ribbon-like and light in color (don't scramble).  Whisk in the coffee, cocoa powder, rum and almonds, and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.

Transfer the cake mixture to a mixing bowl and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.

In a clean, separate mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until the just begin to stiffen and hold soft peaks.  Be sure to stop before they form hard peaks.  Gently fold the whites into the chocolate mixture.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until firm and beginning to separate from the sides, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool 30 minutes more.  Flip cake over, dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into wedges before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2           packages  dry active yeast
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting the work surface
                        Salt -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for frying
                        === TOPPINGS ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  4                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, drained,
                        and finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  4             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  3              large  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and minced
                        = (or 3 cups canned crushed Italian plum
                        tomatoes, finely chopped)
     1/2      teaspoon  chili flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated caciocavallo

Combine the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water in a bowl.  Let rest for 10 minutes so the yeast dissolves.

Put the flour into a large bowl with the salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the dissolved yeast and water mixture.  Add 1 cup cool water and the 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Using a wooden spoon, combine the ingredients until they form one mass of dough.  You may need to add some more cool water.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for about 10 minutes, until it is silky smooth.

Place the dough into a large, lightly floured bowl and turn it so that the entire surface of the dough is lightly coated with the flour.  Cover the bowl with a kitchen cloth and place in a warm area of your kitchen (the top of the refrigerator is ideal), and let rest until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

In the meantime, prepare the topping.  In a 12-inch saucepan over low heat, combine the 1/2 cup of the olive oil.  Add the scallions, anchovies, sugar and onions and continue carmelizing over low heat until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.

Add the tomatoes and chili flakes.  Stir to combine.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, being aware that the anchovies themselves are salty.  Continue simmering over low heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.

Remove from the heat and transfer mixture to a mixing bowl to cool.  Allow the mixture to come to room temperature.

When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead for 1 minute in the bowl.  On a lightly floured work surface, and using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.  Using a sharp knife, cut the rectangle into squares, 3 by 5 inches large.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in batches of 6, fry the dough until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the dough into the water, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished bread to a plate lined with paper towels.

As the bread is draining, reheat the tomato mixture, stirring well top recombine the ingredients.

Place the fried dough pieces on a warm serving platter and spoon about 2 tablespoons tomato mixture over the top of each piece.  Sprinkle with caciocavallo cheese, to taste, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Put the flour into a large bowl with the salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the dissolved yeast and water mixture.  Add 1 cup cool water and the 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Using a wooden spoon, combine the ingredients until they form one mass of dough.  You may need to add some more cool water.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for about 10 minutes, until it is silky smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the dough into a large, lightly floured bowl and turn it so that the entire surface of the dough is lightly coated with the flour.  Cover the bowl with a kitchen cloth and place in a warm area of your kitchen (the top of the refrigerator is ideal), and let rest until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the meantime, prepare the topping.  In a 12-inch saucepan over low heat, combine the 1/2 cup of the olive oil.  Add the scallions, anchovies, sugar and onions and continue carmelizing over low heat until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the tomatoes and chili flakes.  Stir to combine.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, being aware that the anchovies themselves are salty.  Continue simmering over low heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and transfer mixture to a mixing bowl to cool.  Allow the mixture to come to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead for 1 minute in the bowl.  On a lightly floured work surface, and using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.  Using a sharp knife, cut the rectangle into squares, 3 by 5 inches large.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working in batches of 6, fry the dough until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the dough into the water, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished bread to a plate lined with paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As the bread is draining, reheat the tomato mixture, stirring well top recombine the ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the fried dough pieces on a warm serving platter and spoon about 2 tablespoons tomato mixture over the top of each piece.  Sprinkle with caciocavallo cheese, to taste, and serve immediately.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  eggplants -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  3 1/4           cups  currants -- soaked in warm
                        water for 10 minutes, drained
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
     3/4           cup  fresh large roughly-cut bread crumbs -- plus
                        extra for breading
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling and
                        frying
  4               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chiles - (to 1 1/2)
     1/4           cup  chopped fennel tops
                        = (abt the tops of 2 fennel bulbs)

Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot.  Add the eggplant pieces and return to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the eggplant pieces are tender, about 10 minutes.

Drain the eggplant pieces on paper towels.  Poke holes in the flesh with a fork and squeeze out the excess liquid, a few pieces at a time, between 2 clean paper towels.  Roughly chop the eggplant and season with salt and pepper.

Place the warm eggplant into a bowl with 2 eggs, the grated cheese, mint, currants, pine nuts, and 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs.  The resulting mixture should be moist, but not wet.  Add some more bread crumbs if necessary.

Beat the remaining 2 eggs in a bowl.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and salt, to taste.  Shape the eggplant mixture into small balls about 1 1/4 inches in diameter (like a golf ball).  Coat each bowl with the egg and then roll the ball in bread crumbs.  Let the breaded balls rest for 10 minutes before frying.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in batches of 6, fry the eggplant balls until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the balls into the oil, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished balls, and drain them on paper towels.

In a 12-inch saucepan add the Basic Tomato Sauce.  Lay eggplant balls into sauce and add the fresh chiles.  Over medium-low heat, simmer for 30 minutes, gently stirring occasionally.  Sprinkle with the fennel tops and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Using 3 tablespoons of olive oil, brush mackerel skin with oil and place skin-side down onto grill.  Cook 5 to 6 minutes on the skin side.  Turn carefully, and cook 1 minute on the flesh side.  Gently remove mackerel pieces from the grill and place in the center of a large platter.

Place parsley leaves, mint leaves, anchovy and remaining 1 cup olive oil in a blender and chop until smooth.  Remove to a serving bowl and add chopped egg, capers, lemon juice, and lemon zest.  Season, to taste, with salt.  Mix well.

Arrange eggplant pieces around mackerel pieces and drizzle both with sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  boned leg of lamb -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1              large  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  red wine
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2        recipe  Basic Bread Dough III -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  fresh oregano
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten

In a 10- to 12-inch saucepan, heat the olive oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the pieces of lamb and brown all over.  Add the onions and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the wine and let it evaporate.  Dissolve the tomato paste in 1/2 cup warm water.  Add the dissolved tomato paste to the pan.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Lower the heat and let the ingredients simmer for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Meanwhile, cut the dough in half.  Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out into 2 rounds about 12-inches in diameter.  Coat the paddle with the sea salt.  Place 1 dough round on the paddle spread with coarse sea salt.

Once the stew is done simmering, spoon 1/2 the stew over the dough that is already on the paddle.  Fold dough over, using your fingers to crimp and seal the edges shut.  Prick the pie all over with a fork and, using a pastry brush, brush with the beaten egg yolk.  Repeat with remaining dough and stew.  Bake until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              pound  ground veal
  1              large  egg
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  4                     lemons -- zested, juiced
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- plus
                        extra for garnish
  4             slices  white sandwich bread -- soaked in
     2/3           cup  milk -- then torn in chunks
                        Salt -- to taste

  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

In a large mixing bowl, combine the veal, egg, garlic, lemon zest, Parmigiano, parsley, and the bread chunks, stirring with a wooden spoon until well mixed.  Salt and pepper, to taste.

Using your hands, mold the meat mixture into small meatballs, polpettine, about the size of golf balls.  Place the flour in a shallow bowl and dredge each meatball through the flour, shaking off any excess flour.

In a 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil over a medium flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the meatballs, and cook over a gentle heat, turning occasionally, until cooked through and golden brown on all sides, about 25 minutes.

Pour the lemon juice over the meatballs when they are cooked, making sure that each meatball absorbs some of the juice and lemon flavor.  Garnish with parsley and chili flakes.  Serve immediately.

Meanwhile, drop the pasta in the salted water and cook according to the package directions, to 1 minute short of al dente.  It should still be quite firm.  Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander and pour immediately into the saucepan with the potato mixture.

Toss the pasta and cook over high heat for 45 seconds.  Stir in the parsley, add some of the reserved water if the pasta seems too dry, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BECHAMEL SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  hot milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === CROQUETTES ===
  3               cups  Bechamel Sauce -- (listed above)
  1 1/2            cup  grated caciocavallo
  3              large  egg whites
                        Dried bread crumbs -- for coating
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for deep-frying
                        Salt -- to taste

To make the Bechamel Sauce:  Met the butter in a saucepan over low heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, constantly stirring, until the flour has "cooked" for about 2 minutes.  Slowly pour in the hot milk whisking constantly, and turn the heat to high.  Continue whisking until the sauce has visibly thickened.  Remove from the heat and salt, to taste.  (Makes about 5 cups bechamel)

For the Croquettes:  Stir the cacopcavallo into the bechamel.  Let the sauce cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate the sauce at least 1 hour before preparing the croquettes.

Cut the bechamel into 2-inch chunks.  Coat the chunks with the eggs and then completely cover in bread crumbs.  Place the croquette on a baking sheet to rest while you prepare the others.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in batches of 6, fry the croquettes until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the croquettes into the oil, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished croquettes to drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1              large  onion -- cut large dice
  1                     celery stalk -- cut large dice
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into half-moon shapes
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  boiled ham chunks or
                        end of prosciutto in large dice
  4             medium  tomatoes, fresh or canned -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped Italian parsley leaves
  6               cups  hot vegetable stock or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              small  zucchini -- medium diced
     3/4           cup  arborio rice
  2                     yellow, red, or orange bell peppers -- roasted, cored,
                        skinned, seeded and cut into strips
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  6                     fresh chopped basil leaves

In a heavy-bottomed soup pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat until hot, but not smoking.  Add the onion and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Lower the heat to low, and add the celery, carrots and garlic.  Allow to simmer over low heat until the vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes.  Add the ham pieces and cook 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the tomatoes and the parsley.  Cook for 5 more minutes so that the flavors meld.

Add the hot water or stock and season with salt and pepper.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and add the zucchini and the rice.  Bring back to a boil and then lower the heat so that the liquid is simmering.  Let simmer gently until the rice is cooked, about 40 minutes.  Remember to stir the soup occasionally.  Add more water or stock, if necessary.

When the rice is cooked, add the roasted peppers and remove the soup from the heat.  Stir in Parmesan, to taste, and top each serving with some chopped basil.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried borlotti beans
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- thinly sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- thinly sliced
     1/8         pound  fresh Italian sausage
  1 1/4            cup  Arborio rice
  1                     small head green cabbage -- washed, and
                        roughly chopped
  3                     canned whole peeled plum tomatoes -- seeds removed,
                        and roughly chopped
  6               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

Soak the borlotti beans overnight.  In the morning, drain the beans and place them in a medium-sized soup pan.

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat the oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and sweat over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the carrot and celery.

Meanwhile, slice the sausage into half moons.  Add the beans, sausage and the rice to the saucepan.  Using a wooden spoon, gently mix the rice in with the sausage and onion, so that the grains are coated in the olive oil, and the sausage is lightly browned.

Add the cabbage and tomatoes, and stir to combine.  Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Let simmer gently until the rice is cooked and the vegetables tender, about 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours for a thicker texture.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Serve with Parmigiano-Reggiano, for grating.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  cauliflower -- cored, and
                        cut into florets
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra as needed
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely sliced
  2                     salted anchovies (canned) -- rinsed, and
                        soaked for 4 to 6 hours
  1                     tomato -- skinned, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  raisins -- soaked, drained
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
  3                     strands saffron
  1              pound  dried ziti
                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Freshly-grated caciocavallo
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring 6-quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Divide the cauliflower into florets.  Blanch the cauliflower in the boiling water until half-cooked, about 10 minutes.  Drain the cauliflower, reserving the cooking water for the ziti.  Set the par-cooked cauliflower aside.

Chop and mince anchovies.

Dissolve the saffron strands in a few tablespoons of warm water.

Toss fish, tomato and sliced garlic.  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat in a saute pan.  Add the raisins, pine nuts, saffron tea, and the anchovies.  Using a wooden stir and continue cooking over medium heat until the anchovies dissolve, about 7 minutes.  Add half of the cooked cauliflower and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Cover and let cook until the cauliflower is tender, about 5 minutes.

Lower heat to low and allow to cook, uncovered, while you prepare the ziti.  Return the cauliflower water to a boil.  Add the ziti and cook halfway, about 5 minutes.  Drain the pasta and add to the sauce.  Add the remaining cauliflower, cover and let stew over medium-low heat until the pasta and cauliflower are cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Toss with extra-virgin olive oil, chopped parsley and caciocavallo.  Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fennel bulbs -- greens removed and
                        reserved/ bulb cut into sticks
  3             pounds  whole fresh sardines
                        Semolina flour -- for coating
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- minced
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, chopped
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
  3        tablespoons  dried currants or raisins -- soaked, drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  7                     saffron strands
                        = (or 1/2 tspn powdered saffron)
  1              pound  dried bucatini

In a hot skillet, add olive oil and saute fennel until caramelized.

Remove the heads of the sardines and pull out the backbones and entrails.  Select a few sardines, for garnish.  Chop the rest of the sardines for the sauce, set aside.

Season the sardines for garnish, to taste with salt and pepper, and coat them with the semolina flour.  In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of olive oil over medium heat.  When the oil begins to smoke, cook each flour-coated sardine until a light golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the sardines from the pan and set them aside to drain on a paper towel.

In the skillet with the caramelized fennel, add the onions, currants, tomatoes, pine nuts and saffron.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Bring the sauce briefly to a boil and then lower to a simmer.  Add the reserved sardines and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sardines have broken into pieces and are thoroughly mixed into the sauce, about 10 to 15 minutes.  If the sauce appears too thick at this point, add a little of the pasta cooking water.

Bring 6 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a rolling boil.  Add the bucatini and cook until tender but still al dente.  Drain the cooked pasta into a large serving bowl, add 3/4 of the sauce and stir to combine.  Top with the remaining sauce and the fried sardines.

This pasta tastes best if allowed to sit for several minutes, soaking up the flavors of the sauce, before it is served.  Keep the pasta covered during this waiting period, then garnish with reserved fennel fronds.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season the sardines for garnish, to taste with salt and pepper, and coat them with the semolina flour.  In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of olive oil over medium heat.  When the oil begins to smoke, cook each flour-coated sardine until a light golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the sardines from the pan and set them aside to drain on a paper towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the skillet with the caramelized fennel, add the onions, currants, tomatoes, pine nuts and saffron.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Bring the sauce briefly to a boil and then lower to a simmer.  Add the reserved sardines and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sardines have broken into pieces and are thoroughly mixed into the sauce, about 10 to 15 minutes.  If the sauce appears too thick at this point, add a little of the pasta cooking water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a rolling boil.  Add the bucatini and cook until tender but still al dente.  Drain the cooked pasta into a large serving bowl, add 3/4 of the sauce and stir to combine.  Top with the remaining sauce and the fried sardines.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This pasta tastes best if allowed to sit for several minutes, soaking up the flavors of the sauce, before it is served.  Keep the pasta covered during this waiting period, then garnish with reserved fennel fronds.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  butternut squash or pumpkin -- seeds removed,
                        baked 1 hour at 375 degrees
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bread crumbs -- divided
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese
                        Freshly-ground nutmeg -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Butter an 8-inch springform pan and preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, place 2 1/2 cups squash flesh, 1 cup of the bread crumbs, eggs, grated cheese, mascarpone, nutmeg, salt and pepper, and stir to blend well.  The resulting mixture will have a batter-like consistency.

Use the remaining bread crumbs to dust the springform pan.  Pour the batter into the pan and bake until set and a toothpick exits cleanly, about 30 45 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool 20 minutes.  Unmold on to plate and serve either hot or cold.

             Pork And Cabbage Pockets - {Bracciole Di Maiale}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  cavolo nero (black cabbage)
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2                     Spanish onions sliced thin
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/8           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
  1              pinch  chili flakes
  1              pound  pork loin -- cut 4 equal pieces,
                        then pounded to form large flat pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  vernaccia
                        = (or other dry white wine)
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Cut the cabbage into 2-inch ribbons.  Add the cabbage to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 6 minutes.  Drain well and set aside to cool.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft about 5 minutes.  Add parsley, fennel seeds, cooked cabbage and chili flakes, then toss to mix and remove from heat.

Lay the pork pieces out flat on a board and season well with salt.  Divide the cabbage mixture over the 4 pieces and fold the pieces across to create a pocket, close and secure with toothpicks.

Heat 4 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil in another 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium heat.  Place the pork pockets in the pan and cook until golden brown on both sides.  Add the wine, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.

Remove the pork to a plate, swirl the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil into the pan, add chopped parsley to the liquid, pour over the pockets and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Russet potatoes
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley -- plus
                        more for garnishing
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
     1/4           cup  Caciocavalla cheese

Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes.  Place the potatoes in a large pot filled with salted water.  Bring the water to a boil, lower to a simmer and let potatoes cook until cooked through, about 8 minutes.

When the potatoes are cooked, drain and pass through a food mill.  Add the chopped garlic, parsley, salt, pepper and eggs to the potato puree.  Stir in a drizzle extra-virgin olive oil with a wooden spoon until seasoning is spread evenly throughout the puree.  Allow the puree to cool.

While potato mixture cools, fill a deep pot no more than halfway full with extra-virgin olive oil.  Over a medium-high heat, heat the oil to 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the frying process.

Using your palms, shape chunks of the potato puree into oval-shaped croquettes, about 2 inches in length.  When the oil reaches 350 degrees, begin frying the fritters in batches of 6 until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the fritters into the water, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.

Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished cazilli to a serving plate.  Repeat the frying process until all the potato mixture has been used.

Garnish with parsley and cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                   Rice Fritters - {Crespelle Di Riso}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  short-grain Italian pudding rice
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  2 1/2           cups  water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Peel of 1 orange -- in large pieces
     1/4         pound  fresh ricotta cheese
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
     2/3           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  superfine sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon

Place the rice, milk, 2 1/2 cups of water, a pinch of salt, and the orange zest in a 10- to 12-inch saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat, and then turn the heat to low, stirring constantly.  Cook until the rice is soft and has absorbed all the liquid, about 20 minutes. Place the cooked rice on a serving platter and let it stand overnight or for at least 8 hours.

The next day, remove the pieces of orange peel from the rice.  Place the rice, the ricotta, and the flour in a large bowl, and stir to combine well.  Keep stirring until you have formed a well-blended, firm paste.

Using a wooden spoon or spatula, spread the rice out on a flat plate or a wooden cutting board that you can keep at hand while you fry.  The rice should be spread in a layer that is about 1/4-inch thick.  Cut the rice into strips about 2-inches long and 1/2-inch wide.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in small batches of 6, carefully lift the slices of rice paste and lay them in the hot oil.  In order for the slices to remain intact, use a flat, slotted spatula to lift and transfer the slices.  Fry the crespelle until golden brown.  Use the same slotted spatula to remove the finished fritters to a plate lined with paper towels.  Drain on paper towels as they cook.  Continue this process until all the fritters are cooked.  Allow the fritters to cool slightly.

In the meantime, heat the honey and the remaining water in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Dip each fritter in the warm honey, remove, and place on a serving platter.  Sprinkle the dipped fritters with sugar and cinnamon and serve warm.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen fritters.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting work surface
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for frying
  2               cups  drained ricotta
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced fresh mint leaves
  1              piece  Bottarga cheese - (abt 2")
  1              pinch  chili flakes -- for garnish

For the Dough:  Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center of the flour, then pour the olive oil and about 1 cup of lukewarm water.  Using a wooden spoon, stir the ingredients until they combine to form a dough, adding a little lukewarm water if necessary.  Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for 10 minutes.  Let rest for 10 minutes.

In the meantime, in a bowl, pour extra-olive oil over the ricotta.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper and parsley.  Mix until soft.  Add more oil, if necessary.

Divide the dough into 3 equal portions.  Using the widest opening of a manual pasta rolling machine, roll each portion into a piece 3 feet long, about 4 inches wide and 1/16th of an inch thick.  If you do not have a pasta roller, you can also use a lightly floured rolling pin.  It is easiest to roll and stuff one portion at a time, rather than rolling all three before stuffing.

For each strip of dough, place rounded teaspoons of ricotta 1-inch from the edge of the lengthwise side of dough, spacing the ricotta about 2 inches apart.  For the first strip of dough, sprinkle the ricotta mounds with the freshly grated Pecorino.  With the second strip, sprinkle with the chopped mint.  Grate the bottarga evenly over the third.

Fold the dough in half lengthwise, covering the ricotta-filled portion to the edge, as if you were folding a blanket.  Using your fingers, press on the edges of the dough to seal the outside edge.  Press also in-between the mounds of ricotta to create individual ricotta portions.

Using a sharp knife or a serrated pastry cutter, cut around each mound of ricotta, making 2-inch squares.  Place the panzerotti on a lightly floured baking sheet, uncovered.  Make the remaining doughnuts, sprinkling the mint over the second batch and grating the bottarga over the third.  They can rest for 1 hour.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in batches of 6, fry the panzerotti until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the doughnuts into the water, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished doughnuts to a plate lined with paper towels.  Drain on paper towels as they cook.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  brewer's yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  6 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     anchovy fillets - (to 7) -- rinsed, drained,
                        and patted dry
  1              pound  fresh ricotta cheese
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
                        Chopped Italian parsley leaves -- for garnish
     1/4           cup  grated pecorino

In a small bowl, dissolve the brewer's yeast in 1 1/2 cups warm water.  The yeast should bubble slightly as it dissolves.  If not, the yeast is stale and you will need to try again with fresh yeast.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine the dissolved yeast and the flour, and season with salt and pepper.  Knead the resulting dough, adding more water if necessary to create a springy, paste-like dough.  Cover with a damp kitchen cloth and leave for 2 hours to rise in a warm place (such as the tip of the refrigerator).

In the meantime, cut the anchovy fillets into tiny pieces, and place them in a bowl.  Place the ricotta in a separate bowl.  Using a fork, crush the ricotta so that no large lumps remain, stir in anchovies.

When the dough has risen, dampen your palm slightly, and break off a small (1-inch) piece of dough.  Using the fingertips of your other hand, pat this dough into an open shell-like shape.  In the resulting hollow, spoon 1 tablespoon of ricotta filling.  Pull up the edges of the dough so that it covers the filling and forms a closed and rounded shape.  Set aside.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in small batches of 6, carefully lift the ricotta balls and place them in the hot oil.  Fry the fritters until golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon or spatula, remove the finished fritters to a plate lined with paper towels.  Drain on paper towels as they cook.  Continue this process until all the fritters are cooked.  Serve hot, garnished with parsley and pecorino.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen fritters.

In a small bowl, dissolve the brewer&apos;s yeast in 1 1/2 cups warm water.  The yeast should bubble slightly as it dissolves.  If not, the yeast is stale and you will need to try again with fresh yeast.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium-sized bowl, combine the dissolved yeast and the flour, and season with salt and pepper.  Knead the resulting dough, adding more water if necessary to create a springy, paste-like dough.  Cover with a damp kitchen cloth and leave for 2 hours to rise in a warm place (such as the tip of the refrigerator).
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the meantime, cut the anchovy fillets into tiny pieces, and place them in a bowl.  Place the ricotta in a separate bowl.  Using a fork, crush the ricotta so that no large lumps remain, stir in anchovies.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the dough has risen, dampen your palm slightly, and break off a small (1-inch) piece of dough.  Using the fingertips of your other hand, pat this dough into an open shell-like shape.  In the resulting hollow, spoon 1 tablespoon of ricotta filling.  Pull up the edges of the dough so that it covers the filling and forms a closed and rounded shape.  Set aside.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working in small batches of 6, carefully lift the ricotta balls and place them in the hot oil.  Fry the fritters until golden brown.  Using a slotted spoon or spatula, remove the finished fritters to a plate lined with paper towels.  Drain on paper towels as they cook.  Continue this process until all the fritters are cooked.  Serve hot, garnished with parsley and pecorino.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 4 dozen fritters.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  milk
  3                     oranges -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2       teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, use a wooden spoon to mix the eggs, flour and milk.  Keep mixing, switching to a whisk if necessary until the mixture is homogenous.  You can also use an electric mixer fitted with a whisk.

In an 8-inch frying pan over high heat, melt the butter, letting it cook until it foams.  Gently pour the egg mixture in all at once and cook as you would a frittata, initially scrambling until the eggs begin to set, then letting the mixture settle across the pan and cook until the bottom side is golden brown.

Add a pinch of sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, and half of the orange juice to the center of the frittata.  Roll the frittata as you would an omelet, and lay in a baking dish.

Dust with the remaining sugar, remaining cinnamon and douse with the remaining orange juice.  Place in the oven and bake until the juice and spices form a golden crust, about 5 minutes.  Slice into 4 portions and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1                     lemon -- for garnish
                        === ONION SALAD ===
  2             medium  onions - (to 3) -- thinly sliced
  1                     lemon -- juiced

  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint leaves
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

Soak the salt cod, immersed in cool water and covered well, overnight in the refrigerator.  Change the water 4 times at 3-hour intervals during day hours.

Drain the salt cod and pat it dry, pressing upon the flesh to squeeze out any excess water.  Clean thoroughly, removing any skin and bones.

Chop the salt cod into 1/4-inch cubes and put it into a bowl with the eggs, currants, pine nuts, bread crumbs and parsley.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Mix well to combine.

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Working in batches of 6, fry the cod balls until golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon or spider to gently drop the balls into the oil, being careful not to splatter the hot oil.  Using the same spoon or spider, remove the finished balls to drain on paper towels.

Combine onions, lemon juice, chili flakes and mint.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve immediately garnished with the lemon.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  6             pieces  osso buco -  (2" ea)
                        = (specific cut of veal shank)
     2/3           cup  Sicilian olives (the green variety) -- pitted, chopped
  4        tablespoons  capers -- washed, drained
  4                     peperoncini (marinated red peppers) -- well drained,
                        and chopped
                        = (or sub roasted red peppers)
  3              large  ripe red tomatoes -- cored, peeled,
                        and roughly chopped
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2               cups  Marsala
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Transfer the shanks to a covered, heavy baking dish just large enough to hold the shanks comfortably.  Set aside.

Deglaze with the Marsala.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Let simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often.  If the mixture becomes too dry, add a teaspoonful or 2 of water.

Spoon equal amounts of the sauce over each shank.  Cover and cook until the veal is very tender, about 45 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Bread Dough II -- (see recipe)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  16                    marinated salt-packed anchovies -- soaked in water,
                        and rinsed
  1                     fennel bulb -- fronds removed and
                        saved, bulb trimmed and sliced 1/8" thick
  1                cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SUN-DRIED TOMATO FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped sun-dried tomato

Fill a deep pot no more than halfway with extra-virgin olive oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 360 to 365 degrees.  The oil should remain at or around this temperature throughout the cooking process.

Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into 4 (10-inch) circles, 1/4-inch thick or less.  Fry the dough until golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes, to create the tarongia.  Using a slotted spoon or spider, remove the finished fritters to drain on paper towels.

In 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil until just smoking and add the fennel pieces.  Cook until soft and golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain the fennel and allow to cool.  Mix in the fennel fronds (tops) and set aside.

Spread 1/4 of the fennel mixture on top of each tarongia.  Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons caciocavallo and black pepper.  Place 4 anchovies on each tarongia and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.  Broil each tarongia until light golden brown and serve warm.

Sun-dried Tomato Filling:  Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a saute pan.  Add onion and sun-dried tomato and quickly saute.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

            Spaghetti In A Package - {Spaghetti Al Cartoccio}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  mussels -- cleaned, de-bearded
  1              pound  clams -- cleaned
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive -- plus
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  water
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  calamari rings
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  fresh or canned Italian plum tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
     1/2         bunch  fresh chopped parsley leaves -- plus
                        extra for garnish
                        Chili pepper flakes -- to taste
  1              pound  spaghetti

Place the mussels and clams in a large pot with a lid.  Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, white wine and the water.  Stir to combine.  Cover the pot with the lid and place over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the shells open, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and carefully remove the mussels and clams from their shells.  Pass the liquid through a fine strainer and reserve.

Pour 1/2 cup of olive oil in a 3- or 4-quart saucepan over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the garlic and cook until pale gold, about 5 minutes.  Add the calamari, season with salt and pepper, and cook over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, and simmer for 20 minutes more.  Add lots of parsley, mussels, clams, chili flakes and reserved broth.  Simmer, covered, for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

In a large pot, bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the spaghetti and parboil 6 minutes, stirring often.  Drain and remove to a strainer in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.  Drain the pasta and add to a bowl.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss.  Spoon half of the seafood sauce over the pasta and toss again to mix well.

Using a large square piece of foil turn up all 4 sides of the foil square, forming a 3- to 4-inch wall barricade, so that the sauce won't run out.  Spoon all of the pasta and sauce onto the foil square.  Pull the sides of the foil in over the mound of pasta and sauce, and seal at the top to form a large package.  This can also be done using 4 smaller-sized squares of foil, to create 4 smaller packages.

Place the package (or packages) on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes.

Carefully transfer the cooked package (or packages) to 1 large serving dish (or 4 smaller ones).  Slice the top of the package open with a knife and serve hot.  Garnish with parsley and chili pepper flakes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  2                     scallions -- sliced
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1              pound  dried spaghetti
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  salted ricotta cheese -- grated
     1/4           cup  grated pecorino
  1              pinch  red chili flakes
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish

Wash and dry the zucchini and trim the ends.  Slice zucchini into thin disks about 1/4-inch thick.  Set the zucchini slices aside.  In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil, add a layer of zucchini and cook or "poach" like chips.  Remove zucchini and drain.  Repeat with remaining zucchini.  Place zucchini into a serving bowl.

Add the garlic and scallions to the saucepan and cook until they are soft and golden brown.  Add the red wine vinegar and let cook until the vinegar evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Toss into the bowl with the zucchini.

Fill a heavy-bottomed saucepan with 6 quarts water and bring to a boil.  Add 2 tablespoons salt, stirring to dissolve.  Cook the spaghetti according to the package directions, until tender but still al dente.  Drain the pasta.

Toss the pasta with the zucchini, and add salt and pepper, to taste.  Add the ricotta and the Pecorino.  Serve immediately garnished with red chili flakes and chopped parsley.

  2             pounds  very young peas
  2             pounds  very young fava beans
  12             small  tender artichokes
     1/2                lemon juiced
     1/2         bunch  scallions
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     bay leaf
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves

Shell the peas and the fava beans and set them aside in separate containers.

Carefully slice off the tips of the artichokes, remove all of the tough outer leaves, and peel the base.  Cut the artichoke into quarters and remove the choke, as well as any prickly tips that may have formed on the inner leaves.  Cut each of these quarters into thirds, so as to have tiny wedges.  Let artichokes sit in water and lemon juice.

Fill a heavy-bottomed saucepan with 1/4 cup hot water.  Slice the scallions and add them to the water.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until all of the water has evaporated.  Add the 4 tablespoons olive oil and saute the scallions until a pale golden, about 3 minutes.

Add the artichokes, 1/4 cup hot water, bay leaf and salt, to taste.  Cover and cook over low heat until the artichokes begin to soften, about 5 minutes.

Add the fava beans and salt, to taste.  Cover and cook another 5 minutes.

Add the peas and 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Cover and cook for 5 more minutes, sprinkle with the vinegar, and add some black pepper, to taste.  Continue cooking, uncovered over medium-high heat for until the vinegar has evaporated, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Refrigerate for 24 hours and serve cold drizzled with remaining extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkled with parsley.  This dish can be served warm, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1                     amaretti (almond) cookie -- crushed
  4                     thin breadsticks -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  grappa

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12-inch saucepan, heat the butter over a medium flame until it foams.  Add the veal and the prosciutto and cook until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside.

Peel the onions and carefully drop in the boiling water.  Cook until the onions are tender but still retain their shape, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Drain the onions and set aside to cool.

Once the onions are cool enough to handle, cut them in half cross-wise, and carefully remove the very center from each half of the onion.  This will create pocket for the stuffing.  Repeat with remaining onions.

Crack 1 egg, and, using a wooden spoon, mix the egg into the cooled meat mixture.  Salt and pepper, to taste, add 3 tablespoons Parmigiano and a pinch of nutmeg and mix until well combined.

Lightly grease a 13-inch baking dish.  Use a spoon to gently spread meat mixture on top of each onion half.  Place the stuffed onions, stuffing-side up, into the prepared pan.  Drizzle the grappa over the onion halves.  Sprinkle the onions with the crushed cookie and crushed breadsticks.  Sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano.  Place in the oven and bake until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly, about 45 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Stuffed Sardine 'sausages' - {'sasizzeddi Di Sardo'}

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh sardines
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  bread crumbs -- toasted
     1/3           cup  finely-diced Caciocavallo cheese
  1 1/2    tablespoons  raisins -- soaked, drained
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     oranges -- sliced, plus
  1                     orange -- juiced
  2              large  eggs
                        Flour -- for coating
                        Fennel fronds
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Cracked pepperocini -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish
                        Toothpicks, metal skewers or
                        wooden skewers -- soaked 30 minutes

Remove the heads of the sardines and pull out the backbones and entrails.  Rinse each sardine in cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.  Set aside to soak for about 1 hour in a shallow dish filled with the white wine vinegar.

In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  When the oil begins to shimmer, add 2 cloves sliced garlic and 3 sardines and cook until they disintegrate.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in the breadcrumbs until they are well-moistened.  Add the Caviocavallo, raisins, parsley and pine nuts.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Continue stirring over medium heat for about 2 minutes.

Remove the stuffing from the heat.  Lay 1 orange slice in each sardine, then spoon 1 tablespoon of the bread crumb stuffing.  Using toothpicks, close fish securely.

Using a fork, beat the eggs in a shallow bowl.  Spread some flour in a baking dish.  Carefully, so as not to damage the sardines, gently dredge each sardine first through the egg mixture and then through the flour, shaking gently at the end to remove the excess flour.  Saute in pan with oil until golden brown.

Transfers to plates and garnish with fennel fronds, sea salt, cracked pepperocini, orange juice, extra-virgin olive oil, black pepper and mint leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Orange wedges -- for garnish
                        Pepperoncini -- for garnish

Remove all the skin and trim the fat from the chicken.  Cut the chicken into 8 small pieces, using both the breast and the thighs, season with salt and pepper.

In a Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  When the oil starts to shimmer, add the chicken pieces and cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes on each side.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken pieces from the pan and set them aside.

Add the onions and celery and let cook, stirring constantly, until soft and slightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Return the chicken pieces to the pot.  Add the currants, sugar, vinegar, olives, capers and half the almonds.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Turn the heat to high and cook, turning the chicken constantly, until the vinegar evaporates, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Turn the heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan and allow the chicken to cook through, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Serve family style, garnished with the remaining almonds, fennel fronds, juice from orange wedges and pepperoncini.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FRESH EGG PASTA ===
  2 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  12             large  egg yolks
                        === TAGLIATELLE ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  chicken livers
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     white or black truffle
     3/4           cup  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

For the Fresh Egg Pasta:  Sift together and then mound 2 1/4 cups of the flour and a pinch of salt in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg yolks.  Using a fork, beat together the egg yolks and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Knead for about 5 to 6 minutes, adding any of the remaining flour if necessary to create a cohesive mass.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for six more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Divide the prepared pasta dough into 3 balls of equal size.  Roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Then, using the machine or a sharp knife, cut each sheet of pasta into ribbons of 1/3-inch thickness.  Place the ribbons on a sheet tray dusted with flour, and cover the tray with a clean, damp dish towel until ready to cook.

Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat the olive oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and sweat over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, add the chicken livers to the pan and continue cooking until the livers are slightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes more.

Add the wine and continue cooking over medium-high heat until the wine evaporates.  Continue cooking over medium heat for 10 minutes more.

Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until soft but al dente, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water, and add the pasta to the pan with the chicken livers.  Add parsley and toss over high heat to combine.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve the pasta in 4 warmed pasta bowls, each topped with generous truffle shavings, and grated Parmigiano, to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

<DirT>
Divide the prepared pasta dough into 3 balls of equal size.  Roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Then, using the machine or a sharp knife, cut each sheet of pasta into ribbons of 1/3-inch thickness.  Place the ribbons on a sheet tray dusted with flour, and cover the tray with a clean, damp dish towel until ready to cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch saucepan, heat the olive oil over a medium-high flame until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and sweat over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, add the chicken livers to the pan and continue cooking until the livers are slightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the wine and continue cooking over medium-high heat until the wine evaporates.  Continue cooking over medium heat for 10 minutes more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until soft but al dente, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water, and add the pasta to the pan with the chicken livers.  Add parsley and toss over high heat to combine.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve the pasta in 4 warmed pasta bowls, each topped with generous truffle shavings, and grated Parmigiano, to taste.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  3               cups  whole-wheat flour
  5              whole  large eggs -- plus
  5                     egg yolks
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary -- leaves only
  1              pound  ground veal shoulder
  1              pound  ground pork
  1 1/2         pounds  spinach -- washed, spun dry,
                        and roughly chopped
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  3              large  eggs
                        Freshly grated nutmeg -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Dough:  Sift together and then mound 3 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Knead for about 15 minutes, adding any of the remaining four if necessary to create a cohesive mass.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.

Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

For the Filling:  Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12-inch saucepan, add 1 tablespoon butter over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the garlic and rosemary, and let cook until the garlic is light golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the veal and pork meat, and brown on all sides, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Do not be afraid to let the meat begin to caramelize a bit.

Cook the spinach in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain well and add to the meat.  Stir in the Parmigiano, 3 whole eggs, a pinch of nutmeg, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Use a wooden spoon to mix until well combined.  Set aside.

Cut the pasta dough into 3 equally sized pieces.  Re-wrap 2 of the pieces in plastic wrap and set aside.  Begin working with the 1 unwrapped piece of dough.  On a lightly floured work surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the pasta dough until it is 1/8-inch thick (you can also use a pasta machine and roll out the dough on its thinnest setting).

Lay the resulting pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface with a long side facing you.  Trim the edges so they are straight.  Using a tablespoon, scoop equally-sized spoonfuls of the filling and place along the bottom half of the pasta sheet, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border of dough at the bottom and sides: each dollop of filling should be approximately 1 1/2-inches away from the next.  Pull the top edge of the pasta up and over the filling.  The dough should form 1 large pocket over the dollops of filling.

Seal the agnolotti by gently carefully molding the pasta over the filling and pressing lightly with your index finger to seal the edge of the dough to the pasta sheet; don't drag your finger along the dough to seal, or you risk ripping the dough.  When it is sealed, there should be about 1/2-inch of excess dough visible along the bottom of the mounds of filling (where you sealed it).  Be certain that you are sealing tightly while pressing out any pockets of air.  Seal the left and right ends of the dough.

To shape agnolotti:  Starting at 1 end of the dough, place the thumb and forefinger of each hand together as if you were going to pinch something and, leaving about 1-inch of space between your hands and holding your fingers vertically, pinch the filling in 1-inch increments, making about 3/4-inch of "pinched" area between each pocket of filling.  It is important to leave this much "pinched" area between the agnolotti, or when the agnolotti are separated, they may come unsealed.

Run a sharp knife or crimped pastry wheel along the bottom edge of the folded-over dough, separating the strip of filled pockets from the remainder of the pasta sheet.  Don't cut too close to the filling, or you risk breaking the seal.  Separate the individual agnolotti by cutting the center of each pinched area, rolling the pastry wheel away from you.  Working quickly, place the agnolotti on a baking sheet dusted with a thin layer of cornmeal, which will help prevent sticking.  Don't let the agnolotti touch each other, or they may stick together.

Repeat with the 2 remaining dough balls until the entire bowl of filling has been used.  Let the shaped agnolotti rest for 24 minutes.

Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil, and add 2 tablespoons salt. Add the agnolotti to the water and cook until tender, about 4 minutes total.  Drain well and toss with a sauce or ragu of your choice or a combination of beef broth and butter.  Sprinkle with cheese and parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

To make the Dough:  Sift together and then mound 3 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Knead for about 15 minutes, adding any of the remaining four if necessary to create a cohesive mass.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Filling:  Bring 6 quarts water to a rolling boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12-inch saucepan, add 1 tablespoon butter over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the garlic and rosemary, and let cook until the garlic is light golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the veal and pork meat, and brown on all sides, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Do not be afraid to let the meat begin to caramelize a bit.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the spinach in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain well and add to the meat.  Stir in the Parmigiano, 3 whole eggs, a pinch of nutmeg, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Use a wooden spoon to mix until well combined.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the pasta dough into 3 equally sized pieces.  Re-wrap 2 of the pieces in plastic wrap and set aside.  Begin working with the 1 unwrapped piece of dough.  On a lightly floured work surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the pasta dough until it is 1/8-inch thick (you can also use a pasta machine and roll out the dough on its thinnest setting).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay the resulting pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface with a long side facing you.  Trim the edges so they are straight.  Using a tablespoon, scoop equally-sized spoonfuls of the filling and place along the bottom half of the pasta sheet, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border of dough at the bottom and sides: each dollop of filling should be approximately 1 1/2-inches away from the next.

When it is sealed, there should be about 1/2-inch of excess dough visible along the bottom of the mounds of filling (where you sealed it).

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste, plus
                        Crushed black pepper -- for garnish
  2             ounces  olive oil
                        Lemon wedges
                        === HERB SALAD ===
                        Basil leaves - (large) -- as needed
                        Parsley leaves -- as needed
  1                     lemon -- halved
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat barbecue or grill.

Using a kitchen mallet or wide cleaver, pound each slice of veal between 2 oiled pieces of waxed paper until thin yet not torn, about 1/16-inch thick.  Lay each piece out on a cool working surface.

In a mixing bowl, stir together Pecorino, bread crumbs, parsley, pine nuts and plumped, drained currants until well blended.  Season the veal slices with salt and pepper.

Divide the Pecorino mixture among the 8 pieces of veal, spreading it out thinly.  Roll the veal up tightly like a burrito and secure with toothpicks.

Lay 4 pair of veal rolls side by side 1/2-inch apart and skewer them with 2 rosemary sprigs to yield 4 sets.  Season with salt and pepper, and brush with olive oil.  Grill until cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes per side, and serve immediately with lemon wedges.  Serve with Herb Salad.

For the Herb Salad:  Combine basil and parsley in a large bowl.  Squeeze the juice of the lemons over herbs and sprinkle with extra-virgin olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.

                        Chili flakes -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Have a butcher remove the bone from the veal breast and butterfly the breast open.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until smoking and add the Swiss chard.  Cooked until wilted but not fully cooked, about 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow the greens to cool completely.  Add the grated cheese, sundried tomatoes and eggs, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Season the veal.  Spoon the stuffing on the inside of the veal pocket and gently roll the veal up like a jelly roll.  Using butcher's twine, tie the veal roll securely and season the outside with salt and pepper.

In an oven-ready thick-bottomed casserole over medium heat, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil until smoking.  Gently add the rolled veal breast and brown on all sides, turning frequently for about 10 minutes.

Drain the oil from the pan, add the white wine and tomato sauce, and bring to a boil.  Cover pan with a lid or with foil and place in the oven.  Cook 1 to 1/2 hours or until fork tender.  Remove and allow to stand for 10 minutes.

Carve and garnish with chopped parsley, marjoram, chili flakes and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Bechamel Sauce - {Besciamella} -- see recipe
  1                cup  grated Gruyere
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1              large  egg -- separated
  2        tablespoons  bread crumbs -- plus
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  4                     veal cutlets -- pounded thin by
                        your butcher
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  red wine
                        Chopped parsley leaves

In a small saucepan, bring the bescimella to a gentle boil.  Add the 2 cheeses and stir with a wooden spoon until the cheese is melted and the mixture homogenous.  Add the egg yolk, reserving the white, 2 tablespoons bread crumbs and mix to combine, being sure not to let the egg settle on the bottom of the pan and cook.  Season, to taste, with pepper and remove from the heat.

Lay the veal cutlets flat on a clean work surface, so that 1 of the short sides is facing you, i.e. the veal cutlets should stretch the long way away from you.  Season both sides with salt and pepper.

Divide the besciamella mixture equally among the veal cutlets, spreading it across the center of the meat so that you leave a border of meat on all sides.  Starting with side closest to you, carefully roll the veal slices into small rolls, much as you would roll a burrito, being careful not to let the bescimella slide out the sides.  Secure with toothpicks.

Place the egg white and the 1/2 cup bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls.  Dredge the veal rolls first through the egg white and then the bread crumbs.  Shake off any excess bread crumbs.

Place a 12-inch saucepan over a medium-high flame and add 1 tablespoon of the butter and 5 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Heat the oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the veal rolls and cook until golden brown on all sides, turning carefully with kitchen tongs, about 10 minutes total.  Remove veal rolls to a serving platter and keep warm.  Add 1/2 cup red wine the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan.  Cook until the sauce thickens.  Add chopped parsley and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Drizzle the sauce over the veal rolls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  dried bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  grated caciocavallo cheese
     1/4           cup  currants -- soaked in hot water
                        for 10 minutes and drained
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts
  1              bunch  fresh chopped parsley leaves -- reserve some
                        for garnish
  1              large  egg
  2 1/2         pounds  veal scallops -- cut thin pieces,
                        about 2" wide and 6" long
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             medium  onions -- cut 24 chunks,
                        and lightly roasted
  24             small  bay leaves
                        Lemon halves

Set out 6 (8-inch) metal or wooden skewers.  If you are using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them in water for 30 minutes before using.

Place a medium frying pan over medium-low heat.  Add 1/4 cup olive oil and heat until hot, but not smoking.  Add the bread crumbs.  Stir constantly and cook until golden, about 5 minutes.  The mixture should be moist, but not wet.  Remove from the heat and place the bread crumbs in a bowl.  Add the caciocavallo, currants, pine nuts, parsley and egg and gently mix together.

Preheat grill or broiler.

Spread the veal slices out onto a clean work surface.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon equal amounts of the bread crumb stuffing into the center of each veal piece, gently patting the stuffing down.  Roll each veal piece into a small roll.

Make the kebabs:  Force a skewer through the center of an onion slice, a bay leaf, and a veal roll.  Repeat, in the same order, 2 more times.  Finish each kebab with 1 last bay leaf and onion slice.  Make sure all the ingredients are pressed snugly together.

Brush the kebabs with extra-virgin olive oil and cook over a preheated grill or broiled until tender and golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.

To serve, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon.

Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- for pasta water
     1/2           cup  fresh picked mint leaves
     1/2           cup  fennel fronds
     1/2           cup  fresh picked basil leaves
  1                cup  fresh picked parsley
  2                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  salt packed capers -- soaked, rinsed,
                        and drained
  4             medium  plum tomatoes -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  ziti
  1                cup  freshly grated locatelli pecorino
