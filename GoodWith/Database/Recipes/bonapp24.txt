                             Andouille Grits

Recipe By     :Chef Tory McPhail, Commander's Palace, New Orleans, LA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  8             ounces  andouille sausage or hot links -- cut small cubes
  3 3/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  1                cup  instant grits

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add sausage and sautÈ until brown, about 3 minutes.

Add 3 3/4 cups broth and bring to boil.  Gradually whisk in grits.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Mix in more broth by 1/4 cupfuls to thin, if desired.  Stir in remaining 3 tablespoons butter.  Season grits to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chef Tory McPhail writes: "I was 19 years old and just out of culinary school when I first started at Commander's Palace.  Despite my training, nothing prepared me for the pressures of working in a fast-paced kitchen, or in a restaurant of such high quality.  I think my success came down to sheer effort and a lifelong passion for cooking.  Even as a kid I loved playing with cookie and pie dough.

"After a seven-year absence, which I spent working abroad and opening a new Commander's Palace restaurant in Las Vegas, I came back to New Orleans last year.  Since returning I've enjoyed cooking for my friends.  On the weekends we'll go fishing, and then I'll grill our catch and serve it along with a fresh salad.  That meal combines the two best things about living in the South ó lots of fishing and great fresh produce."

Serve these creamy grits with fried eggs for a southern-style breakfast.  Andouille, a spicy pork sausage, is available at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  Braeburn or Fuji apples - (abt 6 medium) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/4           cups  unsalted butter - (2 1/2 sticks)
     1/3           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  28                    fresh 13" by 9" phyllo pastry sheets - (ab
                        = (or frozen phylo, thawed)
  1 1/4           cups  lightly-toasted fresh breadcrumbs
                        Vanilla ice cream

Mix apple cubes and lemon juice in medium bowl.  Mix 1 cup sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and white pepper in small bowl to blend.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat and stir constantly until butter browns, about 3 minutes.  Add 1/3 cup water, then sugar mixture and cook until syrup turns deep amber color, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes.

Mix in brown sugar and stir until dissolved.  Add apple cubes with lemon juice; cook until juices are thick and spoon leaves path when drawn across bottom of pan, about 13 minutes.  Add molasses and stir to blend.

Divide apple mixture equally between two 14-cube ice-cube trays.  Freeze until frozen, at least 4 hours.  (Frozen apple cubes can be prepared 1 month ahead.  Cover; keep frozen.)

Melt remaining 1 cup butter in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stack 14 phyllo sheets on work surface.  Trim phyllo stack to form 13- by 8-inch rectangle.  Cut stack in half lengthwise, forming two 13- by 4-inch stacks; place on top of each other.  Cover with plastic wrap, then damp kitchen towel.  Repeat with remaining 14 phyllo sheets, forming second stack.

Place 1 phyllo strip on work surface.  Brush lightly with melted butter.  Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon breadcrumbs.  Top with second phyllo strip.  Brush lightly with melted butter; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon breadcrumbs.

Remove 1 frozen apple cube from ice-cube tray; return remaining cubes to freezer.  Place frozen apple cube on lower short end of prepared phyllo strip.  Turn bottom right corner of strip over apple cube so that bottom edge lines up with left side.  Continue folding up phyllo, flag-style, creating triangle and enclosing apple cube.  Brush triangle with melted butter; place on rimmed baking sheet and transfer to freezer.  Repeat with remaining pastry strips and apple cubes.  (Turnovers can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cover; keep frozen.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake strudel turnovers on rimmed baking sheets until golden brown, about 13 minutes.  Serve strudel turnovers warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  The pastry chefs at Spago make fresh strudel dough, but we call for packaged phyllo here.  For the breadcrumbs, finely grind crustless white sandwich bread in a processor, then toast the crumbs in a 350 degree oven until dry, about 10 minutes.  You'll need two 14-cube ice-cube trays for the filling.

Mix apple cubes and lemon juice in medium bowl.  Mix 1 cup sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and white pepper in small bowl to blend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat and stir constantly until butter browns, about 3 minutes.  Add 1/3 cup water, then sugar mixture and cook until syrup turns deep amber color, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix in brown sugar and stir until dissolved.  Add apple cubes with lemon juice; cook until juices are thick and spoon leaves path when drawn across bottom of pan, about 13 minutes.  Add molasses and stir to blend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide apple mixture equally between two 14-cube ice-cube trays.  Freeze until frozen, at least 4 hours.  (Frozen apple cubes can be prepared 1 month ahead.  Cover; keep frozen.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt remaining 1 cup butter in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stack 14 phyllo sheets on work surface.  Trim phyllo stack to form 13- by 8-inch rectangle.  Cut stack in half lengthwise, forming two 13- by 4-inch stacks; place on top of each other.  Cover with plastic wrap, then damp kitchen towel.  Repeat with remaining 14 phyllo sheets, forming second stack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 phyllo strip on work surface.  Brush lightly with melted butter.  Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon breadcrumbs.  Top with second phyllo strip.  Brush lightly with melted butter; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon breadcrumbs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove 1 frozen apple cube from ice-cube tray; return remaining cubes to freezer.  Place frozen apple cube on lower short end of prepared phyllo strip.  Turn bottom right corner of strip over apple cube so that bottom edge lines up with left side.  Continue folding up phyllo, flag-style, creating triangle and enclosing apple cube.  Brush triangle with melted butter; place on rimmed baking sheet and transfer to freezer.  Repeat with remaining pastry strips and apple cubes.  (Turnovers can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cover; keep frozen.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake strudel turnovers on rimmed baking sheets until golden brown, about 13 minutes.  Serve strudel turnovers warm with vanilla ice cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The pastry chefs at Spago make fresh strudel dough, but we call for packaged phyllo here.  For the breadcrumbs, finely grind crustless white sandwich bread in a processor, then toast the crumbs in a 350 degree oven until dry, about 10 minutes.  You&apos;ll need two 14-cube ice-cube trays for the filling.

       Arctic Char With Horseradish Cream, Beets, Dandelion Greens

Recipe By     :Chef Michael Cimarusti
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HORSERADISH CREAM ===
  3               cups  cubed (1/2") peeled fresh horseradish root
                        = (from 1 lb unpeeled)
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream
                        === BEETS ===
  8                     baby red beets
  8                     baby golden beets
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar
  4        tablespoons  sugar
                        === FISH AND GREENS ===
  4                     arctic char or salmon fillets - (6 oz ea) -- with skin
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     large bunch dandelion greens -- stems trimmed

For Horseradish Cream:  Grate horseradish in processor fitted with coarse-shredder disk.  Transfer horseradish to medium saucepan.  Add cream.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Let stand, covered, 30 minutes to infuse.  Strain cream into small saucepan, pressing firmly on solids.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Beets:  Cook red and golden beets in separate medium pots of boiling salted water until tender, about 18 minutes.  Drain and cool.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Peel red beets; cut each in half and place in medium skillet.  Peel golden beets; cut each in half and place in another medium skillet.  Mix 1/2 cup vinegar and 2 tablespoons sugar into each skillet.  Cook beets in each skillet over medium-high heat until liquid thickens to syrup and begins to coat beets, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Season beets with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat.

For Fish And Greens:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over high heat.  Add fish, skin-side down.  Sear until skin is brown and crisp, about 3 minutes.  Place skillet with fish in oven.  Roast fish until barely opaque in center, about 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, warm horseradish cream over medium heat.  Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add greens and sautÈ until just wilted, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide greens among 4 plates.  Top greens with fish, skin-side up.  Surround fish with beets.  Spoon warm horseradish cream over and drizzle with beet juices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Salmon fillets can be substituted for the char.  For a shortcut version of the horseradish cream, just mix 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream with prepared white horseradish to taste.

  6        tablespoons  chilled butter - (3/4 stick)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil

     3/4           cup  Sherry wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin

Comments:  Drained nonfat yogurt ó rather than mayonnaise or sour cream ó provides the creamy texture.  Start making this dip a day ahead, and try it with apple or pear slices.

     1/2           cup  dried porcini mushrooms
  2              large  oranges

  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  finely-chopped onions
  6                     lamb shanks - (1 lb ea)
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        = (such as Barolo)
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  8               cups  low-salt chicken broth
                        Soft Polenta With Bay Leaves -- (see recipe)

Combine 2 cups hot water and mushrooms in small bowl.  Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 30 minutes.

Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from oranges in long strips.  Squeeze juice from oranges; reserve peel and juice.  Tie bay leaves, rosemary sprigs, and cloves in square of moistened cheesecloth.

Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in wide pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions; sautÈ until golden, about 12 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer onions to small bowl.

Add 2 tablespoons oil to pot.  Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper.  Add 3 lamb shanks to pot.  SautÈ until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to plate.  Repeat with remaining shanks.

Return onions to pot.  Using slotted spoon, add mushrooms, then mushroom soaking liquid, leaving any sediment in bowl.  Add orange peel and juice, herb bundle, wine, and tomato paste.  Boil 5 minutes, scraping up browned bits.

Return lamb to pot, arranging in single layer.  Add broth; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover; simmer 30 minutes.  Partially uncover pot.  Simmer until lamb is tender, turning every 15 minutes, about 1 1/2 hours longer.

Transfer lamb to bowl.  Tilt pot and spoon fat off top of sauce.  Boil until sauce is thick enough to coat spoon lightly and is reduced to 5 cups, about 35 minutes.  Discard herb bundle and orange peel.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Return lamb to pot, spooning sauce over to coat.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate lamb, uncovered, until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.  Rewarm over low heat before continuing.)

Spoon polenta onto large platter.  Arrange lamb atop polenta.  Spoon sauce over lamb and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Dried porcini mushrooms are available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and many supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARBANZO BEANS ===
  1 1/2           cups  dried garbanzo beans
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
  1                     celery stalk -- halved
  1             medium  carrot -- halved
  4              large  fresh rosemary sprigs
  4              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  raisins
                        === SHORT RIBS ===
  8                     meaty short ribs - (3" to 4" long)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1              small  carrot -- chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  5              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  3                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  Sherry wine vinegar
  2                     fresh tarragon sprigs
  8                     hot cherry peppers from jar -- drained, left whole

For Garbanzo Beans:  Place beans in large saucepan.  Add cold water to cover by 2 inches and bring to boil.  Remove from heat; cover and let stand 1 hour.

Drain beans.  Heat oil in same pan over medium-high heat.  Add onion, celery, and carrot; sautÈ until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add rosemary and thyme.  Return beans to pan.  Add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches and bring to boil.

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer beans uncovered until almost tender, about 45 minutes.  Add 1 teaspoon salt.  Continue to simmer until beans are tender, stirring occasionally and adding more water to keep covered if necessary, about 45 minutes longer.  Add raisins; season beans with pepper.  Cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Short Ribs:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Sprinkle short ribs on all sides with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large wide ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Add short ribs in single layer and brown on all sides, about 12 minutes.  Transfer ribs to plate.

Add onion, carrot, celery, 2 thyme sprigs, and garlic to pot.  SautÈ until vegetables brown, about 10 minutes.  Return ribs to pot in single layer, meat-side down.  Add broth, vinegar, tarragon sprigs, and remaining 3 thyme sprigs and bring to simmer (broth will not cover ribs).  Bake uncovered until ribs are tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes.

Using oven mitts, transfer short ribs to stove top.  Tilt pot; spoon off fat from surface.  Drain bean-raisin mixture.  Add cherry peppers and drained bean-raisin mixture.  Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  One of the pleasures of a dish like this is sopping up the wonderful sauce with crusty bread; make sure to have plenty on hand.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic; sautÈ until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add barley; stir until coated with butter, about 1 minute.  Add 1/2 cup broth; simmer, stirring often, until broth is absorbed, about 3 minutes.  Add remaining broth 1/2 cup at a time, allowing broth to be absorbed before adding more and stirring frequently until barley is tender but still firm to bite and risotto is creamy, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, herbs, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to risotto; stir to combine.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Divide risotto among bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  In this recipe from Rick Tramonto, chef at Tru in Chicago, chewy pearl barley meets silky European butter in an outstanding alternative to arborio rice risotto.  For best results, use Parmigiano-Reggiano.

                Pork                            Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  apple cider vinegar
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  dried crushed red pepper
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     bag charcoal briquettes - (10 lbs)
  6               cups  hickory-wood chips - (about) -- soaked in cold
                        water 30 minutes, drained
  2                     untrimmed boneless pork shoulder halves
                        = (Boston butt; abt 7 lbs)
  12                    hamburger buns -- split

Combine first 8 ingredients in heavy large saucepan.  Simmer over medium heat 5 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 2 hours.

Place handful of torn newspaper in bottom of charcoal chimney.  Top with 30 charcoal briquettes.  Remove top rack from grill.  Place chimney on lower grill rack.  Light newspaper; let charcoal burn until ash is gray, about 30 minutes.

Open bottom grill vent.  Turn hot charcoal onto 1/2 of bottom rack.  Using metal spatula, spread charcoal to cover approximately 1/3 of rack.  Fill 2 small foil loaf pans halfway with water and place next to charcoal on bottom rack.  Sprinkle 1 cup chips over coals.

Place top rack on grill.  Arrange pork shoulder halves on top rack above loaf pans.  Cover grill with lid, positioning top vent directly over pork.  Place stem of meat thermometer in top vent with gauge on outside and tip near roast (thermometer should not touch meat or grill rack); leave in place during cooking.  Use top and bottom vents to maintain temperature between 250 and 325 degrees, opening vent wider to increase heat and closing to decrease heat.  Leave other vents closed.  Check temperature every 20 minutes.

Cook pork 3 hours.  About once an hour, light more charcoal in chimney set on bricks or cement to replenish charcoal in grill.  Add 12 hot ash-tinged briquettes and 1 cup drained wood chips when cooking temperature drops below 250 degrees.  Using sharp knife, make several crosswise slashes in meat (do not cut through).  Brush with some of sauce.  Cover and continue cooking pork until meat thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 165 degrees, about 2 1/2 hours longer, adding additional hot briquettes and chips as necessary to maintain temperature and basting occasionally with sauce.

Transfer pork to cutting board; remove any tough rind.  Chop meat into bite-size pieces.  Transfer meat to large bowl and add enough sauce to moisten.  Arrange bun bottoms on work surface.  Top buns with pork; cover with tops.  Serve, passing additional sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  While our directions call for lighting the grill with a charcoal chimney, feel free to use whatever method you prefer.

  2 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  8                     chamomile tea bags
  8              large  egg yolks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HERB-ROASTED TOMATOES ===
  9              large  plum tomatoes -- halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        === OLIVE BROTH ===
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped onion
  1 1/2           cups  chopped fresh fennel bulb
  3 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh spinach - (packed)
  1                cup  chopped Kalamata olives - (abt 4 1/2 oz)
                        ===
  6                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin
                        Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Chives -- (see recipe)

For Herb-Roasted Tomatoes:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place tomatoes, cut-side up, on rimmed baking sheet.  Brush tomatoes with oil.  Mix parsley, basil, rosemary, and thyme in bowl.  Sprinkle half of herb mixture over tomatoes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Roast tomatoes until tender and slightly brown around edges, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining herbs.

Meanwhile, prepare Olive Broth:  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and fennel and sautÈ until onions are translucent, about 6 minutes.  Add chicken broth and boil until mixture is reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 13 minutes.  Add spinach and olives to broth and cook 1 minute.  Strain through fine sieve; discard solids.  Season broth to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm.

Brush chicken with 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat; add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.  Reduce heat to medium and sautÈ until chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes longer.

Spoon mashed potatoes onto center of each of 6 plates, dividing equally.  Top with tomatoes, then chicken.  Spoon broth around potatoes on each plate.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Suzanne Rushing of Cannon Beach, Oregon, writes: "On a recent trip to St. Louis, my husband and I went to Harvest restaurant twice because we were so impressed with the food.  I would love to have the recipe for chef Stephen Gontram's wonderful chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and herb-roasted tomatoes."

The clear olive broth, flavored with fennel, spinach, and olives, makes a delicious sauce for this dish of chicken, potatoes, and roasted tomatoes.

                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  4          teaspoons  lightly-salted roasted cashews - -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chopped lightly-salted roasted cashews
                        === GINGER-CITRUS CARAMEL SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2           cup  strained orange juice
  1              piece  peeled fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- grated, pressed
                        through garlic press to
                        extract 1/2 tspn juice
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1              large  banana -- sliced

* Note:  Brown star-shaped seedpods sold at Asian markets, at specialty foods stores, and in the spice section of some supermarkets.

For Crust:  Sift flour and cocoa into small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat powdered sugar and butter in medium bowl until well blended.  Beat in flour mixture.  Beat in egg yolks 1 at a time.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.  Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using 5-inch-diameter plate or bowl as guide, cut out rounds.  Reroll dough scraps if necessary to form four 5-inch rounds total.  Press each dough round onto bottom and up sides of 4 1/4- to 4 1/2-inch-diameter tartlet pan with removable bottom.  Pierce crusts all over with fork.  Freeze crusts 10 minutes.  Bake until firm to touch and beginning to pull away from sides of pans, about 15 minutes.  Cool crusts completely in pans on rack.

For Caramel Filling:  Combine sugar and next 3 ingredients in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 7 minutes.  Remove from heat; add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Stir over low heat until any caramel bits dissolve and caramel is smooth.  Whisk in butter.  Set aside.

For Chocolate Ganache Topping:  Bring cream and corn syrup to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Add star anise; remove from heat.  Cover; let steep 15 minutes.  Discard star anise.  Return mixture to boil.  Remove from heat.  Add 4 1/2 ounces coarsely chopped bittersweet chocolate and butter; whisk ganache topping until smooth.

Stir 1 ounce finely chopped bittersweet chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted.  Brush inside of each crust with melted chocolate, then sprinkle each with 1 generous teaspoon chopped cashews.  Spoon caramel filling over nuts in crusts (about 2 tablespoons for each).  Chill tartlets until caramel sets slightly, about 30 minutes.

Rewarm chocolate ganache topping just until pourable, if necessary.  Spoon chocolate ganache atop caramel filling.  Refrigerate just until ganache sets, about 45 minutes, then let tartlets stand at room temperature.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover tartlets loosely and let stand at room temperature.)

For Ginger-Citrus Caramel Sauce:  Stir 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until medium (not deep) amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; slowly add orange juice and 1/2 teaspoon ginger juice.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean.  Return mixture to boil, stirring until any caramel bits dissolve.  Boil until sauce is slightly syrupy and reduced to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm over low heat just until pourable.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat.  Add brown sugar; whisk until blended, about 1 minute.  Add banana slices and toss to coat.  Transfer banana mixture to small baking sheet.  Bake until bananas begin to brown slightly around edges and sugar mixture bubbles, about 4 minutes.

Remove sides from tartlet pans.  Place tartlets on plates.  Drizzle ginger caramel sauce around tartlets.  Arrange banana slices alongside.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cashews and serve.

This recipe yields 4 tartlets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- frozen, diced
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4        tablespoons  ice water - (about)
                        ===
  1                     egg white -- beaten to blend
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  hot water
     1/2      teaspoon  instant espresso powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4           cup  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        ===
                        Powdered sugar
                        Vanilla ice cream

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor 5 seconds.  Add shortening and butter.  Using on/off turns, blend until coarse meal forms.  Add 3 tablespoons ice water; blend briefly.  Add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time, and blend, using on/off turns, until moist clumps form.  Gather dough together; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 3/4 inch.  Fold overhang under and crimp edge decoratively.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Freeze 10 minutes.

Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides are set, about 25 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake crust until beginning to color, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer.  Remove from oven; brush crust with some of egg white to seal.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, prepare Filling:  Mix flour and brown sugar in medium bowl.  Add butter; cut in with back of fork until blended and even-size crumbs form.  Combine 1 cup hot water and espresso powder in another medium bowl.  Add baking soda.  Whisk in corn syrup, molasses, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon.

Sprinkle crumb mixture over hot crust.  Pour in molasses mixture.  Bake pie until filling is set in center, about 35 minutes.  Transfer pie to rack; cool completely.

Sift powdered sugar over pie.  Cut into wedges and serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  As the pie bakes, the filling separates into a soft pudding-like bottom and a cakey top.

                          Cream Of Broccoli Soup

Recipe By     :Chef Ludovic LeFebvre, Ludo, Santa Monica, CA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  broccoli florets - (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  whipping cream -- plus
  4          teaspoons  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Cook broccoli in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still bright green, about 5 minutes.  Drain broccoli.  Set aside 4 small florets for garnish.

Combine broth and 1 cup cream in heavy large saucepan and bring to boil.  Working in batches, puree broccoli, broth mixture, and butter in blender until smooth, about 45 seconds per batch.  Return puree to same pan.  Season soup to taste with salt and white pepper.  (Soup can be made up to 8 hours ahead.  Cool slightly, cover, and refrigerate.)

Bring soup to simmer, thinning with water if desired.  Ladle soup into 4 bowls.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon cream over each; garnish with reserved florets.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chef Ludovic LeFebvre writes: "I'm looking forward to the opening of my restaurant, Ludo, this fall.  It's going to be different from the elaborate French cuisine I've done in the past: People are interested in lighter and healthier foods now, and I want my cooking to reflect that.  For me, that means using the best ingredients in simple ways.

"Before coming to America, I apprenticed with some of France's best chefs, like Marc Meneau and Alain Passard.  I was lucky to have such great teachers, but after two years of working 17-hour days, it was time for a change.  Moving to Los Angeles definitely altered my work habits.  My days in the kitchen are shorter, and there's more opportunity to enjoy cooking at home."

This rich and creamy soup is elegant enough for company.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  9              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  6          teaspoons  sugar
  2               cups  mixed berries
                        = (such as raspberries, blueberries, and
                        sliced strawberries)
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  raspberry liqueur -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place cream in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.

Whisk yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in medium metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bowl to touch water).  Whisk vigorously until yolk mixture is pale yellow and hot to touch, about 3 minutes.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture; discard vanilla bean.

Divide cream mixture among six 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes or custard cups.  Arrange dishes in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of dishes.  Bake custards until almost set in center and light golden on top, about 35 minutes.  Remove custards from water; refrigerate overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar atop each custard.  Place dishes on small baking sheet.  Broil until sugar just starts to caramelize, rotating sheet for even browning, about 2 minutes.  Refrigerate custards until topping hardens, at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.

Meanwhile, toss berries, brown sugar, and raspberry liqueur, if desired, in large bowl.  Spoon berry mixture atop custards and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === BUTTERCREAM ===
  8             ounces  imported milk chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
                        === COFFEE MOUSSE ===
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder
                        = (or coffee powder)
  4              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin -- softened in
  1         tablespoon  water -- for 10 minutes
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides; line bottoms with parchment paper rounds.  Dust pans with flour; tap out excess.

Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until melted and smooth.  Remove from over water.  Cool to lukewarm.

Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla in large bowl to blend.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl.  Gradually beat in lukewarm melted chocolate.  Beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.  Gradually beat in crËme de cacao and coffee.  Divide batter evenly between prepared pans; smooth tops.

Bake cakes until toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Invert cakes onto 9-inch cardboard rounds or removable tart pan bottoms; cool cakes completely on racks.

For Buttercream:  Melt milk chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Remove from over water.

Whisk sugar, egg yolks, 2 tablespoons water, and corn syrup in medium metal bowl to blend.  Add 1/4 cup butter.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; whisk constantly until mixture reaches 170 degrees, about 4 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat until completely cool and thick, about 6 minutes.  Gradually beat in 1/2 cup butter, about 1 tablespoon at a time, fully incorporating each addition and stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl.  Beat in lukewarm melted chocolate.

For Coffee Mousse:  Bring half-and-half, 2 tablespoons sugar, and espresso powder to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Whisk egg yolks and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk hot half-and-half mixture into yolk mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan and stir constantly over medium heat until thermometer registers 160 degrees, about 2 minutes.  Pour into large bowl.  Add softened gelatin; stir until dissolved.  Using electric mixer, beat until cool, about 10 minutes.  Using clean dry beaters, beat cream and vanilla in medium bowl until stiff peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into coffee mixture.

Cut each cake layer horizontally in half.  Place 1 cake layer in bottom of 9-inch-diameter springform pan.  Cover with 3/4 cup buttercream.  Place second cake layer atop buttercream; cover with mousse.  Top with third cake layer.  Refrigerate 1 hour to allow mousse to set.  Spread 3/4 cup buttercream over third cake layer.  Top with fourth cake layer (cake will rise above rim of pan).  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

For Chocolate Glaze:  Stir sugar and 1 cup water in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high; bring to boil.  Whisk in cocoa; remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until smooth.  Let stand until cool but still pourable, about 2 hours.

Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake.  Release pan sides.  Scrape excess mousse from sides of cake.  Transfer cake on springform pan bottom to rack set over baking sheet.  Pour glaze over cake, allowing glaze to drip down edges onto baking sheet (use spatula to spread glaze over any uncovered spots).  Refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow glaze to set.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Melissa Harden of Omaha, Nebraska, writes: "To celebrate our recent engagement, my fiancÈ and I spent a long weekend at the Mondrian in Los Angeles.  Our stay was perfect, as was dinner at the hotel's Asia de Cuba restaurant, where I couldn't get enough of the rich Cuban Opera cake."

A traditional Opera cake is made from very thin layers of cake, coffee buttercream, and coffee mousse ó all covered with chocolate glaze.  This version, which is perfect for a special occasion, is taller than your average Opera cake, owing to its thicker layers.

Top with fourth cake layer (cake will rise above rim of pan).  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

For Chocolate Glaze:  Stir sugar and 1 cup water in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high; bring to boil.  Whisk in cocoa; remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until smooth.  Let stand until cool but still pourable, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake.  Release pan sides.  Scrape excess mousse from sides of cake.  Transfer cake on springform pan bottom to rack set over baking sheet.  Pour glaze over cake, allowing glaze to drip down edges onto baking sheet (use spatula to spread glaze over any uncovered spots).  Refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow glaze to set.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

Comments:  Melissa Harden of Omaha, Nebraska, writes: &quot;To celebrate our recent engagement, my fiancÈ and I spent a long weekend at the Mondrian in Los Angeles.  Our stay was perfect, as was dinner at the hotel&apos;s Asia de Cuba restaurant, where I couldn&apos;t get enough of the rich Cuban Opera cake.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
A traditional Opera cake is made from very thin layers of cake, coffee buttercream, and coffee mousse ó all covered with chocolate glaze.  This version, which is perfect for a special occasion, is taller than your average Opera cake, owing to its thicker layers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (4 to 5 lbs) -- thawed if frozen,
                        excess fat removed, backbone removed,
                        duck quartered
  3          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted wild mushrooms -- cut 1" pieces
                        = (such as chanterelle, oyster, and
                        stemmed shiitake)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
  7                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             bottle  stout - (12 oz)
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  4          teaspoons  Emeril's Original Essence*
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  5               cups  freshly-cooked white rice
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley

* Note:  A dried herb and spice blend available at some specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.  A combination of 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne can be substituted.

Heat heavy large pot over medium-high heat until hot, about 3 minutes.  Sprinkle duck with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Add to pot, skin-side down, and sear until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side.  Using tongs, transfer duck to plate.

Add vegetable oil, then flour to drippings in pot; stir with wooden spoon to blend well.  Reduce heat to medium and stir constantly until roux is chocolate-brown color, about 25 minutes.  (If roux is still light brown after 20 minutes, increase heat to medium-high for final 5 minutes.)

Add mushrooms, onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic to roux and cook until mushrooms and vegetables are soft, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes.  Add stout; stir to blend.  Add chicken broth, Emeril's Original Essence, bay leaves, thyme, cayenne, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt; stir to blend well.

Return duck pieces to pot.  Increase heat and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered until duck is tender, skimming foam from surface and stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.

Using tongs, transfer duck to plate; cool until easy to handle, about 20 minutes.  Remove meat from bones; discard bones and skin.  Cut meat into 1-inch pieces.  Spoon fat off top of gumbo.  Return meat to gumbo; season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold.  Cover and keep refrigerated.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Divide cooked white rice among 10 bowls.  Ladle gumbo over.  Sprinkle with green onions and parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  A refined version of a New Orleans classic.  Ask the butcher to remove the backbone and quarter the duck.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES ===
  6                     plum tomatoes -- cored, halved
                        lengthwise, and seeded
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        === SKORDALIA ===
  1                     garlic head
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" cubes
  6        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
  1                cup  sliced almonds -- toasted, cooled,
                        and finely ground
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        === EGGPLANT ===
  18            slices  eggplant -- 1/4"-thk rounds
                        = (cut from 1 large eggplant)
  4               cups  whole milk
  6              large  egg whites
  2               cups  dry breadcrumbs
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
     3/4           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
  1                cup  oil-cured olives

For Tomatoes:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix all ingredients in large bowl.  Arrange tomatoes, cut-side down, on prepared baking sheet; drizzle any remaining mixture from bowl over tomatoes.  Bake 1 hour; turn tomatoes over and bake until slightly dried but still tender, about 1 hour longer.  Peel skin off warm tomatoes.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cool, then cover and refrigerate.)

For Skordalia:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut top 1/2 inch off garlic head, exposing cloves.  Place garlic in small ovenproof dish; drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Cover tightly with foil and bake until cloves are soft, about 50 minutes.  Cool.  Squeeze garlic head from bottom to release garlic from skins.

Cook potatoes in medium saucepan of simmering salted water until tender when pierced with fork, about 12 minutes; drain.  Bring cream and butter to simmer in large saucepan.  Remove from heat; whisk in sour cream.  Add potatoes to cream mixture and mash.  Mix roasted garlic, ground almonds, lemon juice, and minced fresh garlic into potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm before using.)

For Eggplant:  Soak eggplant slices in milk in large bowl 1 hour.  Drain; pat dry.  Sprinkle eggplant lightly with salt.  Whisk egg whites in medium bowl until frothy.  Dredge eggplant in egg whites, then breadcrumbs, coating completely; place on baking sheet.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Heat vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, add eggplant slices to skillet and fry until golden, about 2 minutes per side.  Using slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place 1 tablespoon skordalia in center of each of 6 plates.  Top skordalia with 1 eggplant slice, 1 tablespoon skordalia, 1 tablespoon sliced basil, 1 oven-dried tomato half, 1 eggplant slice, 1 tablespoon skordalia, 1 tablespoon basil, 1 oven-dried tomato half, and 1 more eggplant slice.  Garnish with olives and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Skordalia is a garlicky Greek dip made with mashed or pureed potatoes.

Comments:  Peg Isherwood of Libertyville, Illinois, writes: "While in Christiansted, St. Croix, we dined at Kendrick's and had the most interesting gazpacho ó it was spicy but not too hot, with lots of chopped vegetables.  I met the owner, David Kendrick, the next morning and found him delightful.  Would you ask him for the recipe?"

This gazpacho has a chunkier texture than most (almost like a salsa).  To chop the vegetables in a processor, cut them into quarters and process in batches, using on/off turns.

                        Leek-Tomato Quinoa -- (see recipe)
                        Chopped fresh chives

For Sauce:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine milk and garlic in small saucepan.  Simmer, uncovered, over medium heat 10 minutes.  Drain; discard milk.

Place garlic heads, cut-side up, in small ovenproof dish.  Pour 1/2 cup oil over.  Cover dish tightly with foil.  Bake until garlic is soft, about 55 minutes.  Remove garlic from oil; cool.

Pour oil from dish into measuring cup; add more oil if necessary to measure 1/2 cup total.  Squeeze out garlic from peel into blender.  Add 1/2 cup broth and garlic oil; puree until smooth, thinning with more broth if desired.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Rewarm over medium-low heat and thin with more broth, if desired, before serving.)

For Beef:  Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Rub beef all over with oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill beef to desired doneness, turning often, about 22 minutes for medium-rare.  Remove from grill and let stand 5 minutes.  Cut beef crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.

Spoon Leek-Tomato Quinoa onto 4 plates.  Top with beef, sauce, and chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Charmaine Haravey of Niwot, Colorado, writes: "I love spending my days in the mountains.  It's one of the reasons that I moved to Boulder County.  But since I started my new job, I don't have as much time to hike, ski, or enjoy my other favorite activity ó cooking.  Spending time in the kitchen has now become a luxury.  Instead of making a complete meal in the evening, I prepare 'single-girl food' ó namely cookies, grilled sandwiches, and egg dishes.  But I don't use that expression negatively.  For me, grilled cheese sandwiches are the ultimate comfort food."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water

* Note:  Available at some natural foods stores and Italian markets; or it can be ordered from Dean & DeLuca, 800-221-7714.

Bring 4 cups water and farro to boil in medium saucepan over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Drain.  Mix farro, 7 tablespoons oil, parsley, currants, onions, vinegar, shallot, and half of garlic in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Mix remaining 5 tablespoons oil and remaining garlic in small bowl.  Brush garlic oil evenly over both sides of mushrooms.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill mushrooms until tender, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Place mushrooms, gill-side up, on platter.  Mix nuts into farro; spoon atop mushrooms.  Garnish with sprouts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Peyton Hughes of Iowa City, Iowa, writes: "My extended family met for a reunion in Boston a few months ago.  For our last night together, we decided it would be appropriate to have dinner at Finale.  I'll never forget the unusual grilled portobello salad."

Farro, or spelt, is a cereal grain that's been eaten in southern Europe for ages.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise -- plus
  1         tablespoon  mayonnaise
  6                     green onions - (2 minced, and
                        remaining 4 cut into 4" lengths)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley - (packed)
  1 1/4         pounds  skinless salmon fillets -- cut 1" cubes
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
                        = (or fresh breadcrumbs made from
                        crustless French bread)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Combine remaining 4 green onions and chopped parsley in food processor; blend until finely chopped.  Add cubed salmon, Dijon mustard, and remaining 1 tablespoon mayonnaise.  Using on/off turns, blend until salmon is coarsely chopped.  Transfer salmon mixture to large bowl.

Mix in breadcrumbs, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper.  With moistened hands and using about 1/3 cupful for each, shape salmon mixture into 8 patties, each about 1/2 inch thick.  Brush both sides of salmon cakes with olive oil.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Grill salmon cakes to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium.  Divide patties among 4 plates.  Serve lemon mayonnaise alongside.

This recipe yields 8 cakes.

Comments:  Mary deMuth of Rowlett, Texas, writes: "Because my husband is in a graduate program, we've been able to meet people from all over the world.  It has been a great experience for our three children ó and a chance for me to add to my recipe collection.  We frequently have other students over for dinner, so I'm always learning new dishes.  Next year our family will be moving to southern France, and we're very excited about the food we'll have there.  We hope to make many new friends who will share their ProvenÁal specialties. "

Try these on grilled buns for a "burger" variation.  Panko is available in the Asian foods section of most supermarkets.

Comments:  Chef Ludovic LeFebvre writes: "I'm looking forward to the opening of my restaurant, Ludo, this fall.  It's going to be different from the elaborate French cuisine I've done in the past: People are interested in lighter and healthier foods now, and I want my cooking to reflect that.  For me, that means using the best ingredients in simple ways.

"Before coming to America, I apprenticed with some of France's best chefs, like Marc Meneau and Alain Passard.  I was lucky to have such great teachers, but after two years of working 17-hour days, it was time for a change.  Moving to Los Angeles definitely altered my work habits.  My days in the kitchen are shorter, and there's more opportunity to enjoy cooking at home. "

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ===LAMB ===
  3                     racks lamb - (1 1/4 lbs ea) -- frenched
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh mint
                        === PARSLEY SAUTE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  6               cups  fresh Italian parsley leaves - (packed)
                        = (from 2 large bunches)
     3/4           cup  very coarsely-chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/2           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped toasted walnuts - -- (abt 2 1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  walnut oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

For Lamb:  Place lamb racks on heavy large rimmed baking sheet.  Brush lamb with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons coarse salt and pepper.  Mix all herbs in small bowl; press firmly over meat side of lamb to adhere.  Let stand 2 hours at room temperature.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, add lamb, meat-and-herb side down, and cook until brown, about 4 minutes.  Transfer racks to baking sheet, meat-and-herb side up.  Roast lamb until meat thermometer inserted into center registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 13 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Parsley SautÈ:  Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add parsley and sautÈ until wilted, about 2 minutes.  Add mint, 1/2 cup water, and lemon peel and cook until parsley is tender, about 3 minutes.  Mix in walnuts, walnut oil, and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut lamb between bones into individual chops.  Divide parsley sautÈ among 6 plates.  Top with lamb chops and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Have the butcher "french" the lamb racks, which entails trimming the fat from the lamb and between the bones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange-flavored liqueur)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream

Line 12-cup muffin pan with muffin papers.  Combine chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan; stir over medium-low heat until melted and smooth, about 1 minute.  Remove saucepan from heat.

Using electric mixer, beat sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and liqueur in large bowl until thick ribbon falls when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.  Sift flour over; using rubber spatula, gently fold in flour.  Fold in chocolate mixture.  Divide batter among muffin papers.  Cover and chill until cold and firm, at least 25 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake cupcakes in papers on baking sheet until tops are puffed and cracked and tester inserted into center comes out with moist batter attached, about 7 minutes.  Serve cupcakes with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

Comments:  Chef Ludovic leFebvre writes: "I'm looking forward to the opening of my restaurant, Ludo, this fall.  It's going to be different from the elaborate French cuisine I've done in the past: People are interested in lighter and healthier foods now, and I want my cooking to reflect that.  For me, that means using the best ingredients in simple ways.

"Before coming to America, I apprenticed with some of France's best chefs, like Marc Meneau and Alain Passard.  I was lucky to have such great teachers, but after two years of working 17-hour days, it was time for a change.  Moving to Los Angeles definitely altered my work habits.  My days in the kitchen are shorter, and there's more opportunity to enjoy cooking at home."

Ideal for a party, these soft-center soufflÈ cakes can be prepared the night before, then baked in less than ten minutes.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  espresso coffee beans
  1 1/4      teaspoons  whole allspice
     3/4      teaspoon  mustard seeds
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1              bunch  green onions -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  chopped seeded habanero chile
  2 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloins

Stir first 5 ingredients in small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Finely grind spice mixture in spice grinder; transfer to processor.  Add all remaining ingredients except pork; blend until wet paste forms.  Place pork in large glass baking dish and coat with paste.  Cover; chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Transfer pork coated with paste mixture to rimmed baking sheet.  Roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 150 degrees for medium, about 35 minutes.  Slice pork and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Coffee beans soften the heat of the chile and bring out the other flavors in this paste-like marinade.  You can also use the paste on chicken, as they do at Maroons, where this dish is served.  Begin marinating the meat the day before.

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATO SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     anchovy fillets -- finely chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped jalapeÒo chiles -- with seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric - (generous)
  1              large  pinch saffron threads
  1 1/2         pounds  yellow tomatoes -- cored, diced
                        = (abt 3 1/2 cups)
                        === RAVIOLI ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  finely chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped carrot
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                cup  dried French green lentils
  2        tablespoons  chopped seeded jalapeÒo chiles
  1           teaspoon  Hungarian hot paprika
  2 3/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  Sherry wine vinegar
  72                    wonton wrappers - (about)
                        = (from two 12-oz packages)
  2                     egg whites -- beaten to blend
                        === SAUSAGES ===
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  1 1/3           cups  fresh breadcrumbs
  1              pound  fully-cooked smoked sausages -- cut 1/3"-thk slices
                        = (such as cotechino, linguiÁa, or
                        andouille)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

For Sauce:  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until golden, about 12 minutes.  Add garlic, anchovies, jalapeÒos, turmeric, and saffron.  Stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Mix in tomatoes.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until sauce thickens, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; refrigerate.)

For Ravioli:  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until brown, about 8 minutes.  Add carrot, celery, and garlic; sautÈ until vegetables begin to color, about 5 minutes.  Add lentils, jalapeÒos, and paprika; stir to coat.  Add broth and vinegar and bring to boil.

Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until lentils are almost tender, about 1 hour.  Uncover and cook until all broth is absorbed, about 25 minutes longer.  Season lentil mixture with salt and pepper.  Using potato masher, mash mixture coarsely.  Transfer filling to medium bowl and chill until cold, about 30 minutes.

Line 2 large baking sheets with foil or parchment paper.  Working with 2 wonton wrappers at a time, brush each with egg white.  Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of 1 wrapper.  Top with second wrapper, egg white-side down, and seal, pressing out any air.  Cut into round with fluted pastry wheel or 2 3/4-inch-diameter scalloped cookie cutter, if desired.  Place on prepared sheet.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover tightly and refrigerate.)

For Sausages:  Place flour in 1 small bowl, egg in second small bowl, and breadcrumbs in third small bowl.  Dip sausage pieces into flour, then egg, then crumbs to coat.  Place on large plate.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add sausages.  SautÈ until golden, about 4 minutes per side.  Place on baking sheet; keep warm in oven.

Bring large pot of generously salted water to boil.  Cook 1/3 of ravioli until just tender but still firm to bite, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, divide ravioli between 2 shallow bowls; tent with foil to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining ravioli in 2 more batches.  Rewarm sauce; spoon around ravioli.  Top with sausage.

This recipe yields 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  The test kitchen used wonton wrappers instead of homemade pasta to simplify this.

  4              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  3                     garlic cloves -- halved

Bring 8 quarts water and vinegar to boil in 10- to 12-quart pot.  Add 2 lobsters headfirst and cook until shells turn bright red and lobsters are just cooked through, about 11 minutes.  Using tongs, remove lobsters from water.  Repeat with remaining 2 lobsters.

Twist claws and tails off lobsters.  Crack claws and remove meat.  Using kitchen shears or heavy large knife, cut lobster tails lengthwise in half; remove tail meat.  Cut meat into large bite-size pieces.  Place in medium bowl; cover and refrigerate.  Reserve claw and tail shells.

Using kitchen shears, cut away lobster gills.  Rinse shells under cold water.  Place in large bowl.  Pour cold water over and soak 10 minutes.  Drain; rinse well.

Heat 1/4 cup oil in large pot over medium heat.  Add lobster shells, carrots, and next 4 ingredients.  Cook until vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Add 4 quarts water and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Strain lobster broth into large bowl, pressing on solids.  Strain broth again through fine strainer into same pot.  Boil over medium-high heat until broth is reduced to 2 cups, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly; chill broth and lobster meat separately.)

Bring 1 quart water to boil in tea kettle.  Place 2 cups rosemary in each of 4 large bowls; place on table.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 1/4 cup oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms, thyme, and garlic and sautÈ until mushrooms are tender, about 6 minutes; discard thyme and garlic.  Add lobster and 1/2 cup butter to skillet and heat through, about 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring lobster broth to simmer in small saucepan.  Pour hot lobster broth into blender; add 1 cup butter.  Blend until butter is melted and mixture is frothy, about 30 seconds.  Divide lobster mixture among 4 shallow bowls.  Pour butter sauce and foam over lobster mixture and serve.  Pour 1 cup boiling water into each bowl of rosemary to create vapor.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish combines aroma and flavor in a unique fashion: Bowls of steaming rosemary vapor accompany the luxurious main course.  The piney fragrance of fresh rosemary adds another dimension to the taste experience.

Comments:  Mary deMuth of Rowlett, Texas, writes: "Because my husband is in a graduate program, we've been able to meet people from all over the world.  It has been a great experience for our three children ó and a chance for me to add to my recipe collection.  We frequently have other students over for dinner, so I'm always learning new dishes.  Next year our family will be moving to southern France, and we're very excited about the food we'll have there.  We hope to make many new friends who will share their ProvenÁal specialties. "

This side dish is a perfect contribution to any potluck picnic.  Toss in a can of drained tuna for a more substantial salad.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bananas -- peeled, and
                        split lengthwise
  8          teaspoons  dark brown sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  4             slices  purchased banana bread or pound cake -- toasted
  4             scoops  vanilla ice cream
  4             scoops  chocolate ice cream
  4             scoops  chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream
  1                cup  pecans -- toasted
                        Purchased chocolate syrup
                        Sweetened flaked coconut -- toasted

Preheat broiler.  Place banana halves, cut-side up, on baking sheet.  Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon sugar.  Broil bananas until sugar melts and darkens, about 2 minutes.  Set bananas aside.

Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream, dark rum, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl until peaks form.

Place 1 slice banana bread in each of 4 banana split dishes.  Place 1 banana half on each side of bread, parallel to long sides of dish.  Top bread with 1 scoop of each ice cream.  Sprinkle with pecans and drizzle with chocolate syrup.  Top bananas with dollop of rum-whipped cream and sprinkle of coconut.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chef Tory McPhail writes: "I was 19 years old and just out of culinary school when I first started at Commander's Palace.  Despite my training, nothing prepared me for the pressures of working in a fast-paced kitchen, or in a restaurant of such high quality.  I think my success came down to sheer effort and a lifelong passion for cooking.  Even as a kid I loved playing with cookie and pie dough.

"After a seven-year absence, which I spent working abroad and opening a new Commander's Palace restaurant in Las Vegas, I came back to New Orleans last year.  Since returning I've enjoyed cooking for my friends.  On the weekends we'll go fishing, and then I'll grill our catch and serve it along with a fresh salad.  That meal combines the two best things about living in the South ó lots of fishing and great fresh produce."

Grill onion slices until just tender, about 4 minutes per side.  Grill garlic bread until golden, about 1 minute per side.  Place 1 slice grilled bread on each of 4 plates.  Top each with burger and onion slice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve with:  Grilled herbed potato slices and a salad of mixed baby greens and chopped beefsteak tomatoes, dressed with a red-wine vinaigrette.

Dessert:  Purchased plum tart with whipped crËme fraÓche.

  1 3/4         pounds  firm but ripe Bartlett pears - (abt 4 med) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
                        === CUSTARDS ===
  2                     brioche or egg bread loaves - (16 oz ea) -- crusts trimmed,

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  walnuts - (abt 2 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  7        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                     egg yolk
                        === STREUSEL ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  walnuts - (abt 3 oz)
     1/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === FILLING AND TOPPING ===
  8             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese
  8             ounces  whole-milk ricotta cheese - (1 cup)
  3        tablespoons  honey
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  4              large  plums - (abt 1 lb) -- halved, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/4"-thick wedges
                        Fleur de sel*

* Note:  Fleur de sel, a sea salt from Brittany, can be found at specialty foods stores.

For Crust:  Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add butter; blend until coarse meal forms.  Add egg yolk; blend until moist clumps form.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Cover; chill 1 hour.

For Streusel:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Blend flour, walnuts, both sugars, coarse salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add thyme and blend 5 seconds.  Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  Add butter.  Using fingertips, rub in until small moist clumps form.

Spread streusel mixture on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake 8 minutes.  Stir, then continue baking until golden brown, about 7 minutes longer.  Cool streusel completely (mixture will become crisp).

For Filling And Topping:  Combine both cheeses, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, nutmeg, coarse salt, and pepper in large bowl; stir to blend well.  Refrigerate while baking crust.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides are set, about 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Continue to bake crust until golden brown, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 15 minutes longer.  Cool crust completely.

Spread cheese filling in crust.  Arrange plums in concentric circles atop filling, leaving 3/4-inch plain border.  Sprinkle streusel lightly over tart.  Refrigerate tart at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.

Remove pan sides; place tart on platter.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons honey and 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with fleur de sel.  Cut tart into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Adding fleur de sel at the end transforms this tart into a delicious cross between a cheese course and dessert.

For Crust:  Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add butter; blend until coarse meal forms.  Add egg yolk; blend until moist clumps form.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Cover; chill 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Streusel:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Blend flour, walnuts, both sugars, coarse salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add thyme and blend 5 seconds.  Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  Add butter.  Using fingertips, rub in until small moist clumps form.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread streusel mixture on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake 8 minutes.  Stir, then continue baking until golden brown, about 7 minutes longer.  Cool streusel completely (mixture will become crisp).
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling And Topping:  Combine both cheeses, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, nutmeg, coarse salt, and pepper in large bowl; stir to blend well.  Refrigerate while baking crust.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides are set, about 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Continue to bake crust until golden brown, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 15 minutes longer.  Cool crust completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread cheese filling in crust.  Arrange plums in concentric circles atop filling, leaving 3/4-inch plain border.  Sprinkle streusel lightly over tart.  Refrigerate tart at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove pan sides; place tart on platter.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons honey and 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with fleur de sel.  Cut tart into wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Adding fleur de sel at the end transforms this tart into a delicious cross between a cheese course and dessert.

                        Pork Tenderloin Churrasco

Recipe By     :Chef Douglas Rodriguez
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  hot smoked Spanish paprika
                        = (PimentÛn de la Vera)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     pork tenderloins - (16 oz ea) -- trimmed of fat and
                        silver skin membrane
                        Aji Amarillo-Pineapple Salsa -- (see recipe)

Combine oil and paprika in heavy small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat 5 minutes to infuse oil, whisking occasionally.  Cool to room temperature.

Pour oil mixture into blender.  Add garlic, thyme leaves, rosemary, salt, and pepper; blend marinade until herbs are finely chopped.

Cut each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 4 strips.  Place each strip between sheets of waxed paper and pound to 1/3-inch thickness.  Arrange pork strips in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour marinade over and turn to coat pork evenly.  Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Scrape off most of marinade from pork strips.  Grill pork until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.

Arrange 2 pork strips on each of 4 plates.  Spoon pineapple salsa atop pork.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Churrasco is Spanish for grilled steak.  This is Douglas Rodriguez's Argentine interpretation made with pork.  He takes slices of tenderloin and pounds them to approximate the thickness of a skirt steak.  Marinate the tenderloin strips for two to six hours before grilling.

Hot smoked Spanish paprika is available from Tienda.com (888-472-1022; tienda.com).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  apple cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2               cups  fresh rhubarb in 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  dried currants
  2                     pork tenderloins - (16 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Bring first 6 ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes.  Increase heat to medium-high.  Add rhubarb and currants; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer gently until rhubarb is tender, about 5 minutes.  Season chutney with salt.  (Chutney can be made 3 days ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before using.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rub pork with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 150 degrees, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Comments:  The sweet yet tangy chutney lends an exotic flavor to grilled pork ó or chicken or salmon.  The dark brown sugar stands up to the other intense ingredients.

  4          teaspoons  Sherry wine vinegar
  2             ounces  sliced pancetta -- chopped
                        = (Italian bacon cured in salt, is
                        available at Italian markets, some
                        specialty foods stores, and some
                        supermarkets)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh Italian parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh sage
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary
  5             ounces  chicken livers -- coarsely chopped

For Gnocchi:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Pierce potato in several places with fork.  Bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Let stand until just cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.

Peel potato.  Press potato through ricer or food mill or mash in large bowl.  Add flour, egg, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon peel, salt, and pepper and stir just until blended.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; divide into 8 pieces.  Roll 1 dough piece between hands and surface to 15-inch-long rope.  Cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place gnocchi on lightly floured baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Sauce:  Bring 1/2 cup water to boil in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add porcini; let soak until soft, about 20 minutes.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add crimini mushrooms; sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.

Add porcini mushrooms and their soaking liquid, leaving behind any sediment in bowl.  Cook until almost all liquid evaporates, about 1 minute.  Add broth and vinegar.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until reduced to 1 cup liquid, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in 3 tablespoons butter.

Heat heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta; sautÈ until pancetta is crisp, about 2 minutes.  Add shallots, parsley, sage, and rosemary.  SautÈ until shallots are soft, about 5 minutes.  Add liver and sautÈ just until cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Add mushroom mixture.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Add gnocchi and cook until rising to surface, about 2 minutes.  Continue cooking 1 minute longer.  Drain.  Divide gnocchi among 4 plates.  Spoon sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === DUCK CONFIT SAUCE ===
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped

  3        tablespoons  chopped leek
                        = (white and pale green parts)
  2        tablespoons  chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped carrot
     1/2           cup  ruby Port
  6               cups  water
  10             whole  black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        === FARRO RISOTTO ===
  1                cup  farro
                        = (sold at some Italian markets and
                        natural foods stores)
  8               cups  water
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
     2/3           cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        === DUCK BREASTS ===
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  honey
     3/4           cup  assorted chopped nuts
                        = (such as pistachios, hazelnuts, and
                        pecans)
  1              whole  star anise*

* Note:  A brown star-shaped seed pod available at Asian markets and specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.

For Sauce:  Mix first 5 ingredients and duck legs and thighs in bowl.  Cover leg-thigh mixture and breasts and carcasses separately; chill overnight.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Heat duck fat in medium ovenproof pot over medium heat to 200 degrees.  Add duck leg-thigh mixture; transfer to oven and cook until meat falls from bones, about 2 hours.  Allow duck confit to cool 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place duck carcasses in large ovenproof pot; roast uncovered until lightly browned, about 30 minutes.  Transfer pot to stove top.  Add leek and next 3 ingredients and sautÈ over medium-high heat until vegetables are lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Add Port; boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Add 6 cups water; boil gently for 30 minutes.  Add peppercorns; boil broth 10 minutes.  Strain broth; skim fat from surface.  Boil broth in medium saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 30 minutes.  Whisk butter into sauce.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill confit and sauce separately.)

Rewarm duck confit to melt fat; remove duck from fat.  Cut meat from bones and add to sauce.

For Farro Risotto:  Soak farro in cold water 20 minutes.  Drain; rinse.  Bring 8 cups water to boil in medium saucepan.  Add 1/2 cup oil and farro.  Simmer 20 minutes.  Drain in strainer and rinse.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add farro and wine.  Simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Add chicken broth 1 cup at a time and simmer until liquid is absorbed and farro is just tender, stirring frequently, about 14 minutes total.  Stir in cheese and 1 tablespoon butter.  Season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, Prepare Duck Breasts:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Sprinkle duck breasts with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add duck breasts, skin-side down; cook until skin is crisp, about 5 minutes.  Turn duck over.  Cook 1 minute; remove from heat.

Bring honey to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add nuts and star anise; boil until honey is reduced to thick syrup, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.  Spoon honey-nut mixture onto duck breasts.  Cook in oven about 4 minutes for medium-rare.

Rewarm duck confit sauce over low heat.  Divide risotto among 4 plates.  Using slotted spoon, remove duck meat from sauce and spoon over risotto.  Slice breasts diagonally; arrange around risotto.  Drizzle duck with confit sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This impressive dish is served at Le Cirque 2000 in New York.  Order two 5-pound fresh ducklings from a butcher.  Ask the butcher to cut each duck into two boneless breasts, two leg pieces, and two thigh pieces.  Reserve the carcasses for making the sauce.  You will probably need to order the rendered duck fat as well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  6                     bacon slices
  1 2/3           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  chopped smoked ham
  5 1/2    tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
                        === PORK CHOPS ===
  6                     pork rib chops, 3/4" to 1"-thick
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4              large  fresh thyme sprigs
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Serrano ham or prosciutto - -- (abt 2 oz)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        Fleur de sel (French sea salt) -- optional
                        Yukon Gold Potato And Fuji Apple Gratins -- (see recipe)

For Vinaigrette:  Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.  Remove bacon and reserve for another use.  Transfer 1/3 cup bacon drippings to measuring cup (add vegetable oil to measure 1/3 cup if necessary).

Boil broth in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes.  Set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add shallot; sautÈ until tender, about 3 minutes.  Add chopped ham, then brown sugar and vinegar.  Increase heat to medium; stir until mixture is syrupy, about 2 minutes.  Add reduced broth; boil until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.  Pour through strainer into same small saucepan; discard solids in strainer.  Set vinaigrette aside.

For Pork Chops:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Working in batches, add pork chops to skillet; cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.

Transfer to roasting pan large enough to hold chops in single layer.  Add thyme sprigs to pan; place in oven and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into chops registers 150 degrees, about 8 minutes.  Remove from oven; let stand while finishing vinaigrette.

Rewarm vinaigrette over medium heat.  Whisk in bacon drippings and Serrano ham.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place 1 pork chop on each of 6 plates.  Drizzle with melted butter.  Sprinkle with fleur de sel, if desired.  Spoon vinaigrette over.  Serve with potato gratins.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === SAUCE ===
  1                     two-inch square tamarind with seeds*
                        = (from a 7-oz block)
  1                cup  peeled cubed kabocha squash
  4                     dried guajillo chiles*
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  finely chopped lemongrass
                        = (bottom 1 1/2" of about 4 peeled stalks)
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped peeled fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  grated lime peel - (packed)
  1                cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
                        = (found at Asian markets and in the
                        Asian foods section of many supermarkets)
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  36                    snow peas -- strings removed
  12                    asparagus tops - (3" long)
  5                     Thai or Japanese eggplants -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut crosswise 1/2"-thk on diagonal
  3             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        trimmed, crosscut 1/2"-thk on diagonal
  4              heads  baby bok choy -- leaves separated
                        from base
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

* Note:  Tamarind is a legume with large brown seedpods.  The pulp is used in Indian, Thai, Caribbean, and Latin American cooking.  The pulp is sold in block form and is available at Indian markets.

** Note:  Guajillo chiles are maroon-colored, fairly hot dried chiles up to 6 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.  Available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

For Sauce:  Place tamarind square in small bowl.  Cover with boiling water and let stand until pulp softens, breaking apart occasionally with fork, about 45 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer tamarind pulp with seeds to strainer set over medium bowl.  Press pulp through sieve, leaving seeds behind.  Measure 2 teaspoons pulp for sauce (discard remaining pulp).

Cook squash in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain squash.  Return to same saucepan and mash to smooth puree.

Cook guajillo chiles in medium saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain, cool, stem, and seed chiles.  Place chiles in blender.  Add 1/2 cup water, lemongrass, shallot, ginger, garlic, and lime peel.  Puree until chile paste is smooth.

Transfer paste to medium saucepan.  Whisk in coconut milk, fish sauce, brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons tamarind pulp.  Add kabocha squash puree and bring to simmer, whisking often.  Simmer until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors blend, whisking occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Vegetables:  Bring medium pot of water to boil; salt generously.  Add snow peas and cook just until crisp-tender, about 15 seconds.  Using large slotted spoon, transfer peas to colander.  Rinse with cold water and drain well.  Repeat cooking, rinsing, and draining with each remaining vegetable in separate batches in same pot of boiling salted water until vegetables are just crisp-tender, about 1 minute for asparagus, about 3 minutes for eggplant and zucchini, and about 1 minute for bok choy leaves.  Pat snow peas dry; cut on diagonal into thin strips.  (Vegetables can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat.  Add vegetables and toss until heated through, about 4 minutes.  Season vegetables with salt and pepper.

Bring sauce to simmer.  Spoon 1/3 cup in center of each of 6 plates.  Mound 1/6 of vegetables on each plate and serve.

This recipe yields 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  The chile-tamarind sauce is a refined, complex variation on classic satay sauce, which is traditionally thickened with peanuts.  This rendition owes its silky texture to mashed kabocha squash.  At Arun's, this is served both as an appetizer and as a main course.

* Note:  Tamarind is a legume with large brown seedpods.  The pulp is used in Indian, Thai, Caribbean, and Latin American cooking.  The pulp is sold in block form and is available at Indian markets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
** Note:  Guajillo chiles are maroon-colored, fairly hot dried chiles up to 6 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.  Available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sauce:  Place tamarind square in small bowl.  Cover with boiling water and let stand until pulp softens, breaking apart occasionally with fork, about 45 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer tamarind pulp with seeds to strainer set over medium bowl.  Press pulp through sieve, leaving seeds behind.  Measure 2 teaspoons pulp for sauce (discard remaining pulp).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook squash in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain squash.  Return to same saucepan and mash to smooth puree.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook guajillo chiles in medium saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain, cool, stem, and seed chiles.  Place chiles in blender.  Add 1/2 cup water, lemongrass, shallot, ginger, garlic, and lime peel.  Puree until chile paste is smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer paste to medium saucepan.  Whisk in coconut milk, fish sauce, brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons tamarind pulp.  Add kabocha squash puree and bring to simmer, whisking often.  Simmer until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors blend, whisking occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Vegetables:  Bring medium pot of water to boil; salt generously.  Add snow peas and cook just until crisp-tender, about 15 seconds.  Using large slotted spoon, transfer peas to colander.  Rinse with cold water and drain well.  Repeat cooking, rinsing, and draining with each remaining vegetable in separate batches in same pot of boiling salted water until vegetables are just crisp-tender, about 1 minute for asparagus, about 3 minutes for eggplant and zucchini, and about 1 minute for bok choy leaves.  Pat snow peas dry; cut on diagonal into thin strips.  (Vegetables can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATO-CHIPOTLE PUREE ===

  1                     onion -- chopped
  2              large  tomatoes -- coarsely chopped

     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  minced jalapeÒo chiles
                        === SHRIMP TEMPURA ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2               cups  rice flour
                        = (available at specialty and natural
                        foods stores)
  2               cups  club soda
  24                    uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        tail shells left intact
  4               cups  thinly-sliced romaine lettuce

For Tomato-Chipotle Puree:  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until very brown, about 6 minutes.  Add tomatoes, garlic, and chipotle chiles.  Cook 1 minute.  Transfer mixture to blender; puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer puree to bowl.  Cover and chill until cold.

For Avocado Puree:  Combine all ingredients in processor; puree until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer puree to bowl.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of puree; chill at least 20 minutes and up to 3 hours.

For Shrimp Tempura:  Add enough vegetable oil to heavy large pot to reach depth of 3 1/2 inches.  Heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.

Whisk rice flour and club soda in large bowl to blend.  Working in batches, dip shrimp into batter and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to paper towels.

Divide romaine among 8 stemmed cocktail glasses.  Simultaneously pour 1/4 cup tomato puree and 1/4 cup avocado puree over romaine in each glass, letting purees meet in center.  Hang 3 shrimp over rim of each glass.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Janet and Travis Kuhl of Cranford, New Jersey, writes: "We recently went to chef Ming Tsai's Blue Ginger restaurant in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  Our entire meal was top-notch, but the shrimp cocktail was our favorite."

Poured carefully side by side into a cocktail glass, tomato puree and avocado puree make a colorful dip for the lightly battered and quickly deep-fried shrimp.

  2                     eggs -- beaten to blend

For Steak Filling:  Mix first 6 ingredients in small bowl.  Rub spice mixture all over both sides of steak.  Chill overnight.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Place drained wood chips in aluminum foil pan; place pan directly atop coals on barbecue.  When chips begin to smoke, sprinkle steak with salt and pepper.  Grill steak about 6 minutes per side for rare.  Cool slightly.  Trim and discard any fat from steak, then finely chop steak.

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and bell pepper; sautÈ until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add chopped steak and tomato paste; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Stir in parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For Crust:  Blend flour, paprika, and salt in processor.  Add lard by tablespoonfuls to processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in until coarse meal forms.  Add 1/2 cup water; process until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball.  Divide dough in half; flatten each half into disk.  Wrap each disk in plastic; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

Oil 2 large baking sheets.  Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to generous 1/8-inch thickness.  Using 4-inch-diameter plate or bowl as guide, cut out rounds.  Place 1 rounded tablespoon steak filling in center of each dough round.  Top filling on each with scant 1 teaspoon goat cheese.  Brush dough edges with egg glaze.  Fold dough over filling, enclosing filling.  Using fork, seal crust edges.

Transfer empanadas to prepared sheets.  Repeat with second dough disk, remaining filling, and cheese.  Gather and reroll dough scraps and cut out additional rounds until all dough is used.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover empanadas and remaining egg glaze separately and chill.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Brush empanadas with remaining egg glaze.  Bake empanadas until crust is golden, about 28 minutes.  Transfer to plates.

This recipe yields about 18 empanadas.

Comments:  This is a terrific make-ahead appetizer.  The steak must be coated with the spice rub and chilled overnight before grilling, then the empanadas can be assembled completely one day before baking.

  2 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloins
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4           cup  low-salt chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  cold butter

For Celery Root Puree:  Bring celery root and milk to boil in heavy large saucepan over high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until celery root is very tender, about 20 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer celery root to processor.  Add 1/2 cup hot milk.  Puree until very smooth.  Blend in butter and lemon juice.  Season with salt and white pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Lentils:  SautÈ bacon in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until crisp, about 3 minutes.  Add carrots, shallots, and rosemary; sautÈ until shallots begin to soften, about 1 minute.  Add lentils and 3 cups water; bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until lentils are tender and liquid has nearly evaporated, about 35 minutes.  Stir in butter.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Pork:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Whisk first 4 ingredients in bowl.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Add pork; sautÈ until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes total.  Brush pork with honey mixture.  Transfer skillet to oven; roast pork 10 minutes.  Turn pork over and brush with honey mixture.  Roast until thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 145 degrees, about 10 minutes longer.  Transfer pork to work surface; tent with foil (temperature will increase 5 degrees).

Add broth and remaining honey mixture to same skillet.  Boil over high heat until sauce is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes.  Strain sauce into small bowl.  Return sauce to skillet.  Whisk in butter.  Season with salt and pepper.

Rewarm celery root puree and lentils.  Cut pork crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Place 1/2 cup celery root puree in center of each of 6 plates.   Using back of spoon, make indentation in puree. Spoon 1/2 cup lentils into indentation on each plate.  Arrange pork slices atop lentils and drizzle with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

* Note:  Dried ancho chiles and chipotle chiles canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Heat heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add ancho chile pieces; toast until aromatic and lighter in color around edges, pressing with potato masher or back of fork and turning pieces, about 2 minutes.

Add 1 tablespoon oil to reserved pot.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Add ancho chile puree; cook until puree thickens and darkens, stirring often, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Add tomato puree.  Simmer until thick, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in pumpkin and 3 cups broth.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer until mole thickens and reduces to 3 1/3 cups, about 30 minutes.  Whisk in cream and sugar.  Season to taste with salt.

Puree 2 tablespoons oil and 2 chipotle chiles in small processor or force through sieve to make thick glaze.  Transfer to bowl.  (Mole and glaze can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rewarm mole.  Spread chipotle glaze thinly over both sides of chicken breasts.  Sprinkle chicken generously with salt.  Grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to plates.  Spoon mole over each.  Crumble reserved ancho chile piece; sprinkle over chicken.  Garnish with cilantro sprigs and lime.

  4               cups  dashi
     1/2           cup  mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2             pounds  red snapper fillets -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/2"-wide strips
  1              pound  firm tofu (bean curd) -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes

Comments:  Dashi is Japanese fish broth made with bonito flakes and kombu.  Powdered dashi concentrate is available at Japanese markets.

Mirin is available at Japanese markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Garland chrysanthemum is a fragrant fresh green that can be found in the produce section of Japanese markets under the name shingiku and in Chinese markets under the name tung hao.

  2              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  2                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse sea salt
  1 1/2           cups  olive oil -- or more if needed
                        === CRUST ===
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        = (preferably European style)
  2              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  water - (about) -- room temperature
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- to blend
                        === SALAD TOPPING ===
  8               cups  assorted mixed greens - (loosely packed)
                        = (including arugula and frisÈe)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2             ounces  Parmesan cheese -- shaved with a
                        vegetable peeler - (abt 1/2 cup)
  6              large  fresh basil leaves

For Tomato Confit:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Oil large rimmed baking sheet.  Arrange tomatoes on baking sheet.  Scatter thyme sprigs and garlic cloves over.  Drizzle with 1/2 cup olive oil, then sprinkle with coarse sea salt.  Bake tomatoes 45 minutes.  Turn tomatoes over; continue to bake until tomatoes shrink slightly but are still plump and moist, about 1 hour longer.  Cool completely.  Peel off skins.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For Marinated Tomatoes:  Bring large pot of water to boil.  Add tomatoes; blanch 30 seconds.  Drain.  Cool tomatoes.  Peel, quarter, and seed tomatoes.  Cut away membranes.  Transfer tomatoes to glass jar or bowl.  Add thyme, garlic cloves, and salt.  Pour enough oil over tomatoes to cover.  Let stand at room temperature 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For Crust:  Blend flour and salt in processor.  Using on/off turns, cut in butter until coarse meal forms.  Add 2 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon water; process just until moist clumps form, adding more water if dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.  Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough on lightly floured parchment paper to 12-inch round.  Transfer parchment with crust to baking sheet.  Pierce crust all over with fork; brush with egg glaze.  Bake until crust is golden brown, about 27 minutes.  Cool crust completely on parchment on baking sheet.

For Salad Topping:  Toss greens with oil and sea salt in large bowl.  Place crust on platter.  Arrange greens atop crust, leaving 1-inch plain border.

Starting at outside edge and working toward center, alternate tomato confit and marinated tomatoes in slightly overlapping concentric circles atop greens.  Top with Parmesan shavings.  Garnish with basil leaves.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Serve this beautiful starter with Champagne or sparkling wine.

  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  4 1/8      teaspoons  Creole seasoning
  1                cup  diced peeled cored pineapple
  1                cup  diced peeled pitted mango
     1/2           cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  diced red onion
  6               cups  mixed baby greens
  4                     golden trout fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea) -- with skin

Whisk 4 tablespoons oil, lime juice, sugar, ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon Creole seasoning in small bowl to blend.  Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.  Combine pineapple, mango, bell pepper, and red onion in large bowl.  Add half of vinaigrette; toss to coat.  Toss greens in medium bowl with remaining vinaigrette.

Brush trout fillets with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with remaining 4 teaspoons Creole seasoning, about 1/2 teaspoon per side, then salt and pepper.  Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add trout fillets and cook until just opaque in center and browned, about 2 minutes per side.

Divide greens among 4 plates.  Place trout fillets and salsa alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chef Tory McPhail writes: "I was 19 years old and just out of culinary school when I first started at Commander's Palace.  Despite my training, nothing prepared me for the pressures of working in a fast-paced kitchen, or in a restaurant of such high quality.  I think my success came down to sheer effort and a lifelong passion for cooking.  Even as a kid I loved playing with cookie and pie dough.

"After a seven-year absence, which I spent working abroad and opening a new Commander's Palace restaurant in Las Vegas, I came back to New Orleans last year.  Since returning I've enjoyed cooking for my friends.  On the weekends we'll go fishing, and then I'll grill our catch and serve it along with a fresh salad.  That meal combines the two best things about living in the South ó lots of fishing and great fresh produce."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unsalted European-style butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Sift flour, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, cornstarch, and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually beat in granulated sugar and vanilla.  Stir in dry ingredients in 3 additions, mixing until just blended each time.  Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Roll each half into 6-inch-long log; wrap each log in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Position racks in top third and center of oven; preheat to 325 degrees.  Cut each log crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Arrange slices on 2 heavy large baking sheets, spacing 1/2 inch apart (cookies will spread very little).  Bake cookies 9 minutes.  Reverse baking sheets; bake just until cookies turn golden brown at edges, about 9 minutes longer.  Cool cookies on sheets 1 minute.  Using thin metal spatula, transfer cookies to racks; cool.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen cookies.

Comments:  European-style butter pushes the already incredible crumbly richness of classic shortbread to a whole new level.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1 1/4           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  2                     vanilla beans -- split lengthwise
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sour cream
                        === GUAVA TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  water -- plus
     1/2           cup  water
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  guava nectar or guava juice
                        ===
                        Mango-Lime Salad -- (see recipe)
                        Toasted sweetened flaked coconut

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray 8-inch-diameter springform pan with nonstick spray.

Mix graham cracker crumbs and sugar in processor.  Add melted butter; process until crumbs are evenly moistened.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom (not sides) of prepared pan.  Bake until crust is set and deep golden, about 12 minutes.  Cool crust while making filling.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth.  Add sugar, then scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; beat until smooth.  Add eggs 1 at a time, blending well after each addition.  Beat in sour cream.

Pour filling over crust.  Bake cake until puffed, golden on top, and set around edges, and center moves slightly when pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour (top may crack).  Cool 30 minutes.  Refrigerate uncovered overnight.  Using back of spoon, smooth any cracks on top of cake.

For Guava Topping:  Pour 2 tablespoons water into small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes.

Bring sugar and remaining 1/2 cup water to boil in medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 3 minutes.  Add guava nectar to sugar syrup; stir over medium-low heat just until mixture is hot.  Add gelatin mixture and stir just until gelatin dissolves.  Place in freezer until gelatin begins to thicken slightly but is still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Spoon guava topping over cheesecake, spreading to edges of cake.  Chill until topping sets, at least 8 hours or overnight.

Using small sharp knife, cut around sides of cake to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Cut cake into wedges and transfer to plates.  Spoon Mango-Lime Salad alongside.  Sprinkle with toasted coconut.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Start preparing this two days before you plan to serve it.  Toast the coconut in a 350 degree oven until light golden in spots, stirring frequently, about ten minutes.

                      Warm Lentil Soup With Pancetta

Recipe By     :Chef Geoffrey Zakarian
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- cut thin strips
                        = (Italian bacon cured in salt, available
                        at Italian markets, some specialty foods
                        stores, and some supermarkets)
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped celery - (abt 3 stalks)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped white onion - (abt 1 medium)
     3/4           cup  chopped carrot
  2             slices  thick-cut bacon -- chopped
  1               head  garlic -- most of outer skin
                        removed, cut in half crosswise
  2              small  bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1              pound  French green lentils -- rinsed, drained
  10              cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  8                     green onions -- quartered
                        crosswise, then cut lengthwise into thin
                        strips

SautÈ pancetta in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until crisp and brown.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain (do not clean pot).  Spoon 1 tablespoon drippings into medium skillet and reserve.

Add celery, onion, carrot, bacon, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme to remaining drippings in pot and sautÈ until vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes.  Add lentils and stir 1 minute.  Add 10 cups broth; bring to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until lentils are soft, about 1 hour.  Discard bay leaves and garlic.

Using slotted spoon, transfer 2 cups lentils to small bowl; cover and reserve.  Working in batches, puree remaining soup until almost smooth.  Return to pot.  Add cream and vinegar.  Thin with more broth to desired consistency.  Season with salt and pepper.

Reheat pancetta drippings in reserved skillet over medium-high heat.  Add green onions; sautÈ until wilted, about 1 minute.

Divide soup among bowls.  Spoon lentils in center of each bowl, dividing equally.  Garnish with pancetta and green onions and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Virginia Flesher of Charleston, West Virginia, writes: "Last spring I attended my oldest grandson's college graduation in New York.  The evening before the ceremony, the entire family dined at Town in the Chambers Hotel.  I can still remember chef Geoffrey Zakarian's superb lentil soup."

Recipe By     :Chef Gale Gand
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COMPOTE ===
  2               cups  apple juice
     3/4           cup  diced dried Calimyrna figs - (abt 5 oz)
     3/4           cup  diced dried pitted prunes - (abt 5 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel - (packed)
                        === CUSTARDS ===
  2 1/3           cups  whipping cream
     1/3           cup  half-and-half
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (abt 5") -- split lengthwise
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        ===
  9          teaspoons  raw sugar crystals

For Compote:  Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until figs and prunes are soft, about 10 minutes.  Cool compote slightly.  Transfer to small bowl.  (Compote can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Custards:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Arrange six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Combine cream, half-and-half, and pepper in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring cream mixture to simmer over medium heat.  Cover; set aside 10 minutes to steep.  Discard vanilla bean.  Whisk egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in warm cream mixture.

Divide custard among ramekins.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.  Bake custards until set in center, about 35 minutes.  Remove custards from water; refrigerate uncovered until cold, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Preheat broiler.  Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons raw sugar crystals over top of each custard.  Place custards on small baking sheet and broil until sugar melts and browns, rotating sheet for even browning, about 3 minutes.  Refrigerate custards uncovered until topping hardens, at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.

Serve custards with compote.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Raw sugar melts easily and makes a nice crunchy topping on the custards.
