Place 2 quarters of charred romaine on each dinner plate.  Drizzle with dressing, working back and fourth, strapping the lettuce with dressing.  Set salmon on top of the salad.  Garnish with chopped scallions and serve.

                   Buttered Beets And Peas With Onions

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2               cans  sliced beets - (15 oz) -- drained
  1                cup  frozen pearl onions -- defrosted
  2                     boxes frozen baby peas - (10 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste

In a medium skillet over moderate heat melt 2 tablespoons butter, add parsley and sliced beets.  Warm through, season with salt and serve.

In a second skillet, also over moderate heat, melt remaining butter, add onions and warm through.  Add peas and cook 5 minutes.  Season with salt and transfer to a serving dish.

If your stovetop is too crowded when you find your pocket-of-time to deal with the sides, feel free to use your microwave for either of these dishes, loosely covering beets or peas.  Microwave on high, but check them every couple of minutes -- you're just warming them through and melting the butter.

This recipe yields 6 servings of each.

Comments:  Two UK-favorite sides in under 10 minutes.

  1                     vine ripe tomato -- thinly sliced

Preheat grill pan, nonstick griddle, large nonstick skillet or table top electric grill to medium-high heat.

Add 2 tablespoons of oil and Canadian bacon.  Warm bacon and caramelize it at edges, 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Remove to a piece of foil.  Fold foil over loosely to keep warm.

Combine chicken, paprika, poultry seasoning, grill seasoning, shallot.  Score meat with the side of your hand to separate into 4 equal amounts.  Make 4 large patties, 3/4- to 1-inch thick.  Drizzle patties with oil and place on hot grill pan, griddle or in skillet.  Cook 5 minutes on each side, until chicken is cooked through.

Top patties with reserved cooked Canadian bacon and Swiss cheese.  Fold each slice of cheese in half to fit the burger.  Cover loosely with tin foil.  Turn off pan and let cheese melt, 2 minutes.

Combine mayonnaise, mustard, tarragon.  Slather bun tops or English tops with sauce.  Place Cordon Bleu burgers on bun bottoms and top with lettuce and tomato.  Put bun or muffin tops in place.  Serve with oven fries.

This recipe yields 4 (1/2-pound) chicken burgers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  soft caramel candies - (24 pieces) -- unwrapped
     1/2           cup  unsalted dry roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  white chocolate chip morsels
  1 1/4           cups  sweetened coconut flakes
                        Vegetable cooking spray -- as needed

Line a 8- by 8-inch square microwave-safe dish with plastic wrap allowing the wrap to come over the sides.  Spray the prepared dish with cooking spray.

Spray a medium-size, microwave-safe bowl with cooking spray.  To the prepared bowl, add the caramel candies, peanuts, white chocolate and 1/2 cup of the coconut.  Give it a stir to combine.  Set the microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds on high.  Place the bowl in the microwave and cook 1 minute.  Stop the microwave, stir the mixture, return to microwave to cook 30 seconds longer.  Remove the mixture and stir.

Scrape mixture into the prepared square pan.  Flatten it with a rubber spatula evenly.  Cover the top of the candy with remaining coconut, using the rubber spatula to press it in slightly.  If the mixture is too firm on top for the coconut to stick, place the mixture back in the microwave for 10 seconds, then resume pressing the coconut into the candy.

Allow the candies to cool completely.  Remove the entire block, using the plastic wrap to help you pull it out.  Using a sharp knife, cut candy into small, 1-inch squares.

This recipe yields 64 pieces.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  fennel bulb -- trimmed of tough
                        tops, reserving 2 tbspns of the fronds
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  yellow skinned onion - (to large) -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  white wine
  1              large  russet potato - (or 2 medium) -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                cup  chicken stock

Add extra-virgin olive oil, fennel and onion to the pan and saute them, stirring frequently, 5 minutes.  Season with salt.  Add wine and reduce by half.

Add potatoes to the pan in thin layers, completely covering the fennel and onions, working all the way to the edges of the pan.  Pour the stock evenly over the pan.

Season fish with salt and pepper.  Arrange the fish on the potatoes.  Bring the liquids to a bubble.  Cover the pan and transfer to oven.

Bake fish 15 minutes, until opaque, then uncover and bake for 2 or 3 minutes more.

Transfer fish and vegetables to shallow bowls or dinner plates and garnish with parsley and fronds.  Spoon juices down over the food.  Serve with crusty bread for dipping.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  packaged duck breast - (to 2)
                        = (ask at your meat counter - if the
                        market does not carry duck breast year
                        round, it can usually be ordered for you)
  1                     bag mixed baby greens
  1               head  frissee greens
                        = (look for very lightly colored frissee)
  3                     scallions -- thinly sliced on an
                        angle
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
  2        tablespoons  orange marmalade
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Score fat and skin on duck breasts.  Place duck breast skin-side down in a large cold skillet with a heat safe handle.  Put skillet on stove and turn burner on to moderate heat.  Cook breasts 5 to 8 minutes, turning once the skin crisps and most of the fat is rendered.  Place the skillet in the oven and cook another 9 to 12 minutes.  Meat should be pink at center.

Arrange greens on individual plates or 1 large platter.  Arrange frissee and scallions on bed of baby greens.

Combine shallots, vinegar and marmalade.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Whisk in extra-virgin olive oil.

Slice duck breast and serve 6 to 8 ounces per person, arranging the sliced duck on the salad.  Grilled or sauteed chicken or pork is delicious with this dressing as well.  Pour dressing evenly over duck and salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  12                    thin slices white bread -- crusts trimmed
                        = (Pepperidge Farm recommended)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  onions -- very thinly sliced
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
  2          teaspoons  ground thyme

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2               cans  Italian tuna in olive oil - (6 oz ea) -- drained
     1/2          pint  small cherry or grape tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  gemelli pasta -- cooked to al dente
                        = (short braids of pasta or other
                        short-cut pastas can be substituted,
                        such as penne rigate)
     1/3           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  20                    fresh basil leaves -- shredded

Heat a large, deep skillet over medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil and garlic to the pan.  When garlic speaks by sizzling in oil, add tuna and mash into oil with the back of a wooden spoon.  Let the tuna sit in the oil 5 to 10 minutes to infuse the fish flavor into the extra-virgin olive oil and to give the tuna time to break down -- it will almost melt into the extra-virgin olive oil.

Raise the flame a bit and add the coarsely chopped tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Heat the tomatoes through, 2 minutes, then add hot, drained pasta that has been cooked to al dente in salted water.  Add parsley to the tuna and pasta and toss to combine well and evenly coat pasta.  Adjust seasonings.  Top pasta with shredded basil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    eggs -- beaten
  4             ounces  garlic and herb cheese
                        = (such as Boursin or Alouette or, cream
                        cheese, cut or crumbled into small pieces)
  3        tablespoons  chopped chives - (abt 12 blades)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A few drops hot sauce
  2        tablespoons  butter or extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     plum or Roma tomatoes -- sliced lengthwise
                        === OPTIONAL ADDITIONS ===
                        Smoked salmon
                        Sliced ham or salami -- chopped
                        === TOAST ===
  8             slices  white, wheat, soft-sliced Italian or
                        whole grain bread
  2              large  garlic cloves -- cracked
  4        tablespoons  softened salted butter

Whisk eggs with cheese and chives and season with salt and pepper and a few drops hot sauce.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add butter or extra-virgin olive oil to the pan.  Heat butter or oil, then add eggs.  Add the optional addition, if desired, at this point.  Scramble to desired consistency and serve with a sliced plum tomato per person, seasoned with salt and pepper, alongside the eggs.  Pass garlic toast at table: rub hot toast with cracked garlic, then butter as usual.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  John and I keep a small bottle of truffle oil in the cupboard.  We drizzle it on these eggs for an extra-special finish.  Try it some time.  The eggs are pretty tasty as-is, too.  The recipe easily adjusts to feed 1 or more.  Enjoy.

  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- finely chopped
  1                can  flat avchovy fillets - (6 to 7 fillets) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried thyme)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  clam juice or chicken stock
  1                can  fancy whole baby clams - (15 oz)

Lay out 8 slices of rye bread.  Dot bread with teaspoonfuls of red pepper relish.  Top with even amounts of smoked turkey, sauerkraut and thinly sliced cheese.  Top cheese with remaining slices of bread.  Brush griddle or skillet with oil and butter mixture.  Grill and toast sandwiches 2 or 3 minutes on each side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  McIntosh apples
  2                     wedges lemon
  6        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1                cup  dark brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated or ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  oatmeal

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Trim a thin slice off of the bottom of each apple.  Cut the tops off apples and trim way skin of tops of apples, trim should be 1/2-inch wide.  Hollow out the apples with a small paring knife, carving out a cavity for the filling.  Rub the tops and cavities with wedges of lemon to retard browning.

Combine butter, sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, nuts, flour and oatmeal in a bowl -- mixture should be crumbly -- and then pack into apples.  Place apples in a shallow baking dish and add 1/4-inch of water to the dish.  Bake apples 17 to 20 minutes, until filling bubbles and apples are tender but not soft.  Remove from oven.  Serve warm or room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  softened butter
  1            package  frozen pierogis, potato filled dumplings -- any brand or variety
  1 1/2         pounds  kielbasa -- cut large slices on
                        an angle
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              large  red onion -- quartered, sliced
  1 1/2         pounds  kale -- trimmed, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1              pound  sauerkraut -- drained
  1           teaspoon  ground mustard
                        = (or 2 tbspns prepared spicy brown
                        mustard)
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
                        = (or 2 tspns dried dill leaves)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        A handful of parsley leaves -- chopped
  1                cup  sour cream

Cover the bottom of a skillet with softened butter.  Arrange pierogis in the pan in a single layer.  Add 1 cup water to the pan.  Cover pan and place over medium-high heat.  Cook covered 8 minutes, remove lid and cook out any liquid in the pot.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Brown kielbasa and remove from pan.  Cover kielbasa with foil to keep warm.

Drain fat and add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon butter.  Raise heat to high.  Add onion to the pan and saute for a few minutes to soften.  Add chopped kale in batches as it wilts into the pan.  When kale is wilted, add sauerkraut.  Season stir-fry with mustard, paprika, salt and pepper.  Return kielbasa to pan.  Toss to combine and transfer to a serving platter.

Let the pierogis "stick" and brown in the butter as the liquid evaporates.  Remove crisp pierogis from heat to a plate.

Stir together the chopped herbs and sour cream and season with salt and pepper.  Serve with pierogis.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recommended beverage:  Icy cold beer in frosted glass or beer mug.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  portobello mushroom caps
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling, plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Steak seasoning blend -- to taste
                        = (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning, or
                        use coarse salt and black pepper)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  Italian bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  shredded or grated Parmesan

Preheat a grill pan over medium-high to high heat.

Scrape the gills off the underside of portobello mushroom caps with a spoon.  Brush caps gently with a damp cloth to clean them.  Drizzle caps with oil to keep them from sticking to the grill pan and season the caps with steak seasoning or salt and black pepper.

Grill mushrooms 3 or 4 minutes on each side under a loose tin foil tent until just tender.  Remove from heat and cool 5 minutes.

Slice grilled caps into 1/2-inch strips.  Turn strips in egg, then coat in mixture of parsley, bread crumbs and cheese.  Cook 'fries' over medium-high heat in enough extra-virgin olive oil to coat a nonstick skillet in a thin layer, about 1/4 cup.  'Fries' will brown in 2 or 3 minutes on each side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2           cup  chili sauce
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/2           cup  vegetable juice
                        = (V8 recommended)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- wedged

If you bought raw shrimp, steam shrimp until pink, about 5 minutes, then cold shock under running water.  Place in freezer until ready to serve.

Mix celery, horseradish, lemon juice, hot sauce, chili sauce, ketchup and vegetable juice together and season with salt and pepper.

Pour sauce into 4 martini glasses and surround rim with chilled shrimp.  Serve lemon wedges alongside glasses on cocktail forks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I just loved the Rat Pack -- supper clubbing in Vegas.  Too cool.  (So is this shrimp cocktail...)

                        Portobello Mushroom 'Fries' -- (see recipe)
                        === SALAD ===
  1                     bag mixed baby greens - (abt 6 cups)
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced on

  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1         tablespoon  spicy brown mustard - (rounded)

Heat a deep skillet or medium pot over moderate heat.  Add oil, crushed pepper, garlic and finely chopped onion.  Saute 5 to 7 minutes, until onion bits are soft.  Add beef stock, crushed tomatoes, and herbs.  Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.

Toss hot, drained pasta with a few ladles of the sauce and grated cheese.  Turn meatballs in remaining sauce.  Place pasta on dinner plates and top with meatballs and sauce and extra grated cheese.  Serve with bread or garlic bread (and some good chianti!)

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns dried thyme)
     1/2         small  red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  chicken or vegetable stock
     1/2           cup  half-and-half or heavy cream
  1                can  artichoke hearts in water - (15 oz) -- drained, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2                     boxes chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- defrosted, and
                        squeezed dry in kitchen towel
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Italian 4 cheese blend
                        = (provolone, Parmesan, mozzarella and
                        Asiago)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     round loaf crusty bread -- top removed and
                        cubed, bottom hollowed out to use as
                        serving bowl
  1                     loaf multigrain or whole wheat baguette -- sliced at
                        bakery/bread counter in market

To a medium saucepot preheated over moderate heat, add about 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream.  Add butter to oil.  When butter melts, add garlic and onions to the pot.  Sprinkle in thyme leaves.  Saute 2 minutes, add chopped red pepper.  Saute mixture a minute more.  Sprinkle in flour, stir to coat vegetables.  Cook flour 1 minute.  Whisk in wine and reduce by half.  Whisk in stock and thicken sauce 1 minute.  Stir in half-and-half or cream.  When sauce returns to a bubble, add artichokes, spinach and cheeses.  Keep stirring until cheeses melt and sauce is well combined.  Add salt and pepper and adjust seasonings, to your taste.

Pour dip into hollow bread bowl on serving platter and surround with sliced multi or whole grain bread for dipping.  Reserve extra dip to warm and refill as necessary.  Cut up bread bowl when baguette slices are gone -- the bowl is the best part as it absorbs juices from the dip.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BACON ===
  1             pounds  applewood smoked bacon
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar
                        === TOAST ===
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  half-and-half
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2            pinches  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground or freshly grated nutmeg
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  3               cups  corn flakes -- lightly crushed
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- lightly crushed
  4        tablespoons  butter
  12            slices  challah bread 1 1/2" thick
                        = (or soft "Italian" style bread)
                        Medium or dark amber maple syrup -- to pass at table
                        Mint sprigs and edible flowers -- suggested plate
                        garnish
                        === FANCY FRUIT TOPPING ===
  1              large  navel orange -- peeled, chopped
  12             large  strawberries -- sliced
     1/2          pint  blueberries
     1/2          pint  raspberries
     1/2          pint  blackberries
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange liqueur
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Arrange bacon on slotted broiler pan.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and place in oven to bake until crisp, 20 to 22 minutes.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.

In a shallow dish, beat together with a wire whisk: eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon.  In a second shallow dish combine flakes and nuts.  Add 2 tablespoons butter to warm skillet.  Place a cookie sheet lined with foil (for easy clean-up) near the stove.

Coat 4 to 6 slices of bread in egg, depending on the size of your skillet, then coat bread in cornflakes and nuts.  Cook slices 2 minutes on each side and transfer toast to cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining slices and transfer toast to oven.  Bake 10 minutes, with already cooking bacon.

While bacon and toast are in oven, combine fruit, sugar and liqueur in a serving bowl and reserve.

Remove toast and bacon from oven.  Warm syrup in a small pitcher in microwave 15 seconds on high.  Serve toast and bacon on plates with optional garnish of mint and edible flowers.

Pass syrup and topping at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.
