                            Apple Cake 'Tatin'

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature,
                        plus extra for greasing the dish
  1 1/4                 Granny Smith apples -- peeled, and
                        sliced into 12 pieces
  1 3/4           cups  granulated sugar -- divided
  2                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Generously butter a 9-inch glass pie dish and arrange the apples in the dish, cut-side down.

Combine 1 cup of the granulated sugar and 1/3 cup water in a small saucepan and cook over high heat until it turns a warm amber color, about 360 degrees on a candy thermometer.  Swirl the pan but don't stir.  Pour evenly over the apple slices.

Meanwhile, cream the 6 tablespoons of butter and the remaining 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy.  Lower the speed and beat in the eggs 1 at a time.  Add the sour cream, zest, and vanilla and mix until combined.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt and, with the mixer on low speed, add it to the butter mixture.  Mix only until combined.

Pour the cake batter evenly over the apple slices and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean.  Cool for 15 minutes, then invert the cake onto a flat plate.  If an apple slice sticks, ease it out and replace it in the design on top of the cake.  Serve warm or at room temperature, dusted with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Asian Grilled Salmon

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     side fresh salmon - (abt 3 lbs) -- boned but skin on
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  good soy sauce
  6        tablespoons  good olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic

Light charcoal briquettes in a grill and brush the grilling rack with oil to keep the salmon from sticking.

While the grill is heating, lay the salmon skin-side down on a cutting board and cut it crosswise into 4 equal pieces.  Whisk together the mustard, soy sauce, olive oil, and garlic in a small bowl.  Drizzle half of the marinade onto the salmon and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.

Place the salmon skin-side down on the hot grill; discard the marinade the fish was sitting in.  Grill for 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.  Turn carefully with a wide spatula and grill for another 4 to 5 minutes.  The salmon will be slightly raw in the center, but don't worry; it will keep cooking as it sits.

Transfer the fish to a flat plate, skin-side down, and spoon the reserved marinade on top.  Allow the fish to rest for 10 minutes.  Remove the skin and serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.

Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.  Add the Cognac, stand back, and ignite with a match to burn off the alcohol.  Put the meat and bacon back into the pot with the juices.  Add the bottle of wine plus enough beef broth to almost cover the meat.  Add the tomato paste and thyme.  Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and place it in the oven for about 1 1/4 hours or until the meat and vegetables are very tender when pierced with a fork.

Combine 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour with a fork and stir into the stew.  Add the frozen onions.  Saute the mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of butter for 10 minutes until lightly browned and then add to the stew.  Bring the stew to a boil on top of the stove, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Season to taste.

To serve, toast the bread in the toaster or oven.  Rub each slice on 1 side with a cut clove of garlic.  For each serving, spoon the stew over a slice of bread and sprinkle with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  beef brisket - (to 7)
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic - (4 cloves)
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano leaves
  1              pound  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" chunks
  8                     celery stalks -- cut 2" chunks
  6                     yellow onions -- peeled, sliced
  6                     fresh or dried bay leaves
  1                can  tomato juice - (46 oz)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the brisket in a heavy roasting pan.  In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano.  Rub the mixture on the brisket.  Pile the carrots, celery, onions, and bay leaves on the brisket and pour in enough tomato juice to come about 3/4 of the way up the meat and vegetables.  Cover the top of the pan with 2 sheets of parchment paper, then with aluminum foil.  (The tomato juice will react unpleasantly with the aluminum foil if they touch.)

Bake for 3 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender.  Remove the meat from the pan and keep it warm.  Place the pan on 2 burners and boil the vegetables and sauce over medium heat for another 30 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened.

To serve, slice the meat across the grain.  Serve with the vegetables.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  3 1/4           cups  semisweet chocolate chips - (20 oz)
  3                     extra-large eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant coffee granules
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                cup  chopped walnuts - (4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream - (to 3)

Grease and flour a 9-inch tart pan with removable sides.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Melt the butter in a bowl set over simmering water.  Add 2 cups of the chocolate chips, remove from the heat, and stir until the chocolate melts.  Set aside to cool completely.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs, sugar, coffee, and vanilla on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooled chocolate.  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, 1 cup of the chocolate chips, and the walnuts.  Fold the flour mixture into the batter until just combined.  Pour into the pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the center is puffed (the top may crack).  The inside will still be very soft.  Cool to room temperature before removing the sides of the tart pan.

Melt the remaining 1/4 cup of chocolate chips with the heavy cream and drizzle on the tart.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
  6             ounces  Italian pancetta or bacon -- cut 1/4" dice
  1 1/2         pounds  Brussels sprouts - (2 containers) -- trimmed, and
                        cut in halves
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  golden raisins
  1 3/4           cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        = (or canned broth)

Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan and add the pancetta.  Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the fat is rendered and the pancetta is golden brown and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the pancetta to a plate lined with a paper towel.

Add the Brussels sprouts, salt, and pepper to the fat in the pan and saute over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned.  Add the raisins and chicken stock.  Lower the heat and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sprouts are tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes.  If the skillet becomes too dry, add a little chicken stock or water.  Return the pancetta to the pan, heat through, season to taste, and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  3             pounds  boiling potatoes -- peeled
                        = (such as Yukon gold)
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     3/4           cup  buttermilk - (to 1)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil.  Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into 1 1/2-inch cubes and add them to the boiling water.  Bring the water to a boil again, lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes fall apart easily when pierced with a fork.

Meanwhile, heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan, making sure it doesn't boil.  Set aside until the potatoes are done.

As soon as the potatoes are tender, drain them in a colander.  Place a food mill fitted with a small disc/blade over a heatproof bowl.  Process the potatoes through the food mill, turning the handle back and forth.  As soon as the potatoes are mashed, stir in the hot milk-and-butter mixture with a whisk or rubber spatula.  Add enough buttermilk to make the potatoes creamy.  Add 2 teaspoons of salt and the pepper, to taste, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream - (to 1 1/2)
     1/2                vanilla bean
                        = (or 1/2 tspn pure vanilla extract)

Mix the water and sugar in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Cover and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a medium brown, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.  Watch it carefully at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly.

Stand back to avoid splattering, and gradually add the cream and the seeds scraped from the vanilla bean (or vanilla extract).  Simmer until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth and thick, about 2 minutes.  Serve warm, or add another 1/4 cup of heavy cream and serve room temperature.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     extra-large eggs
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half or milk
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  good honey
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              large  loaf challah or brioche bread
                        Unsalted butter -- as needed
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        === TO SERVE ===
                        Pure maple syrup
                        Good raspberry preserves -- (optional)
                        Sifted confectioners' sugar -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

In a large shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, orange zest, vanilla, honey, and salt.  Slice the challah in 3/4-inch thick slices.  Soak as many slices in the egg mixture as possible for 5 minutes, turning once.

Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a very large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the soaked bread and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.  Place the cooked French toast on a sheet pan and keep it warm in the oven.  Fry the remaining soaked bread slices, adding butter and oil as needed, until it's all cooked.  Serve hot with maple syrup, raspberry preserves, and/or confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 8 slices.

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4                     extra-large eggs
     1/2           cup  grated Gruyere -- plus
                        extra for sprinkling
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a saucepan, heat the milk, butter, salt, pepper, and nutmeg over medium heat, until scalded.  Add the flour all at once and beat it vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together.  Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for 2 minutes.  The flour will begin to coat the bottom of the pan.  Dump the hot mixture into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Immediately add the eggs, Gruyere, and Parmesan and pulse until the eggs are incorporated and the dough is smooth and thick.

Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip.  Pipe in mounds 1 1/4 inches wide and 3/4-inch high onto the baking sheets.  With a wet finger, lightly press down the swirl at the top of each puff.  (You can also use 2 spoons to scoop out the mixture and shape the puffs with damp fingers.)  Brush the top of each puff lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with a pinch of Gruyere.  Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown outside but still soft inside.

This recipe yields 40 puffs.

                        more for chicken
  2               cans  whole peeled plum tomatoes in puree - -- (28 oz ea), undraine
     1/4           cup  minced fresh basil leaves
  4                     split bone-in skin-on chicken breasts
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TOPPING SUGGESTIONS ===

                   Chicken With Forty Cloves Of Garlic

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              whole  garlic heads - (abt 40 cloves)
  2                     chickens - (3 1/2 lbs ea) -- cut into eighths
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
  3        tablespoons  Cognac -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream

Separate the cloves of garlic and drop them into a pot of boiling water for 60 seconds.  Drain the garlic and peel.  Set aside.

Dry the chicken with paper towels.  Season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides.  Heat the butter and oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  In batches, saute the chicken in the fat, skin-side down first, until nicely browned, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side.  Turn with tongs or a spatula; you don't want to pierce the skin with a fork.  If the fat is burning, turn the heat down to medium.

When a batch is done, transfer it to a plate and continue to saute all the chicken in batches.  Remove the last chicken to the plate and add all of the garlic to the pot.  Lower the heat and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, turning often, until evenly browned.  Add 2 tablespoons of the Cognac and the wine, return to a boil, and scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Return the chicken to the pot with the juices and sprinkle with the thyme leaves.  Cover and simmer over the lowest heat for about 30 minutes, until all the chicken is done.

Remove the chicken to a platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.  In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the sauce and the flour and then whisk it back into the sauce in the pot.  Raise the heat, add the remaining tablespoon of Cognac and the cream, and boil for 3 minutes.  Add salt and pepper, to taste; it should be very flavorful because chicken tends to be bland.  Pour the sauce and the garlic over the chicken and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  good semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2             ounces  good bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  orange liqueur
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)
     1/4           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  8                     extra-large eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  cold heavy cream
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  2               cups  cold heavy cream - (1 pint)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1               dash  pure vanilla extract
                        Drained Mandarin oranges -- for decoration

Combine the 2 chocolates, orange liqueur, 1/4 cup water, and the vanilla in a heat-proof bowl.  Set it over a pan of simmering water just until the chocolate melts.  Cool completely to room temperature.  Whisk in the orange zest and butter until combined.

Place the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Beat on high speed for 4 minutes, or until very thick and pale yellow.  With the mixer on low speed, add the chocolate mixture.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Place 1 cup of egg whites (save or discard the rest), the salt, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  Beat on high speed until firm but not dry.  Whisk 1/4 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture; then fold the rest in carefully with a rubber spatula.

Without cleaning the bowl or whisk, whip the heavy cream and the remaining tablespoon of sugar until firm.  Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.  Pour the mousse into individual dishes or an 8-cup serving bowl.  Chill and decorate with whipped cream and oranges.  Serve with extra whipped cream on the side.

Whipped Cream:  Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whip until the cream forms stiff peaks.  Don't overbeat, or you'll end up with butter!

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  good bittersweet chocolate -- such as Lindt
     1/2         pound  good semisweet chocolate -- such as Ghiradelli
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  prepared coffee
     1/2      teaspoon  good vanilla extract
                        Confectioners' sugar
                        Cocoa powder

Chop the chocolates finely with a sharp knife.  Place them in a heat-proof mixing bowl.

Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it just boils.  Turn off the heat and allow the cream to sit for 20 seconds.  Pour the cream through a fine-meshed sieve into the bowl with chocolate.  With a wire whisk, slowly stir the cream and chocolates together until the chocolate is completely melted.  Whisk in the Grand Marnier, if using, coffee, and vanilla.  Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.

With 2 teaspoons, spoon round balls of the chocolate mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes, until firm.  Roll each dollop of chocolate in your hands to roughly make a round ball.  Roll in confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder, or both.  These will keep refrigerated for weeks, but serve at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  2                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  good unsweetened cocoa
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/2         pounds  good white chocolate -- coarsely chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cream the butter and 2 sugars until light and fluffy in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Add the vanilla, then the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix well.  Add the cocoa and mix again.  Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt and add to the chocolate with the mixer on low speed until just combined.  Fold in the chopped white chocolate.

Drop the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, using a 1 3/4-inch ice cream scoop or a rounded tablespoon.  Dampen your hands and flatten the dough slightly.  Bake for exactly 15 minutes (the cookies will seem underdone).  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly on the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken livers
  1                cup  rendered chicken fat
  2               cups  medium-diced yellow onion - -- (2 onions)
     1/3           cup  Madeira wine
  4                     hard-cooked extra-large eggs -- peeled, chunked
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper

Drain the livers and saute them in 2 batches in 2 tablespoons of the chicken fat over medium-high heat, turning once, for about 5 minutes, or until just barely pink inside.  Don't overcook the livers or they will be dry.  Transfer them to a large bowl.

In the same pan, saute the onions in 3 tablespoons of the chicken fat over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, or until browned.  Add the Madeira and deglaze the pan, scraping the sides, for about 15 seconds.  Pour into the bowl with the livers.

Add the eggs, parsley, thyme, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and the remaining chicken fat to the bowl.  Toss quickly to combine.  Transfer half the mixture to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Pulse 6 to 8 times, until coarsely chopped.  Repeat with the remaining mixture.  Season, to taste, and chill.  Serve on crackers or matzo.

This recipe yields 5 cups.

Drain the livers and saute them in 2 batches in 2 tablespoons of the chicken fat over medium-high heat, turning once, for about 5 minutes, or until just barely pink inside.  Don&apos;t overcook the livers or they will be dry.  Transfer them to a large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the same pan, saute the onions in 3 tablespoons of the chicken fat over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, or until browned.  Add the Madeira and deglaze the pan, scraping the sides, for about 15 seconds.  Pour into the bowl with the livers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the eggs, parsley, thyme, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and the remaining chicken fat to the bowl.  Toss quickly to combine.  Transfer half the mixture to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Pulse 6 to 8 times, until coarsely chopped.  Repeat with the remaining mixture.  Season, to taste, and chill.  Serve on crackers or matzo.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     extra-large whole eggs
  8                     extra-large egg yolks
  5               cups  half-and-half
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  6                     croissants, preferably stale -- sliced horizontally
  1                cup  raisins

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla.  Set the custard mixture aside.  Slice the croissants in half horizontally.

In a 10- by 15- by 2 1/2-inch oval baking dish, distribute the bottoms of the sliced croissants, then add the raisins, then the tops of the croissants (brown side up), being sure the raisins are between the layers of croissants or they will burn while baking.  Pour the custard over the croissants and allow to soak for 10 minutes, pressing down gently.

Place the pan in a larger one filled with 1-inch of hot water.  Cover the larger pan with aluminum foil, tenting the foil so it doesn't touch the pudding.  Cut a few holes in the foil to allow steam to escape.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Uncover and bake for 40 to 45 more minutes or until the pudding puffs up and the custard is set.  Remove from the oven and cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2     tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  freshly squeezed lemon juice - (2 lemons)
     1/4           cup  good olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3              heads  endive
  3                     ripe Haas avocados -- peeled, seeded

Whisk together the mustard, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper to make a vinaigrette.  Remove a 1/2-inch from the stem end of each endive, discard the core, and cut the rest across into 1-inch chunks.  Cut the avocados into large dice or wedges.  Toss the avocados and endive with the vinaigrette.  Season, to taste, and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Haas avocados are the brown ones from California.  The green ones don't have nearly as much flavor.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  half-and-half
  6                     extra-large egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt

  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  4             ounces  chocolate-covered espresso beans -- chopped

Heat the half-and-half until it forms bubbles around the edge of the pan and steam starts to rise.

Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the egg yolks, sugar, and salt until mixed.  Slowly add the hot half-and-half until combined.  Wipe out the pan and pour the mixture back into the clean pan.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 5 to 10 minutes, until it's thickened and the cream coats the back of the spoon.  Pour the cream through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl.  Add the ground espresso beans, Kahl˙a, and vanilla and refrigerate until completely chilled.

Pour the espresso cream into an ice-cream freezer and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions.  Mix in the chopped espresso beans, spoon into a container, and allow to freeze for a few hours.  Soften slightly before serving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Be sure you have finely ground espresso beans, not instant espresso.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4         pound  blue d'Auvergne
                        = (or other creamy blue cheese)
     2/3           cup  sour cream
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FILLET OF BEEF ===
  1 1/2         pounds  whole fillet of beef -- trimmed and tied
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        === ASSEMBLE ===
  1                     loaf health or 7-grain bread
                        Dressing -- (listed above)
                        Thinly-sliced rare Fillet Of Beef -- (listed above)
  1              bunch  arugula
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature

For the dressing, mash the blue cheese with a fork and blend with the sour cream, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper.

For the fillet of beef, preheat oven 500 degrees.

Melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter.  Place beef on a baking sheet and pat the outside dry with a paper towel.  Using a pastry brush coat the beef with the melted butter.  Sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper.  Roast for 25 minutes at 500 degrees for medium rare.

Remove the beef from the oven, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before slicing.

To make the sandwiches, cut the bread into 8 slices, each slice 1/4-inch thick.  Spread 4 of the slices thickly with the dressing.  Top with slices of beef and arrugula and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread the rest of the slices of bread very lightly with butter and place, butter-side down, on top of the beef.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the dressing, mash the blue cheese with a fork and blend with the sour cream, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper.

For the fillet of beef, preheat oven 500 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter.  Place beef on a baking sheet and pat the outside dry with a paper towel.  Using a pastry brush coat the beef with the melted butter.  Sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper.  Roast for 25 minutes at 500 degrees for medium rare.

<DirT>
Remove the beef from the oven, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before slicing.

To make the sandwiches, cut the bread into 8 slices, each slice 1/4-inch thick.  Spread 4 of the slices thickly with the dressing.  Top with slices of beef and arrugula and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spread the rest of the slices of bread very lightly with butter and place, butter-side down, on top of the beef.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  3               cups  sugar
  6                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  sour cream -- room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  3               cups  flour
     1/3           cup  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
                        === ICING ===
  1              pound  unsalted butter - (4 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese -- room temperature
  1              pound  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2                     half-pints blueberries
  3                     half-pints raspberries

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour an 18- by 13- by 1 1/2-inch sheet pan.

Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high speed, until light and fluffy.  On medium speed, add the eggs, 2 at a time, then add the sour cream and vanilla.  Scrape down the sides and stir until smooth.

Sift together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.  With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture until just combined.  Pour into the prepared pan.  Smooth the top with a spatula.  Bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool to room temperature.

For the icing, combine the butter, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mixing just until smooth.

Spread three-fourths of the icing on the top of the cooled sheet cake.  Outline the flag on the top of the cake with a toothpick.  Fill the upper left corner with blueberries.  Place 2 rows of raspberries across the top of the cake like a red stripe.  Put the remaining icing in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe two rows of white stripes below the raspberries.  Alternate rows of raspberries and icing until the flag is completed.  Pipe stars on top of the blueberries.

I serve this cake right in the pan.  If you want to turn it out onto a board before frosting, use parchment paper when you grease and flour the pan.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small white boiling potatoes
  1              pound  small red boiling potatoes
  2        tablespoons  good dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  10       tablespoons  good olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced scallions (white and green parts)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
  2        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  julienned fresh basil leaves

Drop the white and red potatoes into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until they are just cooked through.  Drain in a colander and place a towel over the potatoes to allow them to steam for 10 more minutes.  As soon as you can handle them, cut in 1/2 (quarters if the potatoes are larger) and place in a medium bowl.  Toss gently with the wine and chicken stock.  Allow the liquids to soak into the warm potatoes before proceeding.

Combine the vinegar, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and slowly whisk in the olive oil to make an emulsion.  Add the vinaigrette to the potatoes.  Add the scallions, dill, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs - (10 crackers)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  6                     extra-large egg yolks -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  grated lime zest
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice - (4 to 5 lime
                        === DECORATION ===
  1                cup  cold heavy cream - (1/2 pint)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                     Thin lime wedges

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the crust, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a bowl.  Press into a 9-inch pyrex pie pan, making sure the sides and the bottom are an even thickness.  Bake for 10 minutes until firm and golden.  Allow to cool completely.

For the filling, beat the egg yolks and sugar on high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment for 5 minutes, until thick.  With the mixer on medium speed, add the condensed milk, lime zest, and lime juice.  Pour into the baked pie shell and freeze.

For the decoration, beat the heavy cream on high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form.  Add the sugar and vanilla and beat until firm.  Spoon or pipe decoratively onto the pie and decorate with lime.  Freeze for several hours or overnight.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell..."

Comments:  If you have concerns about raw eggs, combine the yolks with 1/2 cup of the lime juice used in the recipe in a double boiler.  Whisk constantly over medium heat until the mixture reaches 140 degrees.  Use in place of the raw egg yolks, remembering to add the remaining 1/4 cup of lime juice to the filling mixture along with the condensed milk and zest.

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baby spinach leaves
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic - -- (6 cloves)
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Lemon -- as needed
                        Sea or kosher salt -- (optional)

Rinse the spinach well in cold water to make sure it's very clean.  Spin it dry in a salad spinner, leaving just a little water clinging to the leaves.

In a very large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and saute the garlic over medium heat for about 1 minute, but not until it's browned.  Add all the spinach, the salt, and pepper to the pot, toss it with the garlic and oil, cover the pot, and cook it for 2 minutes.  Uncover the pot, turn the heat on high, and cook the spinach for another minute, stirring with a wooden spoon, until all the spinach is wilted.  Using a slotted spoon, lift the spinach to a serving bowl and top with the butter, a squeeze of lemon, and a sprinkling of sea or kosher salt.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting the board
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  13       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- divided
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)
     3/4           cup  chopped shallots - (3 to 4 shallots)
  10 1/2        ounces  garlic-and-herb soft goat cheese
                        = (Montrachet recommended}
  1                cup  heavy cream
  3                     extra-large eggs
     1/4                chopped basil leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the crust, put the flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Cut 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) of the butter into large dice, add to the bowl, and pulse until the butter is the size of peas.  With the machine running, add the ice water all at once and process until the dough becomes crumbly.  Don't overprocess.  Dump the dough out on a floured board, gather it loosely into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Roll the dough on a well-floured board and fit it into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable sides, rolling the pin over the top to cut off the excess dough.  Butter 1 side of a square of aluminum foil and fit it, butter-side down, into the tart pan.  Fill the foil with rice or beans.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Remove the beans and foil from the tart shell, prick the bottom all over with a fork, and bake for another 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of butter in a small pan and saute the shallots over low heat for 5 minutes, or until tender.  Place the goat cheese in the bowl of the food processor and process until crumbly.  Add the cream, eggs, basil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the pepper and process until blended.

Scatter the cooked shallots over the bottom of the tart shell.  Pour the goat cheese mixture over the shallots to fill the shell (if the shell has shrunk, there may be leftover filling).  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the tart is firm when shaken and the top is lightly browned.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes and serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh garlic
  1                     extra-large egg yolk -- room temperature
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  good olive oil
                        Salad greens or mesclun mix -- for 6 to 8 people

In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, garlic, egg yolk, salt, and pepper.  While whisking, slowly add the olive oil until the vinaigrette is emulsified.  Toss the greens with enough dressing to moisten and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell..."

Comments:  If you're worried about raw egg, just omit it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  large shrimp - (16/20 ct) -- peeled, deveined
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  yellow onion -- small diced
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  minced fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  good olive oil
  1                     lemon -- juiced

Combine all the ingredients and allow them to marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

Skewer the shrimp.  I use 3 or 4 shrimp on a 12-inch skewer for dinner.  Heat a grill with coals and brush the grill with oil to prevent the shrimp from sticking.  Grill the shrimp for only 1 1/2 minutes on each side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  I leave the tails on when I'm peeling the shrimp.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     one-inch-thick fresh tuna steaks - -- (abt 4 lbs)
                        Good olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
     3/4         pound  French string beans (haricots verts) -- stems removed,
                        and blanched
  1             recipe  French Potato Salad -- (see recipe)
  2             pounds  ripe tomatoes - (6 small) -- cut into wedges
  8                     hard-cooked eggs -- peeled, and
                        cut in halves
     1/2         pound  good black olives -- pitted
  1              bunch  watercress or arrugula
  1                can  anchovies -- (optional)
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  3        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  10       tablespoons  good olive oil

To grill the tuna, get a charcoal or stove-top cast iron grill very hot.  Brush the fish with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill each side for only 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  The center should be raw, like sushi, or the tuna will be tough and dry.  Arrange the tuna, haricots verts, potato salad, tomatoes, eggs, olives, watercress, and anchovies, if used, on a large flat platter.

For the vinaigrette, combine the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper.  Slowly whisk in the olive oil to make an emulsion.  Drizzle some over the fish and vegetables and serve the rest in a pitcher on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     ripe Haas avocados
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - -- (1 lemon)
  8             dashes  hot pepper sauce
     1/2           cup  small-diced red onion - -- (1 small onion)
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  tomato -- seeded, diced small

Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh out of their shells into a large bowl.  (I use my hands.)  Immediately add the lemon juice, hot pepper sauce, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper and toss well.  Using a sharp knife, slice through the avocados in the bowl until they are finely diced.  Add the tomatoes.  Mix well and taste for salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh out of their shells into a large bowl.  (I use my hands.)  Immediately add the lemon juice, hot pepper sauce, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper and toss well.  Using a sharp knife, slice through the avocados in the bowl until they are finely diced.  Add the tomatoes.  Mix well and taste for salt and pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16              cups  one-inch bread cubes
                        = (white or whole wheat - 2 baguettes)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2               cups  medium-diced yellow onion - (2 large)
  2               cups  medium-diced celery - (3 large stalks)
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- unpeeled, cored,
                        and large diced
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary leaves
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  sliced blanched almonds -- toasted, (optional)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Put the bread cubes on a 13- by 18- by 1-inch baking sheet and bake them in the oven for 7 minutes.

In a large saute pan, melt the butter and add the onion, celery, apples, parsley, rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Saute for 10 minutes, until the mixture is soft.

Combine the bread cubes and cooked vegetables in a large bowl and add the chicken stock, and almonds, if desired.

Place the stuffing into the main cavity of the turkey and into the neck of the bird.  I cook a 12-pound turkey for 2 1/2 hours at 350 degrees in a preheated oven.  Make sure the stuffing in the cavity is secured by wrapping the legs tightly with string.

                        === SPREAD ===
  8             ounces  low-fat cream cheese -- room temperature
  10 1/2        ounces  mild goat cheese -- room temperature
                        = (such as Montrachet)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2 1/2         pounds  small white or Yukon gold potatoes -- scrubbed, but
                        not peeled
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped mixed fresh green herbs
                        = (such as parsley, chives, and dill)

Melt the butter in a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot.  Add the whole potatoes, salt, and pepper and toss well.  Cover the pot tightly and cook over low heat for 20 to 30 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender when tested with a small knife.  From time to time, shake the pot without removing the lid to prevent the bottom potatoes from burning.  Turn off the heat and allow the potatoes to steam for another 5 minutes.  Don't overcook!  Toss with the herbs, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onion - -- (2 onions)
     1/4           cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Defatted turkey drippings -- plus
                        chicken stock to make 2 cups -- heated
  1         tablespoon  Cognac or brandy
  1         tablespoon  white wine -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream -- (optional)

In a large (10- to 12-inch) saute pan, cook the butter and onions over medium-low heat for 12 to 15 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned.  Don't rush this step; it makes all the difference when the onions are well-cooked.

Sprinkle the flour into the pan, whisk in, then add the salt and pepper.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the hot chicken stock mixture and Cognac, and cook uncovered for 4 to 5 minutes until thickened.  Add the wine and cream, if desired.  Season, to taste, and serve.

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              pints  Mango Sorbet -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2          pints  good raspberry sorbet -- softened
  1               pint  good strawberry ice cream -- softened

Freeze an 8-inch bowl.  When it's cold, place the mango sorbet in the bowl and press it against the sides of the bowl.  If you have a 6 1/2-inch bowl the same shape as the 8-inch bowl (such as from a set of nesting bowls), cover it with plastic wrap and press it into the sorbet to make the layer even.  Freeze the sorbet for 30 minutes or until firm.  Remove the 6 1/2-inch bowl.

Spread an even layer of softened raspberry sorbet on top of the mango sorbet (a 4 1/2-inch nesting bowl wrapped in plastic wrap helps with this) and freeze for another 30 minutes or until firm.  Remove the 4 1/2 inch bowl.

Finally, spoon in enough softened strawberry ice cream to fill the bowl.  Freeze until hard.

To unmold, dip the bowl up to the rim in warm water.  Run a knife around the edge to loosen the bombe and unmold upside down onto a flat plate.  You may need to run a flexible metal spatula along the edge of the bombe to release it.  Freeze until ready to serve.  Serve in wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  good olive oil
  3               cups  chopped yellow onions - -- (3 onions)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
     1/3           cup  canned chicken stock or broth
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2 1/2         pounds  ground chuck (81% lean)
     1/2           cup  plain dry bread crumbs
                        = (Progresso recommended)
  2                     extra-large eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  ketchup
                        = (Heinz recommended)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan.  Add the onions, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are translucent but not brown.  Off the heat, add the Worcestershire sauce, chicken stock, and tomato paste.  Allow to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, onion mixture, bread crumbs, and eggs, and mix lightly with a fork.  Don't mash or the meatloaf will be dense.  Divide the mixture into 6 (10- to 11-ounce) portions and shape each portion into a small loaf on a sheet pan.  Spread about a tablespoon of ketchup on the top of each portion.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the internal temperature is 155 to 160 degrees and the meat loaves are cooked through.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  kielbasa
  3               cups  chopped yellow onions - (2 large onions)
  2               cups  chopped leeks -- well cleaned
                        = (2 leeks, white parts only)
     1/4           cup  good olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  small potatoes (red or white)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              dozen  littleneck clams -- scrubbed
  2              dozen  steamer clams -- scrubbed
  2             pounds  mussels -- cleaned, debearded
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- in the shell
  3                     lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
  2               cups  good dry white wine

Slice the kielbasa diagonally into 1-inch thick slices.  Set aside.  Saute the onions and leeks in the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed 16- to 20-quart stockpot over medium heat for 15 minutes, until the onions start to brown.

Layer the ingredients on top of the onions in the stockpot in this order: first the potatoes, salt, and pepper; then the kielbasa, little neck clams, steamer clams, mussels, shrimp, and lobsters.  Pour in the white wine.  Cover the pot tightly and cook over medium-high heat until steam just begins to escape from the lid, about 15 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium and cook another 15 minutes.  The clambake should be done.

Test to be sure the potatoes are tender, the lobsters are cooked, and the clams and mussels are open.  Remove the lobsters to a wooden board, cut them up, and crack the claws.  With large slotted spoons, remove the seafood, potatoes, and sausages to a large bowl and top with the lobsters.  Season the broth in the pot to taste, and ladle over the seafood, being very careful to avoid any sand in the bottom.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh 1/2"-thick lamb sausage
  2                     sheets commercial puff pastry -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard -- plus
                        extra for serving
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water or milk -- for egg wash

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Bake the sausage on a baking sheet for 20 minutes.  Turn the sausage and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more, until it's fully cooked.  Cool to room temperature.

Unfold the puff pastry on a lightly floured board.  Cut each piece in 1/2 lengthwise and brush the top sides with mustard.  Divide the sausage into 4 equal pieces.  Starting at the long end of the pastry, place 1 piece of the sausage on top of the mustard and roll it up tightly, overlapping the end by 1/2-inch and sealing the pastry by brushing the edge with water.  Cut off the excess pastry.  Roll the other 3 pieces of sausage in puff pastry.

Place the 4 rolls, seam-side down, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Brush with the egg wash.  Lightly score each roll diagonally to make 7 equal pieces.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until browned.  Slice and serve hot with mustard.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sifted superfine sugar -- divided
  1 1/3           cups  sifted cake flour (not self-rising)
  1 1/2           cups  egg whites - (10 to 12 eggs) -- room temperature
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cream of tartar
     3/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon zest - (2 lemons)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Combine 1/2 cup of sugar with the flour and sift together 4 times.  Set aside.

Place the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the eggs make medium-firm peaks, about 1 minute.  With the mixer on medium speed, add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of sugar by sprinkling it over the beaten egg whites.  Whisk for a few minutes until thick and shiny.  Whisk in the vanilla and lemon zest and continue to whisk until very thick, about 1 more minute.  Sift about 1/4 of the flour mixture over the egg whites and fold it into the batter with a rubber spatula.  Continue adding the flour by fourths by sifting and folding until it's all incorporated.

Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, smooth the top, and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, until it springs back to the touch.  Remove the cake from the oven and invert the pan on a cooling rack until cool.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar -- divided
  4                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  grated lemon zest - (lightly packed)
                        = (6 to 8 large lemons - use only fresh
                        lemon juice and zest)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE ===
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2- by 4 1/4- by 2 1/2-inch) loaf pans.

Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, the key to great cakes is beating the butter and sugar until the mixture's until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  With the mixer on medium speed add the eggs, (break the eggs into a dish before adding to the batter to avoid a bad egg or shells in the batter) 1 at a time, and the lemon zest.

Sift together the flour, to make sure there are no lumps, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  Separately, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately, beginning and ending with the flour.  Divide evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.

Cook 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves.  When the cakes are done, cool for 10 minutes, invert them onto a rack set over a tray and spoon the lemon syrup over the cakes.  Allow the cakes to cool completely.

For the glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and the lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth.  Pour over the tops of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.  To freeze these cakes, prepare them except the glaze.  Wrap them well in plastic wrap and freeze.  When you're ready to use, defrost and glaze.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bone-in pork loin - (abt 5 lbs, 10 bones) -- Frenched and tied
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard -- divided
  4          teaspoons  whole-grain mustard -- divided
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel seed
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  good white wine
  3               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        = (or use canned broth)
     1/4           cup  green peppercorns in brine -- drained

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Allow the pork to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Place the pork, fat-side up, in a roasting pan just large enough to hold it comfortably.  In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 2 teaspoons of each mustard, the fennel seed, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  Rub the mixture on top of the pork and roast for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees.  Remove from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and cover tightly with aluminum foil for 20 minutes.

For the sauce, remove all but 1/4 cup of fat from the roasting pan.  If there isn't 1/4 cup, add enough butter to the pan to make 1/4 cup total.  Over medium heat, whisk the flour into the fat in the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Add the wine and scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Add the chicken stock, the remaining 2 teaspoons of each mustard, the green peppercorns, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened.

Remove the strings from the roast pork, slice between the bones, and serve warm with the hot sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3 1/2           cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  good raspberry preserves
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter and sugar until they are just combined.  Add the vanilla.  In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt, then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture.  Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together.  Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes.

Roll the dough 1/4-inch thick and cut 2 3/4-inch rounds with a plain or fluted cutter.  With 1/2 of the rounds, cut a hole from the middle of each round with a heart or spade shaped cutter.  Place all the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet and chill for 15 minutes.

Bake the cookies for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges begin to brown.  Allow to cool to room temperature.  Spread raspberry preserves on the flat side of each solid cookie.  Dust the top of the cut-out cookies with confectioners' sugar and press the flat sides together, with the raspberry preserves in the middle and the confectioners' sugar on the top.

Serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with confectioners' sugar, and creme fraiche.

For the filling, heat the half-and-half, pumpkin, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water until hot, about 5 minutes.  Whisk the egg yolks in another bowl, stir some of the hot pumpkin into the egg yolks to heat them, then pour the egg-pumpkin mixture back into the double boiler and stir well.  Heat the mixture over the simmering water for another 4 to 5 minutes, until it begins to thicken, stirring constantly.  You don't want the eggs to scramble.  Remove from the heat.  Dissolve the gelatin in 1/4 cup cold water.  Add the dissolved gelatin, banana, and orange zest to the pumpkin mixture and mix well.  Set aside to cool.

Whip the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until soft peaks form.  Add the sugar and continue to whisk until you have firm peaks.  Carefully fold the whipped cream into the pumpkin mixture and pour it into the cooled tart shell.  Chill for 2 hours or overnight.

For the decoration, whip the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form.  Add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whisk until you have firm peaks.  Pipe or spoon the whipped cream decoratively on the tart and sprinkle, if desired, with orange zest.  Serve chilled.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
                        extra for sprinkling
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     3/4         pound  cold unsalted butter -- diced
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  cold heavy cream
     3/4           cup  raisins
  1                     extra-large egg -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  milk or water -- for egg wash

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Combine 4 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, the baking powder, and salt in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.  Blend in the cold butter at the lowest speed and mix until the butter is in pea-sized pieces.  Combine the eggs and heavy cream and quickly add to the flour/butter mixture.  Combine until just blended.  Combine the raisins and 1 tablespoon flour and then add to the dough and mix quickly.  The dough may be a bit sticky.

Dump the dough out onto a floured surface and be sure it is well combined.  Flour your hands and a rolling pin and roll the dough out to 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick.  You will see lumps of butter in the dough.  Cut into squares with a 4-inch cutter and then cut in half diagonally to make triangles.  Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.

Brush the scones with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the outsides are crisp and the insides are done.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lime -- halved
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice - -- (5 limes)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - -- (1 lemon)
  1                cup  Triple Sec
  3               cups  ice
  1                cup  white tequila

If you like margaritas served in a glass with salt, rub the outside rims of six glasses with a cut lime and dip each glass lightly into a plate of kosher salt.

Combine the lime juice, lemon juice, Triple Sec, and ice in a blender and puree until completely blended.  Add the tequila and puree for 2 seconds more.  Serve over ice.

If you prefer frozen margaritas, halve each of the ingredients, double the ice, and blend in two batches.  Serve with a cut lime.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1                     boneless pork loin - (abt 3 lbs) -- trimmed and tied
  3              small  fennel bulbs -- tops removed
  8                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        thickly sliced diagonally
  10             small  potatoes (red or white-skinned) -- cut in quarters
  2                     yellow onions -- thickly sliced
  4        tablespoons  good olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

With a mortar and pestle, or in a food processor fitted with a steel blade, grind together the garlic, 1 tablespoon salt, and thyme leaves.  Add the mustard.  Spread the mixture over the loin of pork and allow it to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut the fennel bulbs in thick wedges, cutting through the core.  Toss the fennel, carrots, potatoes, and onions in a bowl with the olive oil, melted butter, salt, and pepper to taste.  Place the vegetables in a large roasting pan and cook for 30 minutes.  Add the pork loin to the pan and continue to cook for another 30 to 50 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the pork reads exactly 138 degrees.

Remove the meat from the pan and return the vegetables to the oven to keep cooking.  Cover the meat with aluminum foil and allow it to rest for 15 minutes.  Remove the strings from the meat and slice it thickly.  Arrange the meat and vegetables on a platter.  Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Serve warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  9        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     3/4           cup  raisins
  1                cup  walnuts -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  apricot preserves -- pureed in a
                        food processor
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  milk -- for egg wash

Cream the cheese and butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light.  Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar, the salt, and vanilla.  With the mixer on low speed, add the flour and mix until just combined.  Dump the dough out onto a well-floured board and roll it into a ball.  Cut the ball in quarters, wrap each piece in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

To make the filling, combine 6 tablespoons of granulated sugar, the brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, the raisins, and walnuts.

On a well-floured board, roll each ball of dough into a 9-inch circle.  Spread the dough with 2 tablespoons apricot preserves and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the filling.  Press the filling lightly into the dough.  Cut the circle into 12 equal wedgesócutting the whole circle in quarters, then each quarter into thirds.  Starting with the wide edge, roll up each wedge.  Place the cookies, points tucked under, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brush each cookie with the egg wash.  Combine 3 tablespoons granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon and sprinkle on the cookies.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned.  Remove to a wire rack and let cool.

This recipe yields 4 dozen cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
     3/4           cup  white basmati rice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  5               cups  half-and-half -- divided
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3                     extra-large egg -- beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract

Combine the raisins and rum in a small bowl and set aside.

Combine the rice and salt with 1 1/2 cups water in a medium heavy-bottomed stainless steel saucepan.  Bring it to a boil, stir once, and simmer, covered, on the lowest heat for 8 to 9 minutes, until most of the water is absorbed.  (If your stove is very hot, pull the pan half off the burner.)

Stir in 4 cups of half-and-half and sugar and bring to a boil.  Cook uncovered on a low boil for 25 minutes, until the rice is very soft.  Stir often, particularly towards the end.  Slowly stir in the beaten egg and continue to cook for 1 minute.  Off the heat, add the remaining cup of half-and-half, the vanilla, and the raisins with any remaining rum.  Stir well.

Pour into a bowl, and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming.  Chill.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil -- plus
                        extra for searing
  1 1/2           cups  diced yellow onion - (2 onions)
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2                     ripe mangos -- peeled, seeded,
                        and small diced
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  2          teaspoons  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh jalapeÒo pepper - (to 2) -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh mint leaves
  2                     tuna steaks

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
                        extra for sprinkling
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3 1/2           cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and 1 cup of sugar until they are just combined.  Add the vanilla.  In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt; then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture.  Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together.  Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and roll shape into a flat disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes.

Roll the dough 1/2-inch thick and cut with a 3-inch heart-shaped cutter.  Place the hearts on an ungreased sheet pan and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges begin to brown.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The edges of the shortbread are ever so slightly sharper if you chill the cookies before baking them.  I cut out the cookies days ahead and bake them the day I serve them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  gold tequila
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice - -- (5 to 6 limes)
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice - -- (2 oranges)

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     extra-large egg yolks -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  good dark rum -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  brewed espresso -- divided
  16            ounces  mascarpone cheese - (to 17)
  30                    Italian ladyfingers -- or savoiardi
                        Bittersweet chocolate -- shaved or grated
                        Confectioners' sugar -- (optional)

Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed for about 5 minutes, or until very thick and light yellow.  Lower the speed to medium and add 1/4 cup rum, 1/4 cup espresso, and the mascarpone.  Whisk until smooth.

Combine the remaining 1/4 cup rum and 1 1/4 cups espresso in a shallow bowl.  Dip 1 side of each ladyfinger in the espresso/rum mixture and line the bottom of a 9- by 12- by 2-inch dish.  Pour half the espresso cream mixture evenly on top.  Dip 1 side of the remaining ladyfingers in the espresso/rum mixture and place them in a second layer in the dish.  Pour the rest of the espresso cream over the top.  Smooth the top and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate overnight.

Before serving, sprinkle the top with shaved chocolate and dust lightly with confectioners' sugar, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  To make espresso for this recipe in your electric drip coffee maker, use enough water for 4 cups of coffee plus 1/3 cup of ground espresso.

You can find savoiardi and mascarpone in an Italian specialty store.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell..."

Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed for about 5 minutes, or until very thick and light yellow.  Lower the speed to medium and add 1/4 cup rum, 1/4 cup espresso, and the mascarpone.  Whisk until smooth.

<DirT>
Combine the remaining 1/4 cup rum and 1 1/4 cups espresso in a shallow bowl.  Dip 1 side of each ladyfinger in the espresso/rum mixture and line the bottom of a 9- by 12- by 2-inch dish.  Pour half the espresso cream mixture evenly on top.  Dip 1 side of the remaining ladyfingers in the espresso/rum mixture and place them in a second layer in the dish.  Pour the rest of the espresso cream over the top.  Smooth the top and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate overnight.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: &quot;There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell...&quot;

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  plain yogurt - (1 pint)
                        = (whole milk or low fat)
  1                     hothouse cucumber -- unpeeled, seeded
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - (1 lemon)
  1         tablespoon  good olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh dill
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the yogurt in a cheesecloth or paper towel-lined sieve and set it over a bowl.  Grate the cucumber and toss it with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt; place it in another sieve, and set it over another bowl.  Place both bowls in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours so the yogurt and cucumber can drain.

Transfer the thickened yogurt to a large bowl.  Squeeze as much liquid from the cucumber as you can and add the cucumber to the yogurt.  Mix in the sour cream, vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, dill, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper.  You can serve it immediately, but I prefer to allow the tzatziki to sit in the refrigerator for a few hours for the flavors to blend.  Serve chilled or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups.

Combine the vanilla beans and vodka in a jar tall enough to hold the vanilla beans.  Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for at least a month until the vodka becomes vanilla extract and the beans are soft enough to cut the end and squeeze the seeds out.  Add more vodka or beans, as needed.  The extract can sit at room temperature indefinitely.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  sushi rice - (2 3/4 cups)
  3               cups  water
     1/4           cup  mirin -- plus
                        additional for moistening nori
  5                     sheets nori - (1 pkg)
  4          teaspoons  wasabi powder -- mixed with
  2          teaspoons  water
     1/2           cup  small-diced red onion
  1                     carrot -- julienned
  1                     red bell pepper -- julienned
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- julienned
  1                     scallion (green part only) -- julienned
  1                     hothouse cucumber -- seeded, julienned
  1                jar  pickled ginger - (10 oz)
                        === SUSHI DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2      teaspoon  wasabi powder
     1/4      teaspoon  water
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  minced pickled ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced scallion (green part only)
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  good soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  dark sesame oil

Place the rice in a strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water is fairly clear, about 5 minutes.  Shake the water out and allow the rice to dry in the strainer for 15 minutes.

Put the rice in a pot with exactly 3 cups of water and cook covered over high heat until it starts to foam, about 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Turn off the heat and sprinkle with 1/4 cup mirin.  Replace the lid and allow the rice to steam for 15 minutes.  Place in a bowl and cool to room temperature.

To prepare the sushi, place a bamboo sushi roller flat on a table with the bamboo reeds horizontal to you.  Sprinkle lightly with water.  Place 1 nori sheet on top, smooth-side down, and moisten lightly with mirin.  With damp hands, press 1 1/4 cups rice flat on top of the nori, leaving 1 1/2-inch edges on the top and bottom, but pressing all the way to the sides.  Make sure the rice is pressed even and smooth.

Spread 1/4 teaspoon of wasabi paste in a horizontal stripe near the lower edge of the rice.  Over the wasabi, lightly sprinkle the red onions in a horizontal stripe.  Place strips of carrots in a horizontal stripe, on top of the wasabi and onions, and follow by piling the red and yellow peppers, scallions, and cucumbers on top, making a tight, straight bundle of vegetables.  Place 1 layer of pickled ginger slices on top.

To roll the sushi, pick up the near edge of the bamboo roller and hold it with the nori, then pull them up and over the vegetable bundle until the nori reaches the rice on the other side.  Press the roller to make a round bundle, then roll the bundle to the far edge of the nori and press again to make a round bundle.  (The nori should totally enclose the rice and vegetables in a round tube, but the ends will have rice and vegetables sticking out.)  Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.  Keep the rolls under a damp towel and refrigerate until ready to serve.  To serve, slice off the ends with a very sharp knife and slice each roll into 8 equal pieces.

Meanwhile, for the sushi dipping sauce, combine the wasabi powder and water to make a paste.  Mix in the red pepper flakes, ginger, scallions, vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil.  Serve the sushi at room temperature with the dipping sauce.
