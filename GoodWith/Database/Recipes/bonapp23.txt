                     Apple Cake With Caramel Topping

Recipe By     :Wendy Popp, Richmond, VA
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pound  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/3" cubes
  2               cups  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  1                cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  4          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  pecans - (abt 3 1/2 oz) -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  whole milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray 12-cup Bundt pan with nonstick spray.

Sift flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt into medium bowl.  Transfer 3 tablespoons flour mixture to Bundt pan and tilt to coat.  Set pan aside.

Place apples and 2 tablespoons flour mixture in another medium bowl; toss to coat apples.  Combine 1 cup brown sugar, vegetable oil, 1 cup sugar, eggs, and 3 teaspoons vanilla in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat until mixture is thick, about 4 minutes.  Gradually beat in remaining flour mixture.  Fold apple mixture and pecans into batter; transfer to prepared Bundt pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Transfer cake in pan to rack.  Let stand while making caramel.

Melt butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat.  Whisk in remaining 1 cup brown sugar, then milk.  Continue to whisk until topping is smooth and blended and comes to boil, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla.

Spoon 1/4 cup hot caramel topping over warm cake in pan.  Let stand until topping is absorbed into cake, about 15 minutes.  Turn cake out onto platter.  Pour remaining warm topping over cake.  Let stand until cool, at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Wendy Popp of Richmond, Virginia, writes: "My job as a physical therapist and my hobby, horseback riding, keep me pretty busy.  But my sons ó Sammy, two, and Weston, four ó keep me moving the most, which has changed my cooking style.  I used to be much more experimental, but now I need low-maintenance, tried-and-true recipes that will please the boys (including my husband, Jim) and impress dinner guests."

This moist Bundt cake is a slight variation on a local award-winning recipe.  After Wendy started making it, the dessert quickly became a family favorite.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fully-cooked bone-in smoked ham - (18 lbs) -- room temperature
  48                    whole cloves -- more or less
  4               cups  water
  1                cup  orange marmalade
     1/4           cup  prepared cream-style horseradish
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2               cups  fresh orange juice

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Place ham on rack set in large roasting pan.  Using sharp knife, score ham in diamond pattern.  Press 1 clove into center of each diamond.  Pour 4 cups water into roasting pan.  Roast ham 1 hour 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, blend marmalade, horseradish, and sugar in medium bowl.

Remove ham from oven.  Transfer ham to baking sheet.  Discard pan juices.  Return ham to roasting pan.  Add orange juice to roasting pan.  Brush top of ham with 1/3 of marmalade glaze.  Bake ham 10 minutes.  Baste with orange juice in pan, then brush with half of remaining glaze.  Bake ham 10 minutes.  Baste with orange juice in pan and brush with remaining glaze.  Roast ham until heated through, basting every 5 minutes, about 20 minutes longer.  Let ham rest 15 minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Serve ham hot, warm, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 20 servings.

Comments:  Although labeled fully cooked, the ham will still need a gentle baking for maximum tenderness and flavor.  Be sure the Cranberry Mustard and the Whole Wheat Date Rolls (see recipes) are close at hand and that the ham is sliced thin for those who would like to make small sandwiches.

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Place ham on rack set in large roasting pan.  Using sharp knife, score ham in diamond pattern.  Press 1 clove into center of each diamond.  Pour 4 cups water into roasting pan.  Roast ham 1 hour 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, blend marmalade, horseradish, and sugar in medium bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove ham from oven.  Transfer ham to baking sheet.  Discard pan juices.  Return ham to roasting pan.  Add orange juice to roasting pan.  Brush top of ham with 1/3 of marmalade glaze.  Bake ham 10 minutes.  Baste with orange juice in pan, then brush with half of remaining glaze.  Bake ham 10 minutes.  Baste with orange juice in pan and brush with remaining glaze.  Roast ham until heated through, basting every 5 minutes, about 20 minutes longer.  Let ham rest 15 minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Serve ham hot, warm, or at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 20 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Although labeled fully cooked, the ham will still need a gentle baking for maximum tenderness and flavor.  Be sure the Cranberry Mustard and the Whole Wheat Date Rolls (see recipes) are close at hand and that the ham is sliced thin for those who would like to make small sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE AND RIBS ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1             bottle  pale ale - (12 oz)
     1/4           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  5                     fresh thyme sprigs
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  16                    beef short ribs or 8 whole beef ribs
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  red wine vinegar
  2               cups  ketchup
     1/2           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  bourbon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Leaves from 5 fresh thyme sprigs
                        Charcoal chimney
  45                    charcoal briquettes

For Marinade And Ribs:  Combine all ingredients except ribs in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Cool marinade completely.  Place ribs in large heavy-duty resealable plastic bag; add marinade.  Seal bag; turn to coat ribs.  Refrigerate overnight, turning bag occasionally.

For Sauce:  Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until golden brown, about 6 minutes.  Add vinegar and boil until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add ketchup, molasses, and 1/4 cup water, then bourbon; stir to blend.  Bring sauce to simmer.  Stir in salt and white pepper.  Simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors.  Stir in thyme leaves.  (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Place handful of torn newspaper in bottom of charcoal chimney.  Top with 30 charcoal briquettes.  Remove top grill rack from barbecue.  Place chimney on bottom rack.  Light newspaper; let charcoal burn until ash is gray, about 30 minutes.

Open bottom barbecue vent.  Turn out hot charcoal onto 1 side of bottom rack.  Using metal spatula, move charcoal to cover approximately 1/3 of rack at 1 side.  Fill foil loaf pan halfway with water; place opposite charcoal on bottom rack.

Return top rack to barbecue.  Arrange ribs on top rack above water in loaf pan.  Cover barbecue with lid, positioning top vent directly over ribs.  Insert stem of candy thermometer through top vent, with gauge outside and tip near ribs (thermometer should not touch meat or barbecue rack); leave thermometer in place during cooking.  Use top and bottom vents to maintain temperature between 250 and 300 degrees, opening vents wider to increase heat and closing to decrease heat.  Leave other vents closed.  Check temperature every 10 minutes.

Cook ribs until meat is very tender when pierced with knife, turning ribs occasionally and basting often with sauce the last 10 minutes of cooking, about 3 hours total.  Open barbecue only when necessary to turn or baste meat and close quickly to minimize loss of heat and smoke.

After first 30 minutes of cooking, use technique described earlier to light additional 15 charcoal briquettes in charcoal chimney set atop nonflammable surface.  If cooking temperature drops below 250 degrees, use oven mitts to lift off top rack with ribs and place on heatproof surface.  Using tongs, add half of hot gray charcoal from chimney to bottom rack.  Replace top rack on barbecue, placing ribs above water in loaf pan.  Cover with lid.

Transfer ribs to plates; brush with more sauce and serve, passing any remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Beef rib meat becomes tender and succulent with slow cooking over low, indirect heat.  Marinate the ribs overnight and allow for three hours of cooking time on the grill.

                        seeded, cut into 1/2" cubes
  2               cups  shredded mozzarella cheese - (packed) -- abt 8 oz
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro -- plus
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

Place pizza crust on large baking sheet.  Spread 4 tablespoons barbecue sauce over crust.  Top with chicken mixture.  Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons sauce.  Bake pizza until heated through and cheese melts, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Bonnie Wilkens Metully of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes: "As much as my husband and I love to go out to eat, it's just more fun, intimate, and cozy to cook and entertain at home.  I've taught a lot of our friends just how easy it is to prepare restaurant-quality dishes themselves.  Who taught me?  My older sister, who's a professional chef.  She showed me the importance of getting everything prepped beforehand and seeking out the freshest ingredients."

This terrific dish also works well as an appetizer if it's cut into bite-size pieces.

Comments:  Bonnie Wilkens Metully of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes: &quot;As much as my husband and I love to go out to eat, it&apos;s just more fun, intimate, and cozy to cook and entertain at home.  I&apos;ve taught a lot of our friends just how easy it is to prepare restaurant-quality dishes themselves.  Who taught me?  My older sister, who&apos;s a professional chef.  She showed me the importance of getting everything prepped beforehand and seeking out the freshest ingredients.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
This terrific dish also works well as an appetizer if it&apos;s cut into bite-size pieces.

                         Barbecued Cowboy Steaks

Recipe By     :Robb Walsh
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried ground thyme
  1           teaspoon  finely-ground coffee beans
  4                     bone-in beef rib steaks, abt 1 1/4"
                        to 1 1/2"-thk, each weighing 12 to 16 oz
  1                     bag instant-light mesquite chunks - (2.2 l
  1                cup  mesquite or hickory wood smoke chips -- soaked in cold
                        water for at least 30 minutes

Mix first 6 ingredients in small bowl.  Sprinkle spice rub over both sides of steaks, pressing to adhere.  Let steaks stand at room temperature 1 hour.

Spread entire bag of instant-light mesquite chunks over 2/3 of bottom rack and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill steaks over mesquite until brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove steaks from grill.

Let mesquite chunks burn until ash is gray.  Drain wood chips; scatter over mesquite.  Return steaks to cooler part of grill (not over mesquite).  Cover barbecue with lid; grill steaks to desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium-rare.  Let steaks rest 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Those with Texas-size appetites will require an entire steak; for most others ó even the heartiest of meat lovers ó half of one of these rib steaks is probably plenty.

                      Beef Stroganoff With Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Shullie Neumark, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     top sirloin steak - (1 1/2 lbs) -- halved lengthwise,
                        cut crosswise into 1/4"-thk slices
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz) -- drained
     1/2           cup  beef broth
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper - (large)
                        Egg noodles -- freshly cooked
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Sprinkle meat with thyme and salt and pepper.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large deep skillet over high heat.  Add 1/3 of meat and stir just until meat is no longer pink, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer meat to medium bowl.  Repeat with remaining meat in 2 batches.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet.  Add onion and sautÈ over medium-high heat until brown, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer onion to bowl with meat.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet, then mushrooms and garlic.  Cover and cook until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Uncover and cook until liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes.  Sprinkle mushrooms with 2 tablespoons flour; stir 1 minute.

Return meat and onions with accumulated juices to skillet.  Add tomatoes, broth, and cayenne; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer uncovered until meat is tender, about 5 minutes.

Serve beef-mushroom mixture over egg noodles.  Sprinkle with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Shullie Neumark of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, writes: "I like cooking but I'm a little bit impatient, which is why I make dishes that can be done ahead of time ó and quickly.  I hate being rushed before meals, especially when guests are on their way over.  Those guests are usually good friends or members of our large family.  Often I'll prepare some of the Russian and Lithuanian recipes passed down from my relatives."

Shullie's lighter take on the classic dish features tomato sauce instead of sour cream.

                            Berber Soft Bread

Recipe By     :Robert Colombi, Paris, France
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  hot water
  7        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Honey -- for serving

Mix flour and salt in processor.  Add 1 cup hot water and 4 tablespoons oil; blend until ball forms.  Remove dough from processor.  Using oiled hands, divide dough into 3 equal pieces.  Roll each piece on lightly floured surface into 9-inch round about 1/4-inch thick.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium (10-inch-diameter) nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add 1 dough round to skillet; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until golden on bottom, about 5 minutes.  Turn bread over; cook until golden on bottom and bread is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Transfer bread to plate.  Tent with foil to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining oil and dough.  Break warm bread into pieces, drizzle with honey, and serve.

This recipe yields three 9-inch rounds.

Comments:  Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: "My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years.  As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married.  I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family."

Reminiscent of lightly fried pita bread, this rustic treat is good for breakfast.  It is named after the first inhabitants of North Africa.

Comments:  Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: &quot;My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years.  As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married.  I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family.&quot;

Reminiscent of lightly fried pita bread, this rustic treat is good for breakfast.  It is named after the first inhabitants of North Africa.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  walnut pieces
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard powder
  3        tablespoons  walnut oil or olive oil
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  Bibb lettuce head -- leaves torn
     2/3           cup  coarsely-crumbled feta cheese - (abt 3 oz)
                        = (or blue cheese)
  2                     oranges

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Scatter nuts on rimmed baking sheet.  Add 2 tablespoons water and sugar; toss until sugar dissolves and syrup coats nuts.  Roast until water evaporates and nuts are crisp, stirring once, about 15 minutes.  Cool on sheet.

Whisk vinegar, orange peel, and mustard in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in walnut and olive oils.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.

Combine lettuce and cheese in large bowl.  Cut peel and pith off oranges.  Cut between membranes, releasing orange segments.  Add segments and walnuts to salad.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Serve, passing remaining dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Carol Gilbert of Saratoga, California, writes: "I've been many things in my life ó including a teacher and a stay-at-home mom ó but now, at 63, I am a one-person technical documentation department for a start-up company.  The hours are not nine to five, so I can't put vast amounts of time into cooking these days, but I have never lost my love for it.  Nevertheless, I cook about five nights a week for myself and my husband, David.  Despite the long days, I want to have a home-cooked meal in the evening.  So, I'm organized: I draw up a weekly menu plan, make a shopping list, and take one trip to the market.  I could not survive without my plan!"

You can substitute Boston or butter lettuce if Bibb isn't available.  Save even more prep time by using packaged candied walnuts or other nuts that are now widely available and are often displayed in the produce or snack aisles of the supermarket.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion - (12 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  yellow bell pepper -- chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cumin seeds
  4          teaspoons  minced canned chipotle chilies

  2               cans  diced tomatoes with roasted garlic - -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  2               cups  vegetable broth

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion, bell pepper, and cumin seeds; sautÈ until onion is soft and golden, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Add chipotle chilies and stir 30 seconds.

Add black beans, diced tomatoes with juices, and vegetable broth; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium.  Simmer uncovered until liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Transfer 2 cups chili to processor.  Blend to coarse paste; return to pot.  Simmer chili to thicken, if desired.  Season chili to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.

              Black Pepper-Crusted Standing Rib Roast Au Jus

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8 1/2         pounds  standing rib roast - (weight with bones) -- top fat trimmed
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  cracked or coarsely-ground black pepper
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4           cups  low-salt beef broth
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
                        Roasted Red Onions -- (see recipe)
  1                     large bunch watercress

Place roast, fat-side up, in roasting pan.  Brush exposed ends of roast with vegetable oil.  Sprinkle roast lightly all over with salt.

Mix 8 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons cracked pepper, minced garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in small bowl.  Reserve 2 tablespoons pepper butter for sauce.  Spread remaining pepper butter all over top (fat side) of roast.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover roast and reserved pepper butter separately; chill.)

Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Roast rib roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 2 hours 45 minutes.  Transfer roast to platter and cover loosely with foil; let rest 30 minutes (temperature will rise slightly as roast stands).

Strain pan juices from roasting pan into measuring cup.  Skim off any fat from top of pan juices; discard fat.  Return pan juices to roasting pan; set pan over 2 burners.  Add broth and wine to roasting pan and boil over high heat until liquid is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, about 6 minutes.  Whisk in reserved pepper butter and remaining 4 tablespoons plain butter.  Season with more salt and pepper, if desired.

Surround roast with Roasted Red Onions.  Garnish with watercress.  Slice roast and serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Boning the roast makes slicing the meat much easier at serving time: Have your butcher remove the backbone, or chine, from the whole rack and cut the meat off the ribs in one piece, then tie the meat back onto the bones.  The roast can be served on or off the bones.  To crack whole peppercorns, enclose them in a resealable plastic bag and crush slightly with a meat mallet.

What to drink:  A medium- to full-bodied red with peppery spice, such as Syrah (called Shiraz if it's from Australia).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE ICING ===
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === WHITE ICING ===
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === CUPCAKES ===
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  buttermilk

For Chocolate Icing:  Bring cream and corn syrup just to simmer in heavy small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and vanilla; whisk until melted and smooth.

For White Icing:  Whisk all ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Let both icings stand 1 1/2 hours at room temperature to thicken.

For Cupcakes:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.  Whisk eggs, vanilla, and lemon peel in medium bowl to blend.  Mix cake flour, baking powder, and salt in another medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until well blended, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl.  Gradually beat in egg mixture.  Beat in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions each.

Divide batter among cups.  Bake until tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool cupcakes in pan on rack 5 minutes.  Remove cupcakes from pan and cool completely.

Spread chocolate icing over half of each cupcake.  Spread white icing on second half of each cupcake.  Let stand until set, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store in single layer in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  1                jar  marshmallow creme - (7 oz)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
  40                    paper or foil candy cups -- (optional)

Line 11- by 7-inch metal baking pan with foil, overlapping sides by 3 inches.  Combine first 4 ingredients in large bowl.

Stir sugar, condensed milk, cream, butter, and salt in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves (no granules will remain when drop of mixture is rubbed between fingertips), occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 10 minutes.

Attach clip-on candy thermometer to side of pan.  Increase heat to high and bring mixture to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-high and stir constantly but slowly with wooden spatula until thermometer registers 230 degrees, about 15 minutes.

Immediately pour mixture over ingredients in bowl (do not scrape pan).  Stir mixture vigorously with wooden spoon until chocolate melts and fudge thickens slightly, about 1 minute.  Transfer mixture to prepared baking pan; smooth top of fudge with rubber spatula.  Sprinkle fudge with chocolate chips.  Refrigerate fudge until firm enough to cut, about 2 hours.

Using foil as aid, lift fudge from pan.  Fold down foil sides.  Trim edges of fudge to even.  Cut into 40 squares or 3 large wide bars.  Place fudge squares in candy cups, if desired.  (Can be made 2 weeks ahead.  Chill in airtight container.  Let stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 40 pieces or 3 bars.

Comments:  The fudge can be cut into three wide bars.  Wrap each in cellophane and tie with ribbon, adding a butter knife to the bow.

  3               cups  whole milk
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces,
                        and at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  Scotch
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

                        Whipped cream
     1/2           cup  English toffee bits

Stir 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan.  Remove from heat.  Add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Stir until smooth.  Set caramel sauce aside.

Mix brown sugar, cornstarch, and salt in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk in milk.  Stir over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and boils, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in caramel sauce.

Whisk egg yolks in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk 1 cup warm caramel mixture into yolks.  Gradually whisk yolk mixture back into caramel mixture in saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Gradually whisk in butter, Scotch, and vanilla.

Divide pudding among 8 parfait glasses.  Chill until cold, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.  Top puddings with banana slices, whipped cream, and toffee bits.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Shirley Brody of Portland, Oregon, writes: "We've enjoyed our evenings at Wildwood Restaurant here in Portland for many years.  Chef and owner Cory Schreiber has created such a great space for the neighborhood.  We would love to have his recipe for butterscotch pudding, which is served in a tall parfait glass.  The dessert's sophisticated look matches its rich flavor."

You'll need to chill the pudding for at least six hours before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PRALINE ===
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  unsalted macadamia nuts -- coarsely chopped
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                can  sweetened cream of coconut - (15 oz)
                        = (such as Coco LÛpez)
  6        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  coconut extract
  1              pinch  salt
                        === PINEAPPLE ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1              small  pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  2              pints  vanilla ice cream

For Praline:  Line 8- by 8-inch baking pan with foil.  Stir sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 7 minutes.  Mix in nuts.  Immediately pour mixture into prepared pan, spreading slightly.  Cool completely.  Peel foil off praline.  Coarsely chop praline.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store refrigerated in airtight container.)

For Sauce:  Bring cream of coconut and cocoa to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking until smooth.  Remove from heat.  Add extracts and salt; whisk to blend.  Cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For Pineapple:  Melt butter and sugar in very large skillet over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high.  Add pineapple and sautÈ until golden, about 3 minutes per side.  Divide pineapple among 8 sundae dishes.  Top each with 1 scoop of ice cream.  Top with sauce and praline.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Test-kitchen tip:  When making the praline topping, do not stir the sugar syrup as it boils. Stirring will cause the melted sugar to crystallize and become grainy.

                        Latin American markets and some
                        supermarkets)
  8             ounces  peeled deveined cooked shrimp -- coarsely chopped
     2/3           cup  soft fresh goat cheese - (abt 4 oz) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  grated Panela cheese - (packed)
                        = (or Monterey Jack cheese)
     1/4           cup  chopped red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallot
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        Red Bell Pepper Sauce II -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh basil leaves -- (optional)

Char poblano chilies over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel chilies.  Using small sharp knife, carefully slit chilies open along 1 side.  Remove seeds, leaving stems attached.

Mix shrimp and next 6 ingredients in medium bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Fill chilies with shrimp mixture, dividing equally.  Pull up sides of chilies to enclose filling.  Place stuffed chilies on baking sheet.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake chilies uncovered until heated through and cheeses melt, about 15 minutes.  Spoon 3 tablespoons Red Bell Pepper Sauce onto each of 8 plates.  Place 1 stuffed chili atop sauce on each.  Garnish with basil leaves, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Instead of Panela, other soft white Mexican cheeses ó such as Oaxaca, or those used for making quesadillas ó ≠≠≠work well in this recipe.  If none is available, substitute Monterey Jack cheese.  The stuffed chilies can be assembled one day before baking.

What to drink:  A Napa or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (or any dry but fruity white wine).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1 1/2         ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-crushed red-and-white-striped
                        hard peppermint candies
  6 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  peppermint extract
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips - (abt 3 oz)
                        Coarsely-crushed peppermints
                        Powdered sugar

Combine first 3 ingredients in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over low heat until chocolates melt and mixture is smooth.  Remove pan from heat.  Mix in finely crushed mints and 6 1/2 tablespoons sugar.  Cool mixture to lukewarm, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Whisk eggs into chocolate mixture, 1 at a time, then whisk in vanilla extract and peppermint extract.  Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in small bowl to blend.  Whisk flour mixture, then chocolate chips into chocolate mixture.  Cover batter and chill until firm enough to shape, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Using 1 generous tablespoonful for each cookie, roll dough between moistened palms into 1 1/4-inch-diameter balls, then arrange on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until puffed and cracked on top but still soft to touch in center, about 11 minutes.  Let stand on sheets 5 minutes.

Press coarsely crushed mints onto tops of cookies or sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Transfer to racks; cool completely.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store airtight between sheets of waxed paper in refrigerator.)

This recipe yields about 36 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  warm water
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
     1/3           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  grated peeled fresh ginger
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  chopped crystallized ginger

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch square metal baking pan.  Line bottom with parchment paper.  Butter parchment.  Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

Mix warm water and baking soda in small bowl until baking soda dissolves.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar, butter, molasses, eggs, and fresh ginger in large bowl until well blended.  Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with water mixture in 2 additions, beating until just combined.  Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool on rack 20 minutes.  Run knife around edge of cake to loosen.  Invert cake onto rack; cool.  Peel off parchment.

For Glaze:  Bring first 3 ingredients to simmer in medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and vanilla; stir until smooth.  Let stand until cool but still pourable, about 20 minutes.

Place cake on rack set atop baking sheet.  Reserve 1/2 cup glaze.  Pour remaining glaze over cake, spreading with spatula to coat top and sides.  Chill cake and reserved glaze until reserved glaze is just firm enough to pipe, about 1 hour.

Transfer reserved glaze to pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain tip.  Pipe 5 diagonal lines atop cake, spacing evenly.  Cluster crystallized ginger atop lines.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 9 to 12 servings.

Comments:  So many German settlers carried their gingerbread treats to small towns around this country that the sweetly spiced cakes and cookies have become an all-American tradition.  Coated with a chocolate ganache glaze, the homey cake of holidays past is transformed into a special-occasion dessert.

Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  34                    foil 1 1/4"-round petit four cups -- see * Note
  16            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  8             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  1           teaspoon  peppermint extract
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
     1/4           cup  coarsely-crushed red-and-white-striped
                        hard peppermint candies
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Candied violets, green candy decors, or
                        coarsely-crushed hard peppermint candies

* Note:  Available at cake and candy supply stores and specialty foods stores.

Place foil cups on baking sheet.  Stir bittersweet chocolate in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water) until chocolate melts and candy thermometer registers 115 degrees.  Remove from over water.  Using 1-inch-wide pastry brush, coat insides of foil cups with enough chocolate to coat thickly to top edge of cups (rewarm chocolate over simmering water as necessary to maintain temperature).  Reserve remaining bittersweet chocolate.  Place cups on baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.

Bring cream to simmer in heavy small saucepan.  Reduce heat to low; add white chocolate and stir until melted and smooth.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in extract, then sour cream.  Cool to barely lukewarm, about 10 minutes.  Mix in 1/4 cup crushed peppermint candies.

Spoon enough white chocolate mixture into center of each chocolate cup to fill to within 1/8 inch of top (about 1 level teaspoonful per cup).  Refrigerate until filling sets, about 30 minutes.

Rewarm remaining melted bittersweet chocolate to 115 degrees in bowl set over barely simmering water.  Spoon enough chocolate (about 1 teaspoon) over filling in each cup to cover completely.  Tap on counter to level.  Top each with candied violet, green candy decor, or crushed peppermint candies.  Chill cups until firm, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 2 weeks ahead; refrigerate in single layer in airtight container.  Let stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 34 pieces.

Comments:  Arrange the candy cups in single layers in decorative boxes lined with tissue paper.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     frozen uncooked lobster tails - (10 oz ea) -- thawed
                        = (or 1 lb freshly-cooked lobster meat,
                        cut into bite-size pieces)
  8               cups  frozen yellow corn kernels -- thawed
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  8                     bacon slices -- chopped
  2               cups  chopped onions

If using thawed frozen lobster tails, cook in pot of boiling water until almost cooked through, about 6 minutes.  Drain.  Cool.  Using kitchen shears, cut lobster shells open.  Remove lobster meat; cut into bite-size pieces.  Discard shells.

Puree 4 cups corn with 1 1/4 cups broth in processor until almost smooth.

SautÈ bacon in large pot over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes.  Transfer bacon to paper towels.  Pour off and discard all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot.

Add onions to pot; sautÈ until light golden, about 5 minutes.  Add remaining 4 cups corn; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add carrots, celery, and cayenne; sautÈ until vegetables soften slightly, about 5 minutes.  Add clam juice and 1 3/4 cups broth; simmer 10 minutes.

Stir in corn puree and whipping cream; simmer 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Lobster, bacon, and soup can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill lobster and bacon separately.  Cool soup slightly; chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.  Bring bacon to room temperature and bring soup to simmer before continuing.)  Remove soup from heat; stir in sour cream.

Melt butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add lobster meat and sautÈ just until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Garnish each serving with lobster pieces, bacon, and chives and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  To cut down on prep time, use cooked lobster meat, available in some fish markets and supermarkets, or follow the directions above for cooking frozen lobster tails.

  1                     yellow bell pepper
  1                     bag fresh or frozen cranberries - (12 oz)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1             medium  jalapeÒo chili -- seeded, chopped
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  2                     ripe avocados -- halved, pitted,
                        peeled, and diced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

Char bell pepper over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and chop bell pepper.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                     box chocolate wafer cookies - (9 oz) -- broken
  2             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  4           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water
  2               cups  fresh cranberries
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Finely grind cookies and chocolate in processor.  Add butter; blend until moist clumps form.  Using plastic wrap as aid, press crumb mixture onto bottom and 1 1/4 inches up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Bake until set, about 8 minutes.  Cool completely.

For Filling:  Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Wrap 2 layers of heavy-duty foil around bottom and up sides of springform pan.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until light.  Beat in flour.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, just until blended.  Beat in orange peel and vanilla.

Pour filling into crust.  Place springform pan in large roasting pan.  Fill roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up sides of springform pan.  Bake until filling is just set in center but still moves slightly, about 55 minutes.  Remove cake from water bath; transfer to rack and cool completely, about 4 hours.  Cover and chill overnight.

For Topping:  Stir sugar and water in medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to medium; add cornstarch mixture and bring to simmer.  Add cranberries; cook until beginning to pop, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Stir in orange peel.  Cool completely.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Cheesecake and cranberry mixture can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Run knife around top edge of cheesecake to loosen.  Release pan sides.  Top cheesecake with cranberry mixture.  Chill until set, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Chocolate wafer cookies (used in the crust) are sometimes located in the ice cream section, displayed above the freezer case.

  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  5 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
     3/4           cup  chopped walnuts
     3/4           cup  chopped unsalted natural pistachios
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh or frozen
                        cranberries

Butter 3 baking sheets.  Combine dried sweetened cranberries and orange juice in small bowl.  Let stand until dried cranberries soften slightly, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Whisk all purpose flour, ground cinnamon, baking powder, ground ginger, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl until just blended.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat room-temperature butter and golden brown sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Add 1 egg, minced ginger, vanilla extract, and grated orange peel and beat until well blended, about 2 minutes.  Beat in flour-spice mixture.  Stir in chopped walnuts, chopped pistachios, coarsely chopped fresh or frozen cranberries, and dried cranberries with any juices that have accumulated.

Drop cookie dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing tablespoonfuls about 1 1/2 inches apart.  Bake cookies, 1 baking sheet at a time, until golden and almost firm to touch in center, about 18 minutes.  Cool cookies on baking sheets 5 minutes.  Transfer to racks; cool cookies completely.  (Cookies can be made 2 days ahead.  Store cookies in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 48 cookies.

Comments:  Bonnie Wilkens Metully of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes: "As much as my husband and I love to go out to eat, it's just more fun, intimate, and cozy to cook and entertain at home.  I've taught a lot of our friends just how easy it is to prepare restaurant-quality dishes themselves.  Who taught me?  My older sister, who's a professional chef.  She showed me the importance of getting everything prepped beforehand and seeking out the freshest ingredients."

This sophisticated appetizer is one of Bonnie's greatest party hits.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  beef broth
     1/2           cup  old-fashioned oats
  1 1/4         pounds  meat loaf mix
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  2        tablespoons  coarse-grained Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Mix 1/2 cup broth and oats in medium bowl.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Mix in meat, onion, egg, dill, mustard, salt, and pepper.  Transfer mixture to rimmed baking sheet; shape into two 3- by 6-inch rectangular loaves.

Bake meat loaves until browned and cooked through and thermometer inserted into center registers 160 degrees, about 25 minutes.  Using large spatula, transfer loaves to platter.

Place baking sheet directly atop 2 burners.  Add remaining 1/2 cup broth to sheet.  Boil pan juices over high heat until reduced by half, scraping up browned bits, about 2 minutes.  Pour sauce over loaves and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Using meat loaf mix ó a combination of ground beef, veal, and pork ó ensures a juicy result.  While the meat loaf cooks, mash some potatoes and boil some green beans.  Warm apple pie from the bakery is a perfect finale.

Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter, vanilla extract, and almond extract.  Blend, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add milk and blend, using on/off turns, until mixture comes together in small clumps.  Transfer 1 cup (packed) mixture to medium bowl and reserve for streusel.  Blend remaining mixture in processor until large moist clumps form.  Gather dough together in large ball.

Press dough over bottom of prepared baking pan; pierce all over with fork.  Bake dough until golden, about 22 minutes; cool crust 15 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Add sweetened coconut flakes and sliced almonds to reserved 1 cup dough.  Mix dough with fork, breaking streusel topping into small clumps.

Spread cherry filling over baked crust.  Sprinkle streusel topping over.  Bake cookie until cherry filling is bubbling and streusel topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Cool cookie in pan on rack.  Using foil overhang as aid, lift cookie from pan.  Peel off foil and discard.  Cut cookie lengthwise into thirds, then cut crosswise into eighths, forming total of 24 bars.  (Bars can be made 2 days ahead.  Store bars in airtight container and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 24 bars.

           Dried Fruit Compote With Port, Cinnamon, And Ginger

Recipe By     :Carol Gilbert, Saratoga, CA
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  ruby Port
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
  2                     bags mixed dried fruits - (8 oz ea) -- large pieces
                        quartered

Combine 1 cup water, Port, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and ginger in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add fruit.  Reduce heat to medium.  Simmer until fruit is tender and syrup thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer compote to bowl.  Cover and chill at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Carol Gilbert of Saratoga, California, writes: "I've been working full-time since my daughter was in high school, but it took about ten years to get over the notion that I should be cooking everything ó the way my mother did ó and climb the corporate ladder.  There's simply not enough time.  I finally realized I didn't have to make everything from scratch; now I give myself permission to buy a dessert or a salad dressing if I need to."

Sweet and spicy, this compote is a great topping for vanilla ice cream.  Carol also serves it with pound cake.  Begin the recipe at least four hours and up to one day ahead.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  whipping cream
     2/3           cup  sugar
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  dark rum

  1              large  pinch salt
     1/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place 11- by 8-inch (8-cup capacity) shallow ceramic baking dish in roasting pan.

Mix cream and 2/3 cup sugar in medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Whisk yolks in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture, then rum, brandy, nutmeg, and salt.  Transfer to baking dish.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dish.  Carefully transfer pan to oven.

Bake until custard is set around edges but center still jiggles slightly when dish is gently shaken, about 40 minutes.  Remove ceramic dish from water.  Chill custard on rack until cold, at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)

Preheat broiler.  Press brown sugar through strainer over custard to cover completely and evenly.  Watching closely, broil custard 4 to 6 inches from heat source until sugar bubbles and caramelizes, about 2 minutes.  Chill custard until topping hardens, at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.  Serve cold.

Comments:  To impart smoky flavor to food when using an outdoor gas grill, add a handful of wood chips (soaked in cold water 30 minutes and drained) to a smoker box and place it under the grates and on top of ceramic briquettes in the far right or left corner of the grill.

Comments:  Shullie Neumark of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, writes: "I like cooking but I'm a little bit impatient, which is why I make dishes that can be done ahead of time ó and quickly.  I hate being rushed before meals, especially when guests are on their way over.  Those guests are usually good friends or members of our large family.  My husband and I emigrated from South Africa seven years ago.  I am retired from preschool teaching, but I still keep busy by cooking for the family.  A typical South African dinner is a barbecue with lots of grilled lamb chops and sausages."

  4                     chicken breast halves with skin and bones

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                     large bunch fresh sage leaves with short s -- (abt 30)
  6             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     2/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  4          teaspoons  salt
  4          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  4             pounds  well-trimmed boneless leg of lamb -- cut 2" cubes
  16                    metal skewers - (12" long)
  32             whole  dried apricots (preferably Mediterranean) -- soaked in boiling
                        water 5 minutes, drained

                        Golden Couscous -- (see recipe)

Whisk first 9 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Transfer 1/2 cup marinade to small bowl; cover, chill, and reserve as basting sauce.  Add lamb to remaining marinade in medium bowl; toss to coat.  Marinate 2 hours at room temperature or cover and refrigerate overnight.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Remove lamb from marinade.  Thread lamb cubes onto 8 skewers, dividing equally.  Thread apricots and onion chunks alternately on remaining 8 skewers.  Brush all skewers with some of reserved 1/2 cup marinade.  Sprinkle onion-apricot skewers with salt and pepper.

Grill onion-apricot skewers until onions soften and begin to brown, occasionally turning and basting with marinade and moving skewers to cooler part of barbecue if necessary to keep apricots from burning, about 10 minutes.  Grill lamb to desired doneness, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes for medium-rare.

Mound Golden Couscous on platter.  Top with skewers and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  6               cups  all-purpose flour -- more or less
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cloves
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  11       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick plus 3 tbspns) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
  2          teaspoons  water
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
                        === ICING ===
  3               cups  powdered sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  light corn syrup
                        Water -- as needed
                        Food coloring -- (optional)
                        Decorations
                        = (such as colored sugar crystals)

For Dough:  Combine 5 1/4 cups flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt in medium bowl; whisk to blend well.

Using electric mixer, beat butter and shortening in large bowl to blend.  Add 1 cup sugar, molasses, and lemon peel and beat until smooth.  Beat in egg and buttermilk.  Stir 2 teaspoons water and baking soda in small cup to blend; beat into butter mixture.

Beat in flour mixture in 2 additions.  Stir in more flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until slightly firm dough forms.  Divide dough into 3 equal parts.  Shape each into disk.  Wrap disks and chill until firm enough to roll, at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Soften slightly before rolling out.)

Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough between sheets of waxed paper to 16- by 12-inch rectangle, occasionally lifting paper to smooth out wrinkles.  Using 4- to 5-inch cutters, cut out boy and girl gingerbread people.  Pull away excess dough around cutouts; flatten, wrap, and chill excess dough.

Slide rimless baking sheet or inverted baking sheet under waxed paper with cutouts and chill until firm.  Repeat with remaining dough disks, refrigerating cutouts on waxed paper on baking sheets.  Roll out excess dough and make more cookies, using all of dough.  (Cutout cookies can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; keep chilled.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Using thin metal spatula, lift chilled cookies off waxed paper and transfer to baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.  Bake until darker at edges and just firm to touch in center, about 12 minutes.  Cool on sheet 5 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool completely.  Bake remaining cookies, 1 sheet at a time.

For Icing:  Sift powdered sugar into medium bowl.  Mix in lemon juice and corn syrup.  Mix in enough water by teaspoonfuls to form smooth icing soft enough to pipe but firm enough to hold shape.  Divide into 3 or 4 portions and tint with food coloring, if desired.

Spoon icing into pastry bag (or bags if using more than 1 color) fitted with small (1/16- to 1/8-inch) plain tip.  Arrange cookies on work surface.  Pipe icing onto cookies in desired patterns.  Apply decorations as desired.  Let cookies stand until icing is dry.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store cookies airtight between sheets of waxed paper at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 50 cookies.

Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  9              whole  graham crackers
     1/2           cup  old-fashioned oats
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  unflavored gelatin
                        = (measured from 2 envelopes)
  12            ounces  Philadelphia-brand cream cheese -- room temperature
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  3               cups  fresh blueberries
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  chilled heavy whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4                     baskets blueberries - (1/2 pint ea)
     2/3           cup  blueberry jam

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until graham crackers are finely ground.  Add butter and vanilla; process until moist crumbs form.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan.  Bake crust until deep golden brown, about 12 minutes.  Cool.

For Filling:  Pour 1/4 cup water into small saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Stir over very low heat just until gelatin dissolves.  Set aside.

Blend cream cheese, cream, sugar, and lemon juice in processor until smooth.  Add berries; puree until smooth (some blueberry bits will remain).  With machine running, add warm gelatin mixture through feed tube and blend well.  Pour filling into crust.  Cover; chill overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)  Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake.  Release pan sides.  Transfer to platter.

For Topping:  Beat cream and sugar in medium bowl until firm peaks form.  Spread cream mixture thickly over top of cheesecake.  Place berries in bowl.  Heat jam in small saucepan over low heat until just melted.  Pour jam over berries; toss to coat.  Mound coated berries in center of cream, leaving 1-inch plain border.  Chill cake at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Chill this overnight to develop the blueberry flavor and give the filling time to set.

Test-kitchen tip:  Whole graham crackers measure 5- by 2 1/4 inches before being broken into four smaller rectangles.

Comments:  Charmaine Haravey of Niwot, Colorado, writes: "I love spending my days in the mountains.  It's one of the reasons that I moved to Boulder County.  But since I started my new job, I don't have as much time to hike, ski, or enjoy my other favorite activity ó cooking.  Spending time in the kitchen has now become a luxury.  Instead of making a complete meal in the evening, I prepare "single-girl food" ó namely cookies, grilled sandwiches, and egg dishes.  But I don't use that expression negatively.  I never miss an opportunity to share a batch of cookies with my friends."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZED ORANGE PEEL ===
  2                     oranges
     2/3           cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  1                cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
                        Powdered sugar
                        === FROSTING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4               cups  powdered sugar

For Glazed Orange Peel:  Using vegetable peeler, remove rind from oranges in strips.  Cut rind into matchstick-size strips.  Place strips in small saucepan; cover with water.  Bring to boil.  Drain; rinse with cold water.  Drain.  Combine 2/3 cup water, sugar, and vinegar in medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Add orange strips; simmer until translucent, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Cool on sheet of foil.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 15- by 10- by 1-inch jelly-roll pan.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; butter parchment.  Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

Heat milk in medium saucepan over medium heat to 150 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and eggs in large bowl until fluffy, about 4 minutes.  Beat in vanilla and grated orange peel.  Beat in flour mixture until just blended.  Gradually beat in warm milk.  Pour batter into pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.  Spread kitchen towel on work surface; cover with parchment.  Sprinkle parchment lightly with powdered sugar.  Run knife around edge of pan to loosen cake.  Invert hot cake onto parchment.  Peel parchment off top of cake.  Starting at 1 long side and using towel as aid, gently roll up cake jelly-roll style.  Cool.

For Frosting:  Using electric mixer, beat first 5 ingredients in large bowl until smooth.  Gradually add powdered sugar, beating until smooth.  Cover and chill until firm but spreadable, about 45 minutes.

Unroll cake; remove second sheet of parchment.  Spread scant 2 cups frosting over cake; starting at 1 long side, roll up jelly-roll style.  Place cake, seam-side down, on platter.

Starting 1 inch in from end of cake, turn knife on sharp diagonal and cut to remove one 3-inch-long triangular piece of cake.  Spread 1 tablespoon frosting on cut side of cake piece.  Attach frosted side of cake piece to side of cake near end.

Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake and cake piece.  Using tines of fork, draw circles on cake ends to resemble tree rings.  Draw fork along length of cake to form bark design.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.  Let stand 2 hours at room temperature before continuing.)  Sprinkle log with glazed orange peel strips.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

I get inspiration from my favorite bedtime reading, an immense collection of cookbooks and food magazines.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BISCUITS ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/4" pieces
     2/3           cup  whole milk -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/2"-thick slices
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar

For Biscuits:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix 1/4 cup sugar and orange peel in small bowl, mashing peel with back of spoon until mixture is pale orange.

Whisk flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl.  Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture forms coarse meal.  Add 2/3 cup milk; stir with fork until dough is evenly moistened, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls if dry.  Drop dough by 1/3 cupfuls onto prepared sheet, forming 8 mounds and spacing 1 1/2 inches apart.  Using fingertips, flatten each biscuit to 2-inch round.  Sprinkle with orange sugar.

Bake biscuits until golden brown and tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 18 minutes; transfer to rack.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cool completely.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Toss peaches, 1/3 cup sugar, and vanilla in large bowl; let stand 15 minutes, tossing occasionally.

Using electric mixer, beat cream and sugar in medium bowl until peaks form.

Using serrated knife, cut each biscuit horizontally in half.  Place bottom halves on plates.  Spoon peaches and their juices onto each biscuit.  Top with whipped cream and biscuit tops.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Test-kitchen tip:  If parchment paper is difficult to find, you can butter and flour the baking sheet instead.

  10            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        == (do not use unsweetened)
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
     1/2           cup  creamy peanut butter
                        = (do not use old-fashioned style or
                        freshly ground)
     1/3           cup  chopped lightly-salted cocktail peanuts
  1 3/4           cups  chopped peanut brittle - (abt 8 oz)
  8             ounces  good-quality milk chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as Ghirardelli)

Turn large baking sheet upside down.  Cover tightly with foil.  Mark 12- by 9-inch rectangle on foil.  Stir bittersweet chocolate in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water) until mixture is melted and candy thermometer registers 115 degrees.

Remove from over water.  Spoon 2 tablespoons melted chocolate into small metal bowl; set aside.  Pour remaining melted chocolate onto marked rectangle on foil.  Using icing spatula, spread chocolate to fill rectangle.  Refrigerate while making peanut butter filling.

Stir chopped white chocolate and peanut butter constantly in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until mixture is melted and smooth.  Remove from heat.  Mix in chopped nuts.  Cool mixture to barely lukewarm, about 10 minutes.  Pour over bittersweet chocolate.  Working quickly, spread to coat bittersweet chocolate completely.  Sprinkle with 3/4 cup chopped brittle.  Chill until very firm, about 20 minutes.

Stir milk chocolate in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of barely simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water) until chocolate is melted and candy thermometer registers 115 degrees.

Remove from over water.  Pour chocolate over brittle, spreading quickly to cover.  Sprinkle with 1 cup brittle.  Rewarm reserved 2 tablespoons bittersweet chocolate over simmering water, stirring until warm.  Dip spoon in chocolate and drizzle lines over brittle.  Chill bark until firm enough to cut, about 20 minutes.

Lift foil with bark onto work surface.  Cut crosswise into 5 approximately 2-inch-wide strips.  Cut each strip crosswise into 4 sections and diagonally into 2 triangles.  (Can be made 2 weeks ahead.  Chill in airtight container.  Let stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 40 pieces.

Comments:  Arrange in boxes lined with waxed paper.  Try simple take-out cartons tied up with raffia and decorated with small pinecones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  oriental sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                     green onion -- minced
  2          teaspoons  wasabi paste -- see * Note
                        = (horseradish paste)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  red bell peppers
  2              large  yellow or orange bell peppers
  2                     yellow Hungarian peppers
                        = (also called Hungarian wax chiles or
                        banana chiles)
                        Toasted sesame seeds

* Note:  Wasabi paste is available at Asian markets and in tubes in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Combine first 7 ingredients in small bowl; whisk to blend well.  (Vinaigrette can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature and rewhisk before using.)

Remove grill rack from barbecue.  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rake coals into even layer.  Allow coals to burn until just beginning to turn ash-gray.

Place peppers directly on coals.  Cook until peppers are blackened on all sides, turning frequently with tongs, about 7 minutes.  Transfer peppers to bowl; cover with plastic wrap.  Cool peppers to room temperature.  Peel and seed peppers, then cut into 2- by 1-inch pieces.

Arrange peppers on platter.  Spoon vinaigrette over; sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The peppers are roasted directly in the embers, but they can also be roasted on a grill rack with delicious results.  Serve this as a starter, or pair with grilled fish.

             Phyllo-Wrapped Figs With Prosciutto And Stilton

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16         teaspoons  Stilton cheese - (abt 4 oz)
  32                    dried black Mission figs
  4                     thin prosciutto slices, 6" by 4" -- halved lengthwise
  8                     sheets fresh phyllo pastry or frozen -- thawed
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- melted
  2               cups  ruby Port
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  4 1/2    tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted

Form 2 teaspoons cheese into 1-inch-long log.  Place 4 dried figs around cheese and press gently to adhere.  Wrap 1 prosciutto strip around fig bundle.  Repeat with remaining cheese, figs, and prosciutto.

Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap and damp towel).  Brush phyllo lightly with melted butter.  Top with second phyllo sheet; brush with butter.  Repeat with 2 more phyllo sheets.  Cut stacked phyllo sheets into four 6-inch squares (discard phyllo trimmings).

Place 1 fig bundle in center of 1 phyllo square stack.  Bring all edges of phyllo square up toward center and squeeze firmly at top, forming pouch and enclosing fig bundle completely.  Place on baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets, melted butter, and fig bundles, forming a total of 8 pouches.

Brush outside of phyllo pouches with remaining melted butter.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake pouches until golden, about 17 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring Port, balsamic vinegar, and sugar to boil in medium saucepan.  Boil until mixture is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes.

While Port mixture is being reduced, boil cream and pine nuts in another medium saucepan until reduced to 1 cup, about 8 minutes.  Remove cream sauce from heat; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon 2 tablespoons cream sauce onto each of 8 plates.  Place 1 phyllo pouch atop sauce.  Drizzle each lightly with Port sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Gail W. Dorsey of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, writes: "Fresh figs were featured in an unusual appetizer at The Gatehouse Restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island.  The figs were stuffed with cheese, wrapped in phyllo, and served with two sauces.  They would make an impressive starter for a dinner party."

This is terrific made with fresh figs when they're in season.  But dried ones, which are readily available year-round, work well, too.

<DirT>
Place 1 fig bundle in center of 1 phyllo square stack.  Bring all edges of phyllo square up toward center and squeeze firmly at top, forming pouch and enclosing fig bundle completely.  Place on baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets, melted butter, and fig bundles, forming a total of 8 pouches.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush outside of phyllo pouches with remaining melted butter.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake pouches until golden, about 17 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, bring Port, balsamic vinegar, and sugar to boil in medium saucepan.  Boil until mixture is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While Port mixture is being reduced, boil cream and pine nuts in another medium saucepan until reduced to 1 cup, about 8 minutes.  Remove cream sauce from heat; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 2 tablespoons cream sauce onto each of 8 plates.  Place 1 phyllo pouch atop sauce.  Drizzle each lightly with Port sauce and serve.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Gail W. Dorsey of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, writes: &quot;Fresh figs were featured in an unusual appetizer at The Gatehouse Restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island.  The figs were stuffed with cheese, wrapped in phyllo, and served with two sauces.  They would make an impressive starter for a dinner party.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
This is terrific made with fresh figs when they&apos;re in season.  But dried ones, which are readily available year-round, work well, too.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
  8             ounces  raspberries - (abt 1 3/4 cups)
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  3               cups  fresh raspberries - (abt 12 oz)
  2 1/2           cups  fresh blueberries - (abt 12 oz)
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  tapioca
     1/4           cup  crËme de cassis
                        = (black-currant-flavored liqueur)
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  milk
  2        tablespoons  raw sugar -- see * Note
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

* Note:  Also called turbinado or demerara sugar; available at natural foods stores and most supermarkets.

Whisk flour and salt in large bowl.  Add butter and shortening and rub in with fingertips until pea-size pieces form.  Add sour cream and 3 tablespoons ice water.  Stir just until dough comes together.  Gather dough into ball and divide into 2 pieces.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spray 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with nonstick spray.  Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round.  Line prepared pie dish with dough.  Roll out remaining disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round.

Mix raspberries, blueberries, 1 cup sugar, tapioca, and crËme de cassis in large bowl.  Spoon berry mixture into crust-lined pie dish.  Top with second crust, trimming excess dough.  Crimp edges together.  Cut 3/4-inch hole in center of top crust.

Whisk egg and milk in small bowl to blend.  Brush some of mixture over crust.  Sprinkle with raw sugar.  Bake pie 15 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Continue baking until crust browns and juices bubble thickly (cover crust with foil after 30 minutes to prevent overbrowning), about 1 hour.

Cool about 2 hours.  (Pie can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)  Cut pie into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Susan Zubert of Rochester, New York, writes: "Whenever my husband and I get to Maui we make a point of eating at one of our favorite restaurants, David Paul's Lahaina Grill.  During our last visit, my husband ordered a fabulous berry pie.  He enjoyed it so much that I was concerned he was going to pick up the plate and lick it clean.  I would love to have the recipe."

Fresh berries and crËme de cassis (made with black currants) fill this flavorful pie.  The addition of sour cream makes the crust exceptionally tender.

Whisk flour and salt in large bowl.  Add butter and shortening and rub in with fingertips until pea-size pieces form.  Add sour cream and 3 tablespoons ice water.  Stir just until dough comes together.  Gather dough into ball and divide into 2 pieces.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before continuing.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spray 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with nonstick spray.  Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round.  Line prepared pie dish with dough.  Roll out remaining disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix raspberries, blueberries, 1 cup sugar, tapioca, and crËme de cassis in large bowl.  Spoon berry mixture into crust-lined pie dish.  Top with second crust, trimming excess dough.  Crimp edges together.  Cut 3/4-inch hole in center of top crust.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk egg and milk in small bowl to blend.  Brush some of mixture over crust.  Sprinkle with raw sugar.  Bake pie 15 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees.  Continue baking until crust browns and juices bubble thickly (cover crust with foil after 30 minutes to prevent overbrowning), about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cool about 2 hours.  (Pie can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)  Cut pie into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Susan Zubert of Rochester, New York, writes: &quot;Whenever my husband and I get to Maui we make a point of eating at one of our favorite restaurants, David Paul&apos;s Lahaina Grill.  During our last visit, my husband ordered a fabulous berry pie.  He enjoyed it so much that I was concerned he was going to pick up the plate and lick it clean.  I would love to have the recipe.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fresh berries and crËme de cassis (made with black currants) fill this flavorful pie.  The addition of sour cream makes the crust exceptionally tender.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream
     3/4           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and coarsely chopped
  4        tablespoons  raspberry preserves

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter and blend, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 3/4 cup cream.  Blend, using on/off turns, just until dough comes together.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup nuts.  Gently knead with 4 or 5 turns to mix in nuts.  Divide dough into 4 equal pieces; shape each into ball.  Press out each to 6-inch round (about 1/4 inch thick).  Spread preserves over 2 rounds, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Place 1 plain dough round atop each preserve-covered round; seal edges.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap in plastic and chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter large baking sheet.

Place rounds on work surface.  Brush each with 1 tablespoon remaining cream; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup nuts, dividing equally and pressing to adhere.  Using large knife, cut each round into 6 wedges.

Arrange wedges on prepared sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.  Bake scones until puffed and deep golden, about 16 minutes.  Transfer to platter or napkin-lined basket.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 scones.

Comments:  Make and shape the dough one day ahead for convenience, then just transfer from fridge to oven 20 minutes before serving.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  Bosc pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/3           cups  half-and-half
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Butter 9-inch cast-iron skillet.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Add pears, rounded-side down, to skillet and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Spoon syrup over pears.  Transfer skillet to oven and roast pears until tender, turning and basting once, about 10 minutes.

Remove skillet from oven and bring pear mixture to boil over high heat; boil until almost all juices have evaporated, about 2 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Place eggs, half-and-half, and vanilla in blender and process until smooth.  Add flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and pinch of salt; blend to combine.  Pour batter over pears in skillet.  Bake until center is set and clafouti is puffed and golden brown at edges, about 40 minutes.

Mix remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon in small bowl.  Sprinkle over clafouti; serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The French dessert that's known as clafouti is a pancake crossed with a fruit-filled custard.  It's best served warm, right from the skillet.  If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, any ovenproof variety is fine.  Serve with vanilla ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  small red onions - (abt 9) -- halved through
                        root end, cut 3/4"-wide wedges with
                        some of core attached to each
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Position 1 rack in bottom third and 1 rack in top third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with foil; butter foil generously.

Arrange onion wedges cut-side down on prepared sheets.  Brush onions with melted butter.  Mix thyme, salt, and pepper in small bowl; sprinkle over onions.  Drizzle with vinegar.  Cover baking sheets tightly with foil.  Roast onions 20 minutes.  Reverse baking sheets from top to bottom and continue to roast until bottoms of onion wedges are brown, about 20 minutes longer.  Remove foil.

Using spatula, turn onion wedges over; cover with foil and roast until bottoms of onions are brown and edges are slightly crisp, reversing position of baking sheets after 5 minutes, about 15 minutes total.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate onions on sheets, covered.  Rewarm uncovered in 350 degree oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You can cook the onions up to one day ahead. Just before serving time, rewarm them in the oven while the roast rests.

This recipe is an accompaniment for Black Pepper-Crusted Standing Rib Roast au Jus (see recipe).

<DirT>
Arrange onion wedges cut-side down on prepared sheets.  Brush onions with melted butter.  Mix thyme, salt, and pepper in small bowl; sprinkle over onions.  Drizzle with vinegar.  Cover baking sheets tightly with foil.  Roast onions 20 minutes.  Reverse baking sheets from top to bottom and continue to roast until bottoms of onion wedges are brown, about 20 minutes longer.

Using spatula, turn onion wedges over; cover with foil and roast until bottoms of onions are brown and edges are slightly crisp, reversing position of baking sheets after 5 minutes, about 15 minutes total.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate onions on sheets, covered.  Rewarm uncovered in 350 degree oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.)

Comments:  You can cook the onions up to one day ahead. Just before serving time, rewarm them in the oven while the roast rests.

                     Spaghetti With Garlic And Cumin

Recipe By     :Robert Colombi, Paris, France
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  12            ounces  spaghetti
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Mix first 5 ingredients in small bowl; set aside.

Cook spaghetti in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain spaghetti, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid.

Return pasta to pot.  Add oil mixture and toss over medium heat to coat, about 1 minute, adding reserved cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if dry.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: "My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years.  I learned how to cook mostly from my mother (which is why pasta often turns up at dinnertime), but also from my many travels throughout Morocco (which is why my favorite spices are coriander, thyme, and cumin).  As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married.  I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family."

Comments:  Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: &quot;My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years.  I learned how to cook mostly from my mother (which is why pasta often turns up at dinnertime), but also from my many travels throughout Morocco (which is why my favorite spices are coriander, thyme, and cumin).  As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married.  I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family.&quot;

       Spice-Rubbed Pork In Corn Husks With Cranberry-Avocado Salsa

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  cumin seeds
  2          teaspoons  coriander seeds
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
  1              large  shallot -- minced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  3 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloins -- trimmed, and
                        cut crosswise into 8 equal logs
  12                    dried corn husks -- soaked in warm
                        water for 1 hour, drained, patted dry
                        Cranberry-Avocado Salsa -- (see recipe)

Stir cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and black peppercorns in small dry skillet over medium heat until aromatic, about 2 minutes.  Finely grind spice mixture in spice grinder or mini processor.  Mix ground spices, shallot, olive oil, salt, and garlic in small bowl until paste forms.  Rub pork on all sides with spice paste.  Cover and chill at least 3 hours or overnight.

Tear 4 corn husks lengthwise into strips 1/2- to 3/4-inch wide.  Place 1 pork tenderloin log in center of each remaining corn husk.  Wrap corn husks around pork and tie center and ends of each with corn husk strips as for tamales, enclosing pork completely.  Place pork bundles on rack on baking sheet.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with damp kitchen towel, then foil, and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake pork bundles uncovered until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of each piece registers 150 degrees, 35 to 45 minutes, depending on thickness of pork.

Place 1 pork bundle on each of 8 plates.  Remove husk strip from 1 end of each; fold corn husk back slightly, exposing some of meat.  Spoon Cranberry-Avocado Salsa alongside and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Tamales are traditionally served in the southwestern United States and in Mexico at Christmas.  In this easy do-ahead version, corn husks are wrapped around spicy pieces of pork tenderloin.  The husks keep the pork tender and juicy as it cooks.

What to drink:  Pinot Noir.

     2/3           cup  water
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1 1/2           cups  walnuts -- toasted, chopped
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
                        Orange peel in thin strips
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.

Sift first 8 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and oil in large bowl until well blended, about 2 minutes.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add pumpkin and vanilla; beat until blended.  Gradually add dry ingredients; beat just until incorporated.  Divide batter between prepared pans; smooth top with spatula.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on racks.  Run small knife around cakes to loosen.  Turn cakes out onto racks.

For Icing And Filling:  Stir rum, raisins, and dried cranberries in small saucepan over low heat just until warm, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat; let stand 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving rum and fruit separately.

Whisk whipping cream and cream cheese in small bowl until smooth.  Combine sugar and 2/3 cup water in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with pastry brush dipped in water and swirling pan, about 10 minutes.  Slowly and carefully whisk in cream cheese mixture (caramel mixture will bubble vigorously).  Add butter; whisk until mixture is smooth, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat; cool caramel icing 10 minutes, whisking occasionally.

Pour 3/4 cup warm caramel icing mixture into bowl.  Mix in half of reserved dried fruit mixture, 1 cup walnuts, and grated orange peel.  Place 1 cake layer on 8-inch-diameter tart pan bottom or cardboard round.  Brush top of cake with half of reserved rum.  Spread caramel-nut filling over, leaving 1/2-inch plain border at edges.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down; press to adhere.  Brush top of cake with remaining rum; let stand 10 minutes to allow rum to soak in.

Pour generous 1/2 cup warm caramel icing onto cake and, if necessary, spread over top with offset spatula to cover.  Refrigerate cake and remaining caramel icing until icing is firm enough to spread and to adhere to sides of cake, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.

Transfer 3/4 cup chilled icing to small bowl and chill for sauce.  Using offset spatula, spread remaining 1 cup icing evenly over sides of cake to cover.  Mix remaining dried fruit mixture and remaining 1/2 cup walnuts in another small bowl.  Sprinkle mixture in 1 1/2-inch-wide border around top edge of cake.  Cover cake with cake dome and chill at least 6 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep cake and caramel icing for sauce chilled separately.)

Place cake on platter.  Garnish with orange peel.  Rewarm icing over low heat just until pourable.  Serve cake cold with ice cream and warm caramel sauce.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  unsalted butter - (2 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  whole milk
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
                        Assorted decorations
                        = (such as powdered sugar, icing, colored
                        sugar crystals, and edible glitter)
     2/3           cup  preserves
                        = (such as apricot, seedless raspberry,
                        or seedless blackberry)

Whisk flour and salt in medium bowl to blend well.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and 2/3 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in milk, lemon peel, and vanilla extract.  Add flour mixture and beat until blended.  Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Flatten into disks.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.  Let soften slightly before rolling out.)

Roll out each dough disk between sheets of waxed paper to 14- by 11-inch rectangle, occasionally lifting waxed paper to smooth out wrinkles.  Refrigerate dough on baking sheets, still between sheets of waxed paper, until cold and firm, about 30 minutes.

Place 1 dough piece on work surface.  Peel off top sheet of waxed paper.  Press same waxed paper gently back onto dough.  Turn dough over (still between waxed paper sheets).  Peel off top sheet of waxed paper and discard.

Using 2 1/4-inch scalloped round cutter and with dough still on waxed paper bottom, cut out cookies.  Using 1- to 1 1/4-inch scalloped round cutter, cut out center from half of cookies.

Gather dough centers and excess dough around cutouts; shape excess dough into disk and chill.  Slide waxed paper with cutouts onto baking sheet and chill.

Repeat with remaining dough disk, cutting out rounds, cutting centers from half of rounds to make top rings, and gathering and chilling excess dough.  Roll out excess dough between sheets of waxed paper, making more cookie bottoms and top rings.  Repeat rolling and cutting until all of dough is used.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Spray 2 large baking sheets with nonstick spray.

Using metal spatula to lift cutouts from waxed paper, transfer cookie bottoms to 1 prepared sheet and top rings to second sheet, spacing slightly apart (cookies spread very little).  Sprinkle some top rings with colored sugar crystals (or leave plain to decorate later).

Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until pale golden, about 8 minutes.  Cool cookies on baking sheets 5 minutes.  Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely.

Arrange cookie bottoms on work surface.  Spread each with 1 teaspoon preserves.  Sift powdered sugar over plain cookie rings or decorate with icing and sugar crystals or edible glitter as desired.  Press 1 top ring onto each prepared cookie bottom.  (Cookies can be made 3 days ahead.  Store airtight between sheets of waxed paper in refrigerator.)

This recipe yields about 32 cookies.

Comments:  Essentially, these are old-fashioned sugar cookies all dressed up for the holidays.  If you want to use icing for decoration, follow the directions for the icing in the New England Molasses Gingerbread Cookies recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  purchased fresh tortellini
  12                    bacon slices -- coarsely chopped
  1              pound  crimini mushrooms -- sliced
  2               cups  chopped onions
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage leaves
  4              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  whipping cream
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Cook tortellini in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.

SautÈ bacon in large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and brown.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from skillet.

Transfer pasta to serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 6 main-course servings.

I get inspiration from my favorite bedtime reading, an immense collection of cookbooks and food magazines.  I also do a quick grocery run every day ó usually because I've just read about a dish that I simply must try ó but also because having a well-stocked refrigerator is the key to easier cooking."

Categories    : Appetizers                      Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  finely-grated sharp white cheddar cheese -- (abt 6 oz)
     3/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  dried rubbed sage
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of 17.3-oz package)

Mix first 4 ingredients in small bowl.

Roll out puff pastry on lightly floured work surface to 18- by 10-inch rectangle (pastry will be thin).  Sprinkle 1/3 of cheese mixture evenly over half of pastry; fold plain half of pastry over cheese, forming 10- by 9-inch rectangle; press to adhere.  Repeat 2 more times, rolling to 18- by 10-inch rectangle, sprinkling with 1/3 of cheese mixture, and folding.  Roll out pastry again to 18- by 10-inch rectangle.  Transfer to unlined baking sheet.  Chill 30 minutes.

Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 425 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Cut pastry crosswise in half, forming two 10- by 9-inch rectangles.  Trim and discard uneven edges of pastry.  Cut each rectangle crosswise into scant 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Twist each strip a few times and place on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch apart, dabbing ends lightly with water and pressing to adhere to parchment.

Bake twists until golden brown, reversing position of sheets halfway through baking, about 10 minutes total.  Cool twists on sheets.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover twists on sheets tightly with foil and store at room temperature.  If desired, rewarm uncovered in 350 degree oven until heated through, about 5 minutes.)

Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 36 twists.

Comments:  Purchased puff pastry simplifies this flavorful starter.

What to drink: Open a bottle of Champagne or Sancerre to pour with the cheese twists and the Corn and Lobster Chowder.

  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- diced
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  whole milk
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Blend 5 seconds.  Add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add egg and cream and process until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap dough disk in plastic and chill 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.  Let dough soften slightly before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim overhang to 1/2 inch; fold in and press, forming double-thick sides.  Pierce dough all over with fork.  Bake until golden, about 25 minutes.  Transfer baked crust to rack.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

For Filling:  Bring whipping cream and milk to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.  Whisk eggs, sugar, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk chocolate mixture into egg mixture.  Pour filling into warm crust.

Bake tart until filling is set in center and puffed at edges, about 25 minutes.  Transfer to rack and let cool 15 minutes.  Serve warm.  (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cool completely, then cover and refrigerate.  Before serving, reheat in 350 degree oven 10 minutes or microwave individual slices at 5-second intervals until warm.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 3/4           cups  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast (from 2 envelopes)
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (about) -- plus
     1/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  corn oil
  1              pound  pitted dates -- chopped
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for glaze

Whisk 2 3/4 cups warm water and molasses in large bowl to blend.  Sprinkle yeast over.  Let stand until foamy, about 6 minutes.

Whisk whole wheat flour and salt into yeast mixture.  Whisk in 1 cup unbleached flour.  Using flexible rubber spatula, stir in 4 cups unbleached flour.  Mix in enough unbleached flour by 1/4 cupfuls to form sticky dough.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface.  Knead until smooth and only slightly sticky, adding more flour if very sticky, about 8 minutes.

Coat inside of another large bowl with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.  Add dough and turn dough to coat with oil.  Cover bowl with plastic.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

Punch down dough; shape into ball.  Cover with plastic and let dough rise again in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Toss dates with 1/3 cup unbleached flour in medium bowl to coat.  Scatter dates over dough.  Knead dough in bowl to distribute dates evenly.  Divide dough into 4 equal pieces.  Divide each piece into 6 equal pieces about the size of small lemons.  Using floured hands, shape each dough piece into small ball.  Transfer dough balls to prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Cover with kitchen towels and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.

Position racks in bottom third and top third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Brush tops of rolls with egg glaze.  Bake until rolls sound hollow when tapped on bottom, reversing sheets once, about 20 minutes.  Transfer rolls to racks; cool completely.  (Date rolls can be prepared up to 4 days ahead.  Wrap in foil and freeze.  Thaw rolls in foil.)

This recipe yields 24 rolls.
