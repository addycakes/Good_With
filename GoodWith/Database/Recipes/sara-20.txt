  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
  4               cups  uncooked converted white rice -- no substitute

Bring water to rapid boil in large (4 1/2-quart) heavy saucepan over high heat.  Add rice, stir well, then return to rapid bowl.  Adjust heat so water stays at gentle but steady ripple and cook uncovered until all water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Do not stir.  Fluff rice gently with fork and cool 1 hour.  Do not cover.  Fluff rice gently again, then spoon lightly "do not pack" into plastic storage containers, snap on lids, label and date.  Set in refrigerator or freezer.

To reheat refrigerated or frozen rice, pile rice in large fine sieve, fork lightly to separate, and balance sieve on top of large, heavy saucepan over 2 inches boiling water.  Cover loosely with lid or foil and steam just until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes, but times will vary according to amount of rice being reheated and whether itís refrigerated or frozen.  Fluff with fork and serve.

This recipe yields 16 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SYRUP ===
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  1 3/4           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  rose water
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  blanched whole almonds
  1 1/4           cups  confectionersí sugar
  1         tablespoon  water
  2             pounds  medjool dates -- pitted
                        === TO FINISH ===
                        Granulated sugar -- for dredging

Place the granulated sugar in a medium-size saucepan with the water and turn the heat to high, stirring until the water and sugar are very syrupy, about 230 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 25 minutes.  Stir in the rose water and turn off the heat.

Place the almonds in a food processor and grind until fine.  Transfer the almonds to a medium-size bowl and add the confectionersí sugar and 1 tablespoon water to form a dough with your hands.  The dough does not have to be homogenous like a bread dough, just sticky enough so that a thimbleful amount will all hold together.

Stuff the dates with the filling.  Plunge the stuffed dates, holding them with thin tongs or chopsticks, into the sugar syrup, let excess syrup drip off, and then roll the dates in the granulated sugar and set aside on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet or jelly roll pan.

Refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 weeks until needed but serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fragrant almond oil
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened to
                        room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  12            ounces  almond paste -- cut into pieces
  2              large  lemons -- zested and juiced
  5              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  flour -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Using a tablespoon or so of the almond oil, lightly oil the bottom of an 8-inch cake pan.  Line with a round of parchment, lightly oil this with another tablespoon or so of the oil and then dust with flour shaking out the excess.

With an electric mixer beat the butter, remaining oil (you should have around 1/3 cup) and sugar together until fluffy, about 4 minutes.  Add the almond paste, lemon zest and juice and beat until smooth.  Beat in the eggs 1 at a time making sure each is fully incorporated before adding the next.  Fold in the flour and baking powder.

Pour batter in prepared pan and bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 50 to 55 minutes or until a cake tester comes out nearly clean.  While cake is baking, combine glaze ingredients in a small saucepan and over moderate heat stir until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool.

When cake is done, cool on a rack for 15 minutes and then turn cake out to cool completely.  Transfer cake, top-side up to a plate and brush glaze over the top so that it soaks in completely.  Cake can be made up to 2 days ahead.  Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2             medium  firm-ripe avocados
  4               cups  mixed young savory greens, such as cress,
                        arugula, red mustard, mizuna, etc. -- (moderately packed)
                        === PISTACHIO OIL VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  honey -- or to taste

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     McIntosh apples
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- cut into bits
  2        tablespoons  light rum
  4                     cinnamon sticks - (3" ea)
                        Mint leaves, for garnish,
                        if desired

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Peel and core the apples, leaving them whole.  Slice the apples horizontally into even 1/4-inch-thick slices, reassemble the slices to form whole apple shapes, and brush the apples with the lemon juice.  Put the apples in a pie plate, fill the cavities with some of the brown sugar, butter, and rum, and sprinkle the apples with the remaining brown sugar, butter, and rum.

Bake the apples in the middle of the oven, basting frequently, for 25 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees, insert the cinnamon sticks in the cavities of the apples, and bake the apples, basting frequently, for 20 minutes more, or until they are tender and browned well and the juices are thick and syrupy.

Divide the apples among 4 plates, spoon the syrup over them, and garnish the apples with the mint leaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cake flour (not self-rising) or
                        all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  whole milk
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
                        Butter -- for accompaniment

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Into a large bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Cut butter into bits and with your fingertips or a pastry blender blend butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add milk and heavy cream, stirring with a wooden spoon until just combined (mixture will be wet).

Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and with floured hands turn dough to coat evenly.  Knead dough gently 4 to 6 times, or just until smooth (do not overwork dough).  Pat or roll out dough into an 8-inch round (slightly more than 1/2-inch thick).

Using a floured 2- to 2 1/2-inch star-shaped or round cutter cut out biscuits and arrange about 1-inch apart on baking sheets.  Gently pat out or roll out dough scraps and cut out more biscuits in same manner.

Bake biscuits, 1 sheet at a time, in middle of oven until pale golden and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.  Transfer biscuits as baked to a basket lined with a cloth and cover with cloth to keep warm and moist.

Serve biscuits with butter.

This recipe yields 16 to 24 biscuits.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lean pork spareribs -- well trimmed
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  thin soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  black soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  ground bean sauce
  1         tablespoon  Shao Hsing rice cooking wine
  1         tablespoon  oyster flavored sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3        tablespoons  honey
                        Cilantro sprigs -- (optional)

Cut the spareribs into 2 equal pieces.  Remove any visible fat pockets.  Lightly score the spareribs in the meat side and place them in a large, shallow bowl.  Sprinkle sugar on both sides of ribs, using more on the meaty side.  Set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.  Pour off any excess liquid.

In a small bowl combine the thin and black soy sauces, hoisin sauce, bean sauce, rice wine, oyster sauce, sesame oil and pepper and stir to combine.  Pour over the spareribs, making sure that the spareribs are well-coated.  Loosely cover the ribs with plastic wrap and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.

Just before roasting, use your hands to spread honey on the spareribs, especially on the meaty side.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Place a rack in a roasting pan and add enough water so that the water reaches a depth of 1/2-inch in the pan.  Place the marinated spareribs meat-side up on the rack, leaving about 1-inch of space between the 2 pieces.  Carefully place the pan in the oven and roast 30 minutes.  Monitor the water level in the broiler pan to make sure it never falls below 1/4-inch.

Carefully remove the roasting pan of ribs from the oven.  Preheat the broiler.  Place the roasting pan of ribs 4 inches from the heat and broil 5 to 10 minutes or until the spareribs have a sugar crust similar to the crust on a baked ham.  Carefully remove the spareribs from the oven and set on a platter to cool 15 minutes.

Cut the spareribs into individual ribs and serve immediately or at room temperature.  Garnish with cilantro if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  beef short ribs -- cut 1-rib pieces
                        if necessary
                        All-purpose flour -- seasoned with salt
                        and pepper for dredging
     1/4           cup  rendered bacon fat
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  6              small  onions - (abt 1 lb total) -- unpeeled, chopped
  6                     carrots -- sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crumbled
  1                cup  red wine
  3               cups  beef broth

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Dredge ribs in flour, knocking off excess.  Heat bacon fat in a 6-quart heavy ovenproof kettle over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Brown the short ribs in batches in a single layer without crowding.  Transfer short ribs as browned with tongs to a large plate.

Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons bacon fat remaining in kettle and in it cook garlic, onions, carrots, and rosemary with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until browned lightly.  Deglaze the kettle with red wine.  Add the beef broth to the vegetable mixture and bring to a boil, stirring.  Return ribs to the kettle, squeezing them to fit in a single layer, if possible, and cover kettle with a lid.  Braise ribs in oven until tender, about 2 hours.

Transfer ribs with tongs to a platter and keep warm.  Pour cooking liquid through a fine sieve set over a saucepan, discarding solids, and skim fat.  If necessary, boil liquid to thicken it slightly, and spoon sauce over ribs.  Serve with boiled new potatoes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Dredge ribs in flour, knocking off excess.  Heat bacon fat in a 6-quart heavy ovenproof kettle over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Brown the short ribs in batches in a single layer without crowding.  Transfer short ribs as browned with tongs to a large plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons bacon fat remaining in kettle and in it cook garlic, onions, carrots, and rosemary with salt and pepper to taste over moderate heat, stirring, until browned lightly.  Deglaze the kettle with red wine.  Add the beef broth to the vegetable mixture and bring to a boil, stirring.  Return ribs to the kettle, squeezing them to fit in a single layer, if possible, and cover kettle with a lid.  Braise ribs in oven until tender, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer ribs with tongs to a platter and keep warm.  Pour cooking liquid through a fine sieve set over a saucepan, discarding solids, and skim fat.  If necessary, boil liquid to thicken it slightly, and spoon sauce over ribs.  Serve with boiled new potatoes.

             Braised Pork Fillets With Prunes And Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Marie Ostrosky
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18             large  dried pitted prunes
  2               cups  dry white wine
  6                     pork rib chops, 1 1/2" thick
                        Canola oil
     1/4           cup  diced carrot
     1/4           cup  diced celery
     1/4           cup  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 3 tbspns)
  1                cup  heavy cream or crËme fraiche
  2          teaspoons  red currant jelly
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley

Simmer the prunes in the wine over moderate heat, covered, until plump and tender, about 10 minutes.  Strain and reserve the red wine.

Bone and tie the pork fillets.  Saute the fillets in the oil until they are a rich golden brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer fillets to a plate.  Add the mirepoix and the bones to the pan and saute to brown lightly, 8 to 10 minutes.  (Additional oil may have to be added to keep the mirepoix from burning.)

Add the wine from the prunes and deglaze the pan.  Place the pork fillets on top of the mirepoix (the liquid should come part way up the pork chops), cover, and simmer gently over very low heat or until the fillets are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 5 to 8 minutes.

Place the fillets in an oven pre-heated to 325 and immediately turn off the heat.  The meat should be cooked within 10 and 15 minutes.  Take care not to overcook the pork.  Use tongs to transfer the meat to a heated platter and remove the strings.  Arrange three prunes on each fillet, then cover the fillets with foil.

Pour the rest of the contents of the pan through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing down on the vegetables to extract all the juices.  Return the juices to the pan and reduce by half rapidly, stirring and scraping any brown bits that cling to the pan.  Add the cream and continue to boil down rapidly until the color becomes a light beige and the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Whisk in the jelly and continue to cook, whisking, until the jelly is dissolved.  Taste and correct seasoning of the sauce.  Spoon the sauce over the fillets, sprinkle with minced parsley, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  chicken -  cut into pieces
                        Water -- as needed
  1                     blade of mace, or a pinch ground mace
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1                     lemon peel -- grated
  1                cup  broth in which the chicken was cooked
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                     lemon -- cut very thin slices
                        for garnish

Gently poach the chicken in enough water to barely cover the pieces, together with the mace and salt.  When done, cool to touch; remove the meat from the bones and cut into bite-size pieces.

Melt the butter, add the chicken pieces, stir and fry for a few minutes.  Add parsley, lemon juice, grated peel, and broth.  Add some freshly ground, preferably white pepper.  Gently simmer for 10 minutes.  Add cream and reheat the sauce but do not boil.  If desired, the sauce could be further thickened with cornstarch or flour, but it is very good this way.

Garnish your dish with the lemon slices.  Serve with boiled potatoes, a mixture of peas and snow peas, and a salad.

  12                    natural licorice sticks, cinnamon sticks,
                        or bamboo skewers, each 6" long
  6                     Lady apples -- stems removed
  6                     Seckel pears -- stems removed
  2               cups  granola
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  water
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  heavy cream

Insert a licorice stick, cinnamon stick, or bamboo skewer into the stem end of each apple and pear.  Spread the granola on a baking sheet; reserve.  Have ready 1 or more cooling racks or a large sheet of parchment paper for cooling the caramel fruits.

In a saucepan over low heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, vanilla extract, and water.  Cook, stirring, until the sugar melts.  Add the butter and cream, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the caramel registers 240 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool for 2 minutes.

One at a time, dip the apples and pears in the caramel, twirling and swirling them to coat completely.  Dip the tops in the granola to coat them, then transfer to the cooling rack or the parchment paper to cool.  As the apples and pears cool, the caramel will set.

Store the caramel apples and pears, wrapped in cellophane if desired, in a cool, dry place until ready to serve or up to 2 days.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             slices  lean bacon -- chopped fine
  1              pound  boneless pork loin -- cut 1" pieces
  1              pound  boneless lamb shoulder -- cut 1" pieces
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (28 oz), drained, chopped,
                        reserving 1/2 cup of the juice
  1                     duck - (4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
  3               cups  fine dry bread crumbs - (abt)
                        === BEAN MIXTURE ===
  2             quarts  chicken broth
  2             quarts  water
  2             pounds  dried white beans -- picked over,
                        soaked in water overnight, and drained
  1              piece  salt pork - (1/2 lb) -- simmered in water
                        to cover for 15 minutes and drained
  1              pound  smoked pork sausage, such as kielbasa -- in 1" pieces
  3                     onions -- halved lengthwise
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed lightly
                        and left whole
  1           teaspoon  crumbled dried thyme
                        === BOQUET GARNI ===
  4                     parsley sprigs -- plus
  3                     celery tops -- plus
  1                     leek, white and pale green part -- plus
  2                     bay leaves -- tied together in
                        a cheesecloth bag

Make the bean mixture:  In a large heavy kettle combine the broth and the water and bring the liquid to a boil.  Stir in the beans, the salt pork, and the sausage and bring the liquid to a boil, skimming the froth.  Stir in the onions, the garlic, the thyme, the bouquet garni, and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours, or until the beans are tender.

Discard the salt pork, the onions, and the bouquet garni, strain the mixture through a colander set over a large bowl, and in separate bowls reserve the bean mixture and the broth.  The bean mixture and the broth may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.

In a large skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it is crisp and transfer it with tongs to paper towels to drain.  In the fat remaining in the skillet brown the pork and the lamb over moderately-high heat, turning the pieces once, for 8 minutes and transfer the meat with a slotted spoon to a large casserole.

In the fat remaining in the skillet cook the onion, the celery, and the garlic with salt and pepper to taste over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened.  Stir in the wine and boil the mixture until the liquid is reduced by half.  Stir in the tomatoes with the reserved juice and the bacon and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to the casserole and braise it, covered, in a preheated 325 degree oven for 1 hour.

Arrange the duck pieces, skin-sides down, on a rack in a roasting pan and broil them under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 10 minutes.  Turn the duck pieces and broil them for 10 minutes more, or until the juices run clear and the meat is cooked through.  Transfer the duck with tongs to a cutting board and reserve 1/4 cup of duck fat.

In a 6-quart casserole layer 1/3 of the reserved bean mixture, 1/2 the braised meat mixture, 4 pieces of duck, 1/2 remaining bean mixture, the remaining braised meat mixture, the remaining duck pieces, and the remaining bean mixture.  Pour 6 cups of the reserved broth, skimmed of any fat, slowly over the mixture, sprinkle the top with 2 cups of the bread crumbs, and drizzle it with 2 tablespoons of the reserved duck fat.

Bake the cassoulet, uncovered, in the middle of a 325 degree preheated oven for 30 minutes.  Press the crumb layer lightly into the cassoulet, top it with the remaining 1 cup crumbs, and drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons duck fat.  Bake the cassoulet for 1 3/4 hours more, until the crust is golden brown.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

       Cedar-Planked Salmon With Maple Glaze And Mustard Mashed Pot

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated peeled fresh gingerroot
  4        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                     untreated cedar plank - (17" by 10 1/2") -- if desired
  2 1/2         pounds  center-cut salmon fillet with skin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Greens from 1 bunch scallions
                        === MUSTARD MASHED POTATOES ===
  3             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  whole-grain or coarse-grain mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small heavy saucepan simmer maple syrup, gingerroot, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste until reduced to about 1 cup, about 30 minutes, and let cool.  (Maple glaze may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring maple glaze to room temperature before proceeding.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  If using cedar plank, lightly oil and heat in middle of oven 15 minutes; or lightly oil a shallow baking pan large enough to hold salmon.

Arrange scallion greens in one layer on plank or in baking pan to form a bed for fish.

In another small saucepan heat half of glaze over low heat until heated through to use as a sauce.  Stir in remaining tablespoon lemon juice.  Remove pan from heat and keep sauce warm, covered.

Put salmon, skin-side down, on scallion greens and brush with remaining glaze.  Season salmon with salt and pepper and roast in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 20 minutes if using baking pan or about 35 if using plank.

Cut salmon crosswise into 6 pieces.  On each of 6 plates arrange salmon and scallion greens on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Drizzle salmon with warm sauce.

Mustard Mashed Potatoes:  In a 5-quart kettle cover potatoes with cold salted water by 2 inches and simmer until tender, 35 to 45 minutes.  While potatoes are simmering, in a small saucepan heat milk with butter over moderate heat until butter is melted.  Remove pan from heat and keep milk mixture warm, covered.

In a colander drain potatoes and cool just until they can be handled.  Peel potatoes, transferring to a large bowl.  Add mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and three fourths hot milk mixture and with a potato masher mash potatoes until smooth, adding more milk mixture if necessary to make them creamy.  (Potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled in a buttered ovenproof dish, covered.  Bring potatoes to room temperature before reheating, covered.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a small heavy saucepan simmer maple syrup, gingerroot, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste until reduced to about 1 cup, about 30 minutes, and let cool.  (Maple glaze may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring maple glaze to room temperature before proceeding.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  If using cedar plank, lightly oil and heat in middle of oven 15 minutes; or lightly oil a shallow baking pan large enough to hold salmon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange scallion greens in one layer on plank or in baking pan to form a bed for fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another small saucepan heat half of glaze over low heat until heated through to use as a sauce.  Stir in remaining tablespoon lemon juice.  Remove pan from heat and keep sauce warm, covered.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put salmon, skin-side down, on scallion greens and brush with remaining glaze.  Season salmon with salt and pepper and roast in middle of oven until just cooked through, about 20 minutes if using baking pan or about 35 if using plank.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut salmon crosswise into 6 pieces.  On each of 6 plates arrange salmon and scallion greens on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Drizzle salmon with warm sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mustard Mashed Potatoes:  In a 5-quart kettle cover potatoes with cold salted water by 2 inches and simmer until tender, 35 to 45 minutes.  While potatoes are simmering, in a small saucepan heat milk with butter over moderate heat until butter is melted.  Remove pan from heat and keep milk mixture warm, covered.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a colander drain potatoes and cool just until they can be handled.  Peel potatoes, transferring to a large bowl.  Add mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and three fourths hot milk mixture and with a potato masher mash potatoes until smooth, adding more milk mixture if necessary to make them creamy.  (Potatoes may be made 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled in a buttered ovenproof dish, covered.  Bring potatoes to room temperature before reheating, covered.)

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Darjeeling tea leaves
  12                    extra large egg yolks -- beaten
  1                cup  brown sugar
  4               cups  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  Chai Spice Powder -- see below
  1                cup  light brown sugar
                        === CHAI SPICE POWDER ===
  1           teaspoon  cardamom
  1                     cinnamon stick
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  whole cloves

Steep 1 cup Darjeeling tea leaves in 4 cups boiling water for 7 minutes.  Strain tea leaves and reduce to 3/4 cup.  Grind spice to powder.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In a large heat-proof mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.  Place the cream in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Warm just until bubbles form around the edge.  Remove from heat and, whisking constantly, pour into the egg and sugar mixture.  Add the spice powder and the reduced tea liquid.  Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined.

Pour the mixture through a very fine sieve into 6 crËme brulee dishes, filling them only half full.  Place the dishes into a shallow baking dish large to hold them without crowding.  Place the dish on the middle oven rack.  Working quickly to preserve the heat, finish filling the dishes with the custard mixture, making sure that it comes right to the top of each dish.  Then carefully fill the baking dish with very hot tap water so it comes halfway up the sides of the filled dishes.  Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the custard is set in the center.  Remove the custards to a wire rack to cool.  Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until ready to use.

When ready to serve, preheat the broiler.  Pass the brown sugar through a fine sieve to eliminate all lumps.  Generously sprinkle the top of each chilled custard with an equal portion of the brown sugar, taking care to cover all of the custard, so that it gives an even finish.  Place the chilled crËme brulee dishes under the preheated broiler and broil for about 2 minutes, or until the tops are crackling brown.  Remove from the broiler and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TORTILLA STRIPS ===
  3               cups  vegetable oil
  2           packages  corn tortillas - (8 oz ea) -- cut 1/2"-wide strips
                        === CHILAQUILES ===
  1              large  onion chopped
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1 1/4         pounds  cooked turkey meat -- shredded
  3               cups  Roasted Tomatillo Salsa -- (see below)
  6             ounces  Monterey Jack -- shredded
     1/4           cup  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  milk
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro sprigs
  3             ounces  queso fresco or feta -- crumbled
                        === ROASTED TOMATILLO SALSA ===
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh tomatillos
                        (or 3 (11-oz) cans tomatillos)
  5                     fresh serrano chiles
  3                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro
  1              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  coarse salt

Heat oil in a 3 1/2-quart flameproof nonreactive shallow casserole or deep skillet to 375 degrees.  Fry tortillas in batches, turning occasionally, until golden, about 1 minute, and transfer to paper towels to drain (return oil to 375 degrees between batches).  Carefully pour off all but 1 tablespoon hot oil into a large metal bowl to cool before discarding.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Cook onion in oil in casserole over moderately-high heat, stirring, until softened.  Add broth and turkey and simmer, uncovered, stirring, until liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes.  Add 2 1/2 cups salsa and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and toss with Monterey Jack and tortilla strips.

Bake chilaquiles, uncovered, in middle of oven until bubbling, about 15 minutes.  Whisk together crËme fraÓche and milk.  Serve chilaquiles topped with crËme fraÓche, cilantro, and cheese.

Roasted Tomatillo Salsa:  Preheat broiler.  If using fresh tomatillos, remove husks and rinse under warm water to remove stickiness.  If using canned tomatillos, drain and measure out 2 cups.  Broil chiles, garlic, and fresh tomatillos (do not broil canned) on rack of a broiler pan 1 to 2 inches from heat, turning once, until tomatillos are softened and slightly charred, about 7 minutes.

Peel garlic and pull off tops of chiles.  PurÈe all ingredients in a blender.  (Makes 3 cups)

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cupcakes                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch-proces
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                     egg
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        === FOR THE ICING ===
  2                     egg whites
  2 1/2           cups  confectionersí sugar - (to 3 cups)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
                        Black or dark brown food coloring

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 12 muffin-tin wells or line them with paper muffin cups.

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; reserve.

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat well.  Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternately with buttermilk.

Spoon into the prepared muffin tins, filling each cup about 2/3 full.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 16 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven, let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack and let cool to room temperature.

To make the icing, place the egg whites in a bowl.  Using an electric mixer set on high speed, beat until soft peaks form.  Add the confectionersí sugar, vanilla, and orange juice and continue to beat until thick and shiny.  If too thick, add more orange juice.  If too thin, add more confectionersí sugar.

Transfer 1/3 of the icing to a small bowl and color with black or dark brown food coloring.  Spoon this dark icing into a pastry bag fitted with a tip, or pour it into a plastic squeeze bottle.

Now, ice the cupcakes and make the cobwebs:  Spoon the white icing into the center of the cupcake and spread with a small spatula or butter knife.  Starting at the center of a cupcake, pipe a spiral of the dark icing from the center to the outer edge.  Then, drag a sharp knife point from the center of the spiral to the edge of the cupcake.  Wipe the knife clean, move about a 1/2-inch to the left or right and drag the knife in the opposite direction from the outer edge to the middle of the cupcake.  Continue in this way until you have worked your way around the cupcake and formed the cobweb.  Repeat with the remaining cupcakes.

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 12 muffin-tin wells or line them with paper muffin cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat well.  Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternately with buttermilk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon into the prepared muffin tins, filling each cup about 2/3 full.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 16 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven, let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack and let cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the icing, place the egg whites in a bowl.  Using an electric mixer set on high speed, beat until soft peaks form.  Add the confectionersí sugar, vanilla, and orange juice and continue to beat until thick and shiny.  If too thick, add more orange juice.  If too thin, add more confectionersí sugar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer 1/3 of the icing to a small bowl and color with black or dark brown food coloring.  Spoon this dark icing into a pastry bag fitted with a tip, or pour it into a plastic squeeze bottle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Now, ice the cupcakes and make the cobwebs:  Spoon the white icing into the center of the cupcake and spread with a small spatula or butter knife.  Starting at the center of a cupcake, pipe a spiral of the dark icing from the center to the outer edge.  Then, drag a sharp knife point from the center of the spiral to the edge of the cupcake.  Wipe the knife clean, move about a 1/2-inch to the left or right and drag the knife in the opposite direction from the outer edge to the middle of the cupcake.  Continue in this way until you have worked your way around the cupcake and formed the cobweb.  Repeat with the remaining cupcakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  jumbo crabmeat -- picked over
                        to remove cartilage
  1                     fresh cayenne chile
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- blanched, minced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  Garam Masala
  2        tablespoons  fresh ginger juice
  1           teaspoon  saffron powder
  4               cups  heavy cream
                        Coarse salt -- to taste

Set aside 1/4 cup of the crabmeat for a garnish.  Wash the chile and remove the stem.  Cut the chile in half crosswise and mince the top half only.  Reserve the bottom for another use.

Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Add the garlic, onion, and minced chile.  Saute for about 3 minutes or just until vegetables begin to brown slightly.  Stir in the garam masala.  When well combined, add the ginger juice.  Stir well again.

Add the larger portion of the crabmeat and bring to a simmer again.  Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring gently from time to time.  Stir in the saffron and simmer for an additional minute.

Add the cream and bring to a simmer again.  Lower the heat and allow the soup to just barely simmer for about 15 minutes, or until it is slightly reduced.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, if necessary.

Pour an equal portion into 6 shallow soup bowls.  Garnish the center of each serving with some of the reserved crabmeat and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

            Cranberry-Ricotta Tarts In A Toasted Almond Crust

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Laura Werlin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  almonds -- lightly toasted
  6        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === CRANBERRIES ===
     1/2           cup  apple brandy, such as Calvados -- (or use water)
     2/3           cup  dried cranberries
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  fresh whole milk ricotta -- drained if necessary
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

In a food processor, combine the almonds and brown sugar and grind until the almonds are finely chopped.  Add the melted butter and pulse on and off, just until the butter is incorporated into the mixture.  Place 6 (4-inch) tart pans with removable bottoms on a baking sheet.  (Or you can use a 10-inch pan with removable bottom.)  Divide the almond mixture evenly among the tart pans, pressing the crust firmly against the sides and bottoms.  Set aside.

Cranberries:  In a small saute pan, slowly heat the brandy, and pour it over the cranberries in a heatproof bowl.  (Caution: Do not heat alcohol over a high heat or it will ignite.  If this happens, simply let it burn away, making sure that there is nothing flammable near the stove.  It will burn away in a matter of seconds.)  Let the cranberries sit for 20 minutes and then drain.

Filling:  In a medium-size bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and stir vigorously until the mixture is very creamy.

To Assemble:  Place the tart pans on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle the cranberries into the crust.  Carefully pour the cheese mixture just until it reaches the top of the crust.  Bake the tarts in a preheated 325 degree oven for 45 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown.

Let them cool completely before serving.  As the tarts cool, the filling will fall and shrivel slightly.  Nonetheless, they will still look irresistible.  Remove tarts from pans just before serving.

Comments:  Sometimes fresh ricotta has a large amount of liquid, which can interfere with the baking process and create a runny tart.  If your ricotta seems watery, place it in a colander lined with a double layer of cheesecloth, and let it drain for about 1 hour.  If you do not have cheesecloth, use a thin paper towel or a coffee filter.

This recipe yields 6 (4-inch) tarts.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Cranberries:  In a small saute pan, slowly heat the brandy, and pour it over the cranberries in a heatproof bowl.  (Caution: Do not heat alcohol over a high heat or it will ignite.  If this happens, simply let it burn away, making sure that there is nothing flammable near the stove.  It will burn away in a matter of seconds.)  Let the cranberries sit for 20 minutes and then drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Filling:  In a medium-size bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and stir vigorously until the mixture is very creamy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Assemble:  Place the tart pans on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle the cranberries into the crust.  Carefully pour the cheese mixture just until it reaches the top of the crust.  Bake the tarts in a preheated 325 degree oven for 45 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let them cool completely before serving.  As the tarts cool, the filling will fall and shrivel slightly.  Nonetheless, they will still look irresistible.  Remove tarts from pans just before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Sometimes fresh ricotta has a large amount of liquid, which can interfere with the baking process and create a runny tart.  If your ricotta seems watery, place it in a colander lined with a double layer of cheesecloth, and let it drain for about 1 hour.  If you do not have cheesecloth, use a thin paper towel or a coffee filter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 (4-inch) tarts.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Laura Werlin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  celery roots - (abt 1 lb ea)
  2                     fennel bulbs - (abt 1/2 lb ea)
  2                     Granny Smith or other tart firm apples -- peeled, cored
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper --to taste
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream - (abt)
  8             ounces  Colby-style cheese, such as Orb Weaver -- coarsely grated
                        (or use aged, but not sharp, cheddar)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 2-quart gratin dish or other ovenproof casserole.

Cut off the entire rough exterior of the celery roots, making sure that all brown parts are removed.  You will be removing about 1/4- to 1/2-inch of the exterior of each.  Next, cut each celery root in half lengthwise.  Turn each half cut-side down, and cut into 1/4-inch wide pieces.  Repeat with the remaining celery root.  Set aside.

Cut off the fronds and the dark green parts of each fennel bulb, leaving just the bulb.  Cut each bulb in half lengthwise.  Cut each half lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices.

In a vegetable steamer, combine the celery root and fennel and steam for 5 minutes.  Remove from the steamer and set aside to cool slightly.

Cut the apples into 1/4-inch-thick rings.

Place 1/3 of the celery root on the bottom of the prepared dish.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Overlap with 1/3 of the apple slices, and sprinkle with a little more salt but no pepper.  Put 1/3 of the fennel over the apples, and once again sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Repeat with the remaining celery root, apple, and fennel.

Pour cream around the sides of the dish until the cream reaches about halfway up the dish.  Sprinkle the top of the gratin with the cheese.  Cover and bake for 35 minutes, or until the vegetables and apple feel tender when pierced with a fork or a skewer.  Turn the oven to broil, remove the cover, and broil until the gratin is golden brown and bubbling, about 3 minutes.

Let cool 15 minutes to allow the cream to firm up slightly and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  bacon drippings
  6                     eggs
  12            slices  bread
                        Waxed paper

Heat the drippings in a wide flat-bottomed skillet until they spit and smoke.  Break in the eggs.  They will immediately bubble around the edges, making then crisp.  Break their yolks with a fork and swirl them around, so that they are scattered fairly evenly through the whites.  This will cook very quickly and the eggs should be tough.

Either push them to one side of the pan or remove them, and fry bread in the drippings for each sandwich, two slices an egg.  Fry on one side only.  Sandwich egg between bread slices.  Wrap them in waxed paper.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

Heat the drippings in a wide flat-bottomed skillet until they spit and smoke.  Break in the eggs.  They will immediately bubble around the edges, making then crisp.  Break their yolks with a fork and swirl them around, so that they are scattered fairly evenly through the whites.  This will cook very quickly and the eggs should be tough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Either push them to one side of the pan or remove them, and fry bread in the drippings for each sandwich, two slices an egg.  Fry on one side only.  Sandwich egg between bread slices.  Wrap them in waxed paper.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

  3             ounces  Laura Chenel's Taupiniere goat cheese or
                        other such as St. Maure or Valencay -- cut into 6 slices
  3             ounces  Laura Chenel's Chabis goat cheese or
                        other such as Montrachet or Chevrion -- cut into 6 slices
  3             ounces  Laura Chenel's Capriccio goat cheese -- cut into 6 slices
  6             slices  whole-wheat walnut bread - (thin slices)
                        Chopped fresh chervil and chives -- for garnish
                        === FOR THE VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
                        === FOR THE WALNUTS ===
  2               cups  walnut halves
     3/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste

Make the vinaigrette:  In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, syrup and shallot, add the oils in a stream, whisking, and whisk the vinaigrette until it is emulsified.  Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper.

Make the candied walnuts:  In a saucepan simmer the walnuts in water to cover for 5 minutes, or until they are softened slightly, drain them, and transfer them to a paper towel to dry completely.  In a bowl stir together the walnuts and the sugar.

In a Dutch oven heat 3 inches of the oil to 350 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer and in it fry the walnuts in batches for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are brown and crisp.  Transfer the walnuts as they are fried with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet and season them with the salt and cayenne.

In a large bowl, toss the frisee with the dates and enough of the vinaigrette to just coat the salad, rserving any remaining vinaigrette for another use.  Divide the salad among 6 plates, mounding it in the center, divide the cheeses and the bread around it, and sprinkle the salads with the walnuts and the herbs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper --to taste
     1/4           cup  dried apricots - (abt 2 oz) -- plumped in hot water
                        drained, and cut into 1/4" pieces
     1/2           cup  fresh goat cheese - (2 to 3 oz) -- or use fromage
                        blanc or softened cream cheese
  2              whole  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- each halved
                        lengthwise
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  Japanese panko crumbs or use
                        toasted coarse bread crumbs
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  white wine
     1/2           cup  unsalted chicken stock
                        Whole fresh sage leaves -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a medium-size saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes.  Turn the heat down to medium and add the garlic.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Donít let the onions and garlic brown.  Next, add the chopped sage and salt and pepper to taste, and cook until the onions are translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.

Add the apricots and cook until heated through, 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes.  Thoroughly mix in the goat cheese and set aside.  (This can be made up to 24 hours in advance and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before stuffing the chicken breasts.)

Place each chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  With a kitchen mallet, a cleaver, or a heavy tin can, such as a can of tomatoes, pound the breasts until they are between 1/8- and 1/4-inch thick.  (They will not roll easily if they are too thick.)  Season with salt and pepper.

Spread about 1/4 cup of the stuffing down the center of each chicken breast.  Fold up the short ends of the chicken breast, and then roll one long side jelly-roll-fashion to the other side.  Tie the ends with string to secure them.

Place the egg in a shallow bowl and the panko crumbs in another shallow bowl.  Dip the chicken in the egg, and then roll in the panko crumbs until completely coated.

In an ovenproof saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Place the chicken in the pan and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes.  Then put the pan in the oven and bake until the chicken is a deep golden color and firm when pressed, 10 to 12 minutes.

After the chicken breasts come out of the oven, remove the strings and put them on a warmed platter; tent with foil.  Next, place the pan over high heat and deglaze it with the wine.  Boil until reduced to about 1 tablespoon, 1 to 2 minutes, and then add the chicken stock.  Boil until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes, and add salt and pepper to taste.  Remove from the heat and swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter.

Cut each breast in half crosswise and place one half on its side on the plate.  Lean the second half against the first, facing down.  Alternatively, slice breast into even slices.  Drizzle with the sauce, garnish with sage leaves, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    quail eggs
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  Sherry vinegar
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  corn or canola oil
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly- ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled
                        Boston lettuce leaves
  1              bunch  watercress -- coarse stems removed
  4             ounces  white mushrooms - (abt 6 med) -- sliced
  4                     semi-boneless jumbo quail - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- rib cage and

Arrange quail on top of salad and sprinkle with tarragon.  Serve remaining vinaigrette on the side.

During the last minutes of cooking, top each burger with 2 slices of cheese, cover the grill, and let the cheese melt, about 1 minute.  Split the buns and toast on the grill, cut-side down, until golden.

Place a burger on each bun and top with lettuce, onions, tomato, and a dollop of Horseradish Mustard.  Arrange on a large platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  marshmallows - (to 8)
  5        tablespoons  unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  4               cups  milk
  1                cup  half-and-half

Place 1 marshmallow horizontally on a work surface.  Using a rolling pin or soup can, flatten the marshmallow by rolling back and forth over it.  Using Halloween-themed mini cookie cutters, cut into desired shapes.

In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the cocoa, sugar, and water.  Bring slowly to a boil, stirring, until the sugar and cocoa dissolve, about 2 minutes.  Add the milk and the half-and-half and continue to cook, stirring, until bubbles appear along the edges of the pan, about 5 minutes; do not allow to boil.

Pour into mugs and garnish with the marshmallow spooks.  Serve immediately while the spooks hold their shapes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     egg yolk -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  unsweetened Fresh Pumpkin Puree -- (see recipe)

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt; reserve.

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg yolk and vanilla and beat well.  Beat in the Fresh Pumpkin Puree.  Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing well after each addition.

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, divide in half, flatten each half into a disk, wrap separately in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 of the disks 1/8-inch thick.  Using a pumpkin-shaped cookie cutter or cardboard Jack-oí-lantern template 5 to 6 inches in diameter, cut out cookies.  If using the cookie cutter, finish off the Jack-oí-lantern by cutting out eyes and a mouth with the tip of a sharp knife.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

Transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets.  Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.  Decorate with colored sugars/chocolates.

This recipe yields 4 dozen 3-inch cookies.

  2         tablespoon  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
     1/4      teaspoon  ground hot red pepper

  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              small  yellow onion -- peeled, chopped
     1/2        medium  green bell peeper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped roasted green chilies
  6             ounces  mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and finely chopped
     1/2           cup  canned crushed tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  minced pimiento
                        === TORTILAS ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  8                     corn tortillas
                        === CHICKEN AND OTHER LAYERS ===
  3               cups  diced cooked chicken
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-shredded mild cheddar cheese
     1/4           cup  sliced pimiento-stuffed olives
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced scallions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat 11- by 7- by 2-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

Sauce:  Melt butter in medium heavy skillet over moderate heat.  Add garlic, red pepper, and cumin and stir-fry 1 minute.  Blend in flour, add broth and milk, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth -- about 3 minutes.  Stir in sour cream, salt, and black pepper to taste; set aside.

Filling:  Melt butter in large heavy skillet, over moderate heat.  Add onion, green pepper, green chilies, mushrooms, tomatoes, and pimiento, and cook, stirring often, until vegetables soften and flavors meld -- 10 to 15 minutes.

Tortillas:  Pour oil to depth of 1/2 inch in small heavy skillet, set over moderate heat, and heat until ripples appear on skillet bottom.  Holding tortillas by tongs, dip one by one into oil just long enough to soften, 5 to 10 seconds.  Drain on paper towels.

To Layer:  Arrange half of tortillas in bottom of prepared baking dish, then build up layers this way, distributing each evenly: 1/2 chicken and 1/3 sauce; 1/2 each filling, cheese, olives, and scallions, and 1/2 remaining tortillas, chicken, filling, cheese, olives, scallions, and finally, remaining sauce.  Bake, uncovered, until bubbly -- about 30 to 35 minutes.  Serve at once.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dried green or brown lentils -- picked over,
                        and rinsed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  5              large  Swiss chard leaves -- washed well, stems
                        removed, sliced thin strips crosswise
  2        tablespoons  mashed garlic
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped cilantro
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook the lentils until tender, 20 to 45 minutes.  Check often because the cooking time varies depending on the age of the lentils.  Drain and set aside.

In a medium-size non-reactive skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat, then cook the Swiss chard until it wilts, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove and drain off any liquid.  Set aside.

In the same skillet heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cilantro and cook until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the Swiss chard, drained lentils and water and cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add the lemon juice and pomegranate molasses and continue cooking until the lentils look mushy, about another 10 minutes.  Transfer to a serving bowl and drizzle a small amount of olive oil over it before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  plum tomatoes
  3              dozen  littleneck clams -- scrubbed well
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2         pound  linguine
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- chopped

In a saucepan of boiling water blanch tomatoes, 2 or 3 at a time, 10 seconds and transfer to a bowl of ice and cold water.  Peel, seed, and dice tomatoes.

In a large heavy kettle steam clams in water, covered, over moderately-high heat 5 to 10 minutes, checking after 5 minutes and transferring them as they open to a bowl.  (Discard any clams that are unopened after 10 minutes.)  Remove kettle from heat.  Strain liquid into a small bowl leaving any sand particles behind.

Into reserved clam liquid stir chopped clams, tomatoes, garlic, oil, and red pepper flakes and simmer 2 minutes.  Add linguine, basil, remaining 12 clams in their shells, and any liquid in bowl and toss well with salt and pepper to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     Chinese dried mushrooms
  1              bunch  Chinese long beans - (abt 12 oz)
  2             ounces  Sichuan preserved vegetable
     1/2                Chinese sausage (lop chong)
  2             ounces  pork butt
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  thin soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Shao Hsing rice cooking wine
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  sugar
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced scallions
     1/4           cup  cilantro sprigs

In a medium bowl, soak the mushrooms in 1/2 cup cold water for 30 minutes or until softened.  Drain and squeeze dry (reserve the soaking liquid for use in soups).  Cut off and discard the stems and mince the caps.

Wash the long beans in several changes of cold water and drain thoroughly in a colander until dry to the touch.  Cut into 1/4-inch-long pieces to make about 3 cups.

Rinse the preserved vegetable in cold water until the red chili-paste coating is removed and pat dry.  Finely chop to make about 1/3 cup.

Chop the Chinese sausage into 1/4-inch pieces.  Dice the pork into 1/4-inch-pieces and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Stir to combine and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon salt; set aside.

Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sausage and pork and stir-fry 1 minute.  Transfer to a plate.  Add the 1 tablespoon oil and mushrooms to the wok and stir-fry 1 minute.  Add the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon sugar and stir-fry another minute.  Remove the mushrooms from the wok and add to the sausage mixture.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and the green beans to the wok and stir-fry 1 minute.  Cover for 20 seconds.  Uncover, add 2 tablespoons water and stir-fry 10 seconds.  Cover and cook 30 seconds.

Return the sausage mixture and the preserved vegetable to the wok along with the scallions, cilantro sprigs and soy sauce mixture.  Stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes or until the vegetables are just tender.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             medium  new potatoes
                        Water -- as needed
  1 3/4         pounds  fresh spinach, or 3 (10-oz) pkgs frozen
                        chopped spinach, thawed reserving liquid
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1                cup  cooking liquid from potatoes and spinach
                        Sour cream or ketchup -- (optional), garnish
                        White bread -- for croutons

Toast bread in a toaster.  With a star-shaped cookie cutter, cut out star shapes from the toast.

Peel and cut each potato into 1-inch chunks.  Place potatoes in a 3-quart pot and cover with water.  Cook over medium-high heat until the potatoes are almost done, adding spinach (and spinach liquid if using frozen) the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking time.  Remove pan from heat and drain, reserving cooking liquid.

Puree in batches in a blender (make sure each batch has some spinach, potatoes, and enough milk and cooking liquid to blend).  Pour batches into a large pot or bowl.  When finished, mix well and add salt and pepper to taste.  Add more liquid if you would like a thinner soup.

Serve with sour cream or ketchup swirled into the soup with a spoon and star croutons.

This recipe yields 10 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  black truffle paste in oil
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper --to taste
                        === FOR THE CROSTINI ===
  1                     regular or sourdough baguette -- about 3" dia,
                        cut into 32 (1/4") thick slices
  2        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 3 tbspns) -- for brushing bread
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  3                     portobello mushrooms (abt 3/4 lb total) -- stems removed, caps
                        sliced 1/4" thk, then quartered crosswise
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed, caps
                        sliced 1/4" thk, then cut thirds crosswise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper --to taste
                        3 ounces             Camembert cheese -- such as Old Chathamí
                        Hudson Valley Camembert -- at room temperature
                        (or Brie or other soft-ripened cheese)
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  3                     butter lettuce heads -- washed, and
                        torn into large pieces
  4                     hard-boiled eggs -- finely grated or
                        pressed through a sieve
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

To make the dressing:  In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, truffle paste, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.

To make the crostini:  Preheat the broiler.

Brush the cut sides of the baguette slices with olive oil, and place under the broiler just until the bread is toasted on both sides.  Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they are tender and the juices, if any, have cooked away.  (Wild mushrooms release almost no juices.)  If the mushrooms seem dry, add a few drops of chicken stock or water and continue to cook until theyíre nice and tender and any remaining liquid has boiled away.  (You want the mushrooms to be dry, almost crisp on the outside.)  Add salt and a generous amount of pepper, and set aside.

Spread or spoon about 1 1/2 teaspoons Camembert on each slice of the toast.  Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted (or maybe even dissapeared).

To assemble:  Reheat the mushrooms if they have cooled, or, if you prefer, keep them at room temperature.

For the salad:  Toss the lettuce and eggs with the dressing.  Distribute on individual salad plates.  Place 4 crostini on each plate, and top each one with about 1 tablespoon of the mushrooms.  Sprinkle with a little parsley, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

To make the dressing:  In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, truffle paste, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the crostini:  Preheat the broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the cut sides of the baguette slices with olive oil, and place under the broiler just until the bread is toasted on both sides.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they are tender and the juices, if any, have cooked away.  (Wild mushrooms release almost no juices.)  If the mushrooms seem dry, add a few drops of chicken stock or water and continue to cook until theyíre nice and tender and any remaining liquid has boiled away.  (You want the mushrooms to be dry, almost crisp on the outside.)  Add salt and a generous amount of pepper, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread or spoon about 1 1/2 teaspoons Camembert on each slice of the toast.  Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted (or maybe even dissapeared).
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble:  Reheat the mushrooms if they have cooled, or, if you prefer, keep them at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the salad:  Toss the lettuce and eggs with the dressing.  Distribute on individual salad plates.  Place 4 crostini on each plate, and top each one with about 1 tablespoon of the mushrooms.  Sprinkle with a little parsley, and serve.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     corned beef brisket - (4 to 5 lbs)
  4             quarts  chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  pickling spices
  1                     garlic head -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  12             small  new potatoes -- peeled
  6                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  6              small  turnips -- diced
  8              small  beets -- with tops
                        Hot mustard -- (optional)
                        Prepared horseradish -- (optional)

Place the corned beef and broth in a Dutch oven.  Add the pickling spices and garlic and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the beef is cooked, about 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

Add the potatoes, carrots and turnips to the pot and cook until the meat and vegetables are tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, cook the beets in a separate saucepan of boiling, salted water for 30 to 45 minutes (this prevents the beets from discoloring the other vegetables).

Remove the beef and all of the vegetables from their broth and arrange on a heated serving platter.  Pass the mustard and horseradish, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           packages  dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  1              pinch  sugar -- for the yeast
  8        tablespoons  butter
  1 3/4           cups  raisins
  4               cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  3             medium  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, and
                        cut into small slivers
  1                cup  whole almonds without brown skins
                        Oil -- for deep-frying

Sprinkle the yeast in the water in a small bowl and sprinkle with the sugar.  Let it stand for a moment, then stir to dissolve the yeast.  Set aside in a warm place.

In the meantime melt the butter and cool.  Place the raisins in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil.  Allow them to boil for a minute and then turn off the heat.  Let them stand for 5 minutes and drain.  Pat them dry with paper towels and mix them with 1 tablespoon of flour.

Place the rest of the flour in a large bowl, stir in the salt, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast.  Stir from the middle and slowly add the melted butter and the milk.  The dough should be very thick and hard to stir.  Then add raisins, apples, and almonds and combine thoroughly.  Allow this batter to rise for about 1 hour.  When doubled in bulk, stir down the dough.

Heat the oil to 350 degrees.  Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of dough and push it off the spoon with the aid of another spoon and let it (carefully) drop into the hot oil.  They should be at least 2-inches in diameter.  Fry the olie-koecken for about 5 minutes on each side.  Drain on paper towels.

The original recipe does not tell us to sprinkle or roll them in the sugar.  They are very good plain, but if you prefer you can dust them with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields about 30.

                        and tied securely with kitchen string
                        to keep the meat attached to the bone
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging shanks
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus additional,
                        if necessary
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus additional,
                        if necessary
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onion
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped carrots
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3               cups  chicken broth or beef broth - (to 4 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped peeled seeded tomato
                        (or 1 1/2 cups chopped drained canned plum
  6                     fresh parsley sprigs -- tied together with
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs -- and also with
  1                     bay leaf -- in cheesecloth
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE GREMOLATA ===
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves -- (preferably
                        flat-leafed)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic

Season the veal shanks with salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour, shaking off the excess.  In a heavy skillet heat 3 tablespoons of the butter and 3 tablespoons of the oil over moderately-high heat until the foam subsides.

In the fat, brown the veal shanks in batches, adding some of the additional butter and oil as necessary and transferring the shanks as they are browned to a platter.  Add the wine to the skillet, boil the mixture, scraping up the brown bits clinging to the bottom and sides of the skillet, until the liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, and reserve the wine mixture in a small bowl.

In a flameproof casserole just large enough to hold the veal shanks in one layer cook the onion, the carrots, the celery, and the garlic in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened.  Add the shanks with any juices that have accumulated on the platter, the reserved wine mixture, and enough of the broth to almost cover the shanks.  Spread the tomatoes over the shanks, add the cheesecloth bag, salt and pepper to taste, and bring the liquid to a simmer over moderately-high heat.  Braise the mixture, covered, in the middle of a preheated 325 degree oven for 2 hours, or until the veal is tender.

Transfer the shanks with a slotted spoon to an ovenproof serving dish, discard the strings, and keep the shanks warm.  Strain the pan juices into a saucepan, pressing hard on the solids, and skim the fat.  Boil the juices for 10 minutes, or until they are reduced to about 3 cups, baste the shanks with some of the reduced juices, and bake them, basting them 3 or 4 times with some of the remaining juices, for 10 minutes more, or until they are glazed.

Make the gremolata while the veal is baking:  In a bowl stir together the parsley, the zest, and the garlic.  Sprinkle the veal shanks with the gremolata, pour some of the juices around them, and serve the remaining juices separately.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  2               cups  warm water -- (abt 110 degrees)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
                        (or 1 tspn dried rosemary)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  coarsely-shredded raw potato
  1                cup  finely-shredded or grated Parmesan cheese
  6               cups  unbleached flour - (to 7 cups)
                        Additional olive oil

In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften.  Add salt, garlic, rosemary, olive oil, potato, cheese, and 3 cups flour.  Beat vigorously for 2 minutes.  Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.

Turn dough onto a floured work surface.  Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough.  Place dough into an oiled bowl.  Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil.  Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Turn dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half.  Shape each half into a ball and place onto a well-greased baking sheet.  Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place a shallow pan on the bottom shelf of the oven.  Just before baking, brush each loaf liberally with extra olive oil and cut a cross about 1/4-inch deep into the top.

Place the bread in the oven and put 5 ice cubes into the pan on the bottom shelf.  Close the door quickly to prevent steam from escaping.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaves reaches 190 degrees.  Immediately remove bread from baking sheet and cool on a rack.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  boneless veal shoulder -- trimmed of fat,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  2              large  onions -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry red or white wine
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  3                     whole cloves
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2                     bay leaves
  2             pounds  ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1              pound  perciatelli
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- melted
  1                cup  freshly-grated kefalotyri cheese

In a medium-sized enamel cast-iron casserole, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, then brown the veal on all sides, about 6 minutes.  Add the onions, stir, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook until soft, about another 5 minutes.

Add the garlic and wine and season with salt and pepper.  Stir, then add the vinegar, cloves, cinnamon and bay leaves.  Stir again and add the tomatoes.

Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the veal is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.  The sauce should be thick; reduce it if it is not.  Remove and discard the bay leaves, cinnamon stick and cloves (if you can find them).

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, salt abundantly and add the pasta.  Drain when soft and pour into a deep serving bowl or platter.  Pour the melted butter over the pasta, sprinkle the cheese over and toss to evenly coat.  Ladle the veal sauce over the pasta and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  1              pinch  salt
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  11       tablespoons  cold butter (do not use margarine)
  2                     egg yolks -- lightly beaten
  10                    seckle pears to 12, or 6 to 7 bosc pears, 
                        then cut into 2 or 3 lengthwise slices
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  currants
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/3           cup  white sugar - (to 1/2 cup) -- depending on the
                        sweetness of the pears
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  sugar

Place the currants in a small saucepan.  Cover with water and bring to a boil.  Allow them to boil for a minute and turn off the heat.  Let them soak for about 5 minutes.  Drain thoroughly and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.   Combine flour, salt, and sugar, and cut in butter with a dough blender or 2 knives until it resembles a coarse meal.  You can also use a food processor.  Stir in egg yolks.  Knead this mixture until smooth.  This takes quite a bit of kneading (you might want to use 2 hands).  Press the dough out on the bottom and sides of an 8- or 9-inch springform pan.  Neatly finish the rim.

In a large bowl, gently combine the pear slices with the lemon juice, spices, sugar, and currants.  Carefully arrange the fruits in the crust.  Dot with butter, sprinkle with sugar.  Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden.  Cool and serve.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2               cups  heavy cream
  6              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
  36                    fresh raspberries
                        Sugar for glazing -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees and set a rack in the middle.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the melted butter.  Divide the mixture among 4 (1-cup) custard cups and press down to form a crust on the bottom.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream and 1 tablespoon of the remaining tablespoon of sugar.  Scald and remove from the heat.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the yolks, the remaining tablespoon of sugar, vanilla, and rum.  Whisk lightly, just to combine.

Whisking lightly, gradually drizzle the scalded cream mixture into the egg mixture to warm it without scrambling the eggs.  Strain the mixture and pour into custard cups.  Place 6 raspberries in each cup, dunking them so they are coated with custard.

Arrange the cups in a roasting pan and pour in hot water halfway up the sides.  Cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the custards are set.  Cool in the pan, then refrigerate, covered, up to 2 days ahead.

If you like, sprinkle a light layer of sugar over each custard and place under a preheated broiler for about 2 to 4 minutes, watching that they donít burn.  Serve immediately after glazing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  drippings, such as bacon
  2               cups  finely-ground white cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Put the drippings in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet.  Place the skillet in the oven and let the drippings heat while you prepare the batter.

In a big bowl, mix the cornmeal, salt, and baking soda.  Add the egg and buttermilk, and stir until just blended.  The drippings should be good and hot, but not smoking, by now.  Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and swirl gently to coat it with drippings.

Pour the rest of the drippings into the batter.  It should crackle and pop.  Mix quickly and lightly, just to blend, then pour the batter into the skillet and put it back in the oven.   Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the bread is set in the middle, the edges are browned, and the top crust is golden.

Serve hot, cut into wedges and lifted straight out of the skillet.  If you prefer, turn the skillet upside down and let the cornbread slip out on a big plate.  If your cast-iron is seasoned well, it will do so easily.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cans  black-eyed peas - (15 1/2 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
  3                     red bell peppers -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/4           cups  fresh bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2    tablespoons  coarse salt
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal -- plus additional
                        for dusting
  1                cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     cup mayonnaise

Mash half of peas in a bowl with a fork and stir in remaining peas.  Cook red peppers in butter in a large nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until barely softened.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute more.  Transfer 1/3 of pepper mixture to a bowl and cool.  Set aside for red pepper mayo.

Stir remaining pepper mixture into peas with bread crumbs, cilantro, eggs, cumin, and salt.  Scoop 1 tablespoon mixture into palm of your hand (mixture will be soft and moist) and form into a roughly 1-inch-wide patty.  Put it on a tray and form more patties in same manner, arranging in 1 layer on tray.  Dip patties, 1 at a time, into cornmeal, turning gently to coat, and transfer as coated to a tray lined with waxed paper and dusted with cornmeal.  Chill patties, covered, at least 2 hours and up to 8.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook cakes, 12 at a time, until golden, about 3 minutes on each side.  Put cakes as cooked in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan.  Between batches, carefully wipe skillet clean with paper towels and add more oil.

Stir mayonnaise into reserved red pepper mixture and season with salt and pepper.  Reheat cakes in middle of oven until hot, about 5 minutes, and top with red pepper mayo.

This recipe yields about 60 hors díoeuvres.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  ripe tomatoes -- cored, quartered
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely diced
  1                     garlic clove -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  honey

In a small bowl, toss the tomatoes in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and place on a baking sheet.  Roast until soft, 10 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor and process until smooth.  Strain, pressing against the solids with a wooden spoon to extract as much pulp and juice as possible.

Add the tomato puree, cider vinegar, brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and honey, and season with salt and pepper.  Continue cooking, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 20 minutes.  May be refrigerated, covered, up to 2 days.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  urad dal -- well washed, drained
                        Cold water -- to cover dal
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil - (approx)
  6             ounces  sevruga caviar or other fine caviar or oth
  18             small  chive points

Put the urad dal in a deep bowl with cold water to cover dal by about 3 inches.  Using the palms of your hands, rub the dal to split them apart.  Allow them to soak for at least 8 hours.  Drain well, reserving about half of the soaking water.

Place the dal and half of the water into a food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process until very thick and smooth, adding additional soaking water as necessary.  Add salt.

Pour 1 tablespoon of the oil in a nonstick griddle over medium heat, tilting the pan so the oil covers the entire bottom.  When hot, pour spoonfuls of dal batter onto the griddle to make round blinis 2 1/2 inches in diameter.  Do not crowd the pan.  Cook for about 1 minute, or until the batter is set and the bottom is lightly browned.

Turn the blinis and cook for an additional minute, or until they are cooked through.  Remove from the griddle, place on a warm plate, and loosely tent with foil to keep warm.  Continue to grease the griddle and cook the blinis until you have 18.

Place 3 blinis, slightly overlapping, on 6 small plates.  Place a spoonful of caviar in the center of each blini.  Place a chive point into each mound of caviar and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2             pounds  boneless lamb cut from the leg with
                        its fat into 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  high-quality full-fat plain yogurt

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large white shrimp - (16 to 20 size)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots or green onion
     1/2           cup  fruit vinegar, such as pear
  1                cup  rich chicken stock
     1/3           cup  heavy cream or crËme fraiche
     1/4           cup  diced fresh fruit such as pears or
                        whatever the vinegar is made of -- (optional)
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh herbs of choice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE BRINE ===
     1/3           cup  kosher salt
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
  1              quart  cold water
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh chervil or tarragon sprigs

Stir the brine ingredients together until salt and sugar are dissolved.  Peel and devein the shrimp (reserving the shells) and place in brine for 1 to 2 hours refrigerated.  Drain, rinse and set aside.

In a heavy sautÈ pan heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil over moderately-high heat.  Coarsely chop the reserved shells and add to the pan along with the shallots and stir until lightly colored.  Add the vinegar and stock and reduce over high heat until sauce thickens slightly, about 4 minutes.  Strain, pressing down on the solids and return to pan with the cream.  Reduce again to a light sauce consistency.  Stir in fruit, herbs and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside and keep warm (can be made ahead and gently reheated).

Wipe out pan, add remaining butter and oil and quickly sautÈ shrimp until pink and barely cooked through.  Arrange on warm plates, spoon warm sauce over and garnish with herb sprigs.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Tender Chicken On Rice

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Grace Young
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  Smithfield ham
  8                     Chinese dried mushrooms
  8             ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast or thigh
  2        tablespoons  finely-shredded ginger
  1         tablespoon  Shao Hsing rice cooking wine
  1         tablespoon  thin soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     scallion -- finely julienned

Rinse ham in cold water.  In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of cold water to a boil over high heat.  Add ham and return to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Drain ham, and set aside until cool enough to handle.  Slice the ham into paper-thin slices.  Stack a few slices at a time, and cut into julienne strips to make about 1/2 cup.

In a small bowl soak mushrooms in 1/2 cup cold water for about 30 minutes to soften.  When softened, drain and squeeze mushrooms dry, reserving the mushroom liquid.  Cut off and discard stems and thinly slice caps.

Cut chicken into scant 1/2-inch-thick slices, place in a medium bowl.  Add mushrooms, ginger, rice wine, thin soy sauce, black soy sauce, cornstarch, sesame oil, sugar and pepper and mix with your hands to combine.

Place the rice in a 2-quart saucepan.  Wash the rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear.  Drain the rice.  Level the rice and add enough cold water to cover by 1-inch.  (Or add 1 3/4 cups of water).  Bring to a boil, covered, over high heat, never stirring the rice.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 7 to 10 minutes or until the water almost completely evaporates.

Meanwhile, stir 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into the chicken mixture and combine thoroughly.  Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the wok and carefully add chicken mixture, spreading it in wok.  Cook undisturbed 1 minute, letting chicken begin to brown.  Then, using a metal spatula, stir-fry 1 minute or until chicken is lightly browned on all sides but not cooked through.  Add mushroom liquid and ham and cook, stirring, 30 seconds.

Uncover rice and quickly spread chicken mixture and scallions over it.  Immediately re-cover rice and cook 5 to 10 minutes more or until chicken is just cooked through and rice is tender.  Bring the pot to the table and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1 1/4         pounds  ground turkey
  4                     half-inch cubes of Brie cheese
                        Olive oil -- for brushing burgers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole rye berries - (13 oz)
  8               cups  boiling spring water - (64 fl oz)
  2               cups  rye sourdough starter - (18 oz)
  8               cups  medium ground rye flour - (40 oz)
  2               cups  cracked rye - (9 oz)
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt - (3/4 oz)

Soak the rye berries in about 6 cups of the hot spring water, or at least enough to cover berries by 1-inch.  Let stand 8 hours or overnight (if the water becomes completely absorbed before soaking time has ended, add more hot spring water to cover).  Drain and reserve the soaking liquid.  Add enough fresh room-temperature spring water to the reserved soaking liquid to measure 6 cups total.  Reserve.

Combine the starter, rye berries and reserved 6 cups water in a 6-quart bowl.  Break up the starter well with a wooden spoon and stir until it loosens and the mixture is slightly frothy.  Add 1 cup (5 1/2 ounces) of the rye flour and all the cracked rye.  Stir well until combined.  Add the salt and remaining flour.  Stir until combined and the mixture is wet and sticky.  Take the doughís temperature -- the ideal is 78 degrees.  Cover with a clean damp towel and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees) draft-free place.

Note:  If the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees put it in a cooler than 78 degree place, like the refrigerator, until the dough cools to 78 degrees.  If it is lower than 78 degrees, put it in a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms to 78 degrees.  The point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its fermentation.  If you have to move the dough, be gentle and donít jostle it, or the dough might deflate.

The dough will become spongy but not springy, distinctly sour-smelling and increased in volume by about 1/4.  Generously grease 2 (5- by 9- by 3-inch) loaf pans with vegetable shortening and dust with rye flour.  Turn the dough into the prepared pans.  Smooth the tops with a wet thin flexible cake spatula.  Cover the loaves with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately-warm (74 to 80 degree) draft free place until the dough has domed slightly and increased in volume again by 1/4.

Bake on center rack of a preheated 300 degree oven until the loaves have shrunk from the sides of the pan and the tops are dark brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Remove the loaves from the pans and hold the loaves upside down.  Strike the bottoms firmly with your finger.  If the sound is hollow, the breads are done.  If it doesnít sound hollow, bake 15 minutes longer.

Cool the pans for 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely on wire racks.  Let the bread rest 24 to 36 hours before eating.  It is very moist in the center when removed from oven, but as it cools the moisture distributes evenly throughout the bread.  It will keep for weeks at room temperature wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.

This recipe yields 2 (9- by 5-inch) loaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (abt 110 degrees)
  1 1/2           cups  warm milk -- (abt 110 degrees)
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
     1/2           cup  honey
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  soy flour -- (optional)
  5 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour - (to 6 1/2 cups)
     1/4           cup  melted butter
  1                cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3        tablespoons  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  raisins -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  chopped nuts -- (optional)
  2               cups  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  rum extract
  5        tablespoons  heavy cream - (to 7 tbspns)

In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften.  Add milk, shortening, honey, eggs, lemon juice, salt, soy flour, and 2 cups whole wheat flour.  Beat vigorously for 2 minutes.  Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.

Turn dough onto a floured work surface.  Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough.  Place dough into an oiled bowl.  Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil.  Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Turn dough onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half.  Roll each half with a rolling pin into a 12- by 18-inch rectangle.  Brush dough with melted butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border along one long side of the rectangle free of butter.

Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts.  Sprinkle evenly over each portion of dough.  Roll up into 2 (18-inch) cylinders and pinch the loose edge to the cylinder.  Cut into 30 rolls (15 from each cylinder) and place cut-side up into 2 parchment-lined 9- by 13-inch pans.  Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees (350 if using glass pans).  Bake for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the rolls reaches 190 degrees.  Leave the rolls in the pan to cool since they benefit from the steam -- it makes them softer.  Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes.

Combine powdered sugar, rum extract, and milk.  Mixture should be the consistency of honey (if it isnít, adjust by adding more cream to thin it or powdered sugar to thicken it).  Drizzle over the top of the rolls.

This recipe yields 30 rolls.

                           Wild Mushroom Salad

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shiitake mushrooms
  1                cup  crimini mushrooms
  1                cup  button mushrooms
  1                cup  morel mushrooms
  1                cup  portobello mushrooms
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  white peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  water
  3        tablespoons  clarified butter
  2                     shallots -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  yellow curry powder
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil, thyme, rosemary,
                        and parsley
     1/4           cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  Spanish olive oil
     1/4           cup  white truffle oil (or Hazelnut oil)
     3/4           cup  rice vinegar
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

The stems and caps of the mushrooms are used for different parts of the recipe, so separating them is the first step.  Take a knife and cut the stems from the caps of all the different mushroom varieties, put the caps in one bowl, and the stems in another.

Next we make a stock by placing all the mushroom stems into a pot, along with the bay leaves, white peppercorns, teaspoon of salt and water.  Bring that to a heavy boil, and let reduce.  All of this needs to reduce to 1/4 of a cup of finished stock, so patience is needed.  After about 15 to 20 minutes on high heat, take the stock and pour through a fine strainer, if 1/4 cup of liquid is left, discard the pulp and save the liquid off to one side.

Take the mushroom caps, and slice them.  Add the sliced mushroom caps and saute in butter until tender.  Then add in the shallots and garlic, and only saute for about another minute, or until the shallots and garlic are translucent.  Pull the saute pan off the stove, and add the curry powder, fresh herbs, red bell peppers, oils, rice vinegar, pinch of salt and pepper, and mushroom stock.

Pour this mixture into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour, to allow all the flavors and aromas of the stock to infuse into the mushrooms.

Strain this salad, and serve the mushrooms on one plate, and save the stock as a dressing.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  bacon drippings or vegetable oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- coarsely chopped

  3               cups  Al Dente Make-Ahead Rice -- (see recipe), reheat
     3/4           cup  toasted slivered almonds

Heat bacon drippings in large, deep skillet over moderate heat 1 minute.  Add onion and bell peppers and cook, stirring often, until onion is limp and golden, 5 to 8 minutes.  Mix in garlic, curry powder, marjoram, thyme, and cayenne and cook and stir 2 minutes.

Add tomatoes, chicken, currants, salt and black pepper; adjust heat so mixture bubbles gently, cover, and cook, stirring now and then, until flavors mingle and chicken is heated through -- about 15 minutes.  Mix in parsley, taste for salt and pepper, and adjust as needed.

Mound rice in heated, large, deep platter, ladle chicken mixture on top, sprinkle with almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Add tomatoes, chicken, currants, salt and black pepper; adjust heat so mixture bubbles gently, cover, and cook, stirring now and then, until flavors mingle and chicken is heated through -- about 15 minutes.  Mix in parsley, taste for salt and pepper, and adjust as needed.
