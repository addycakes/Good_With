                           'Famous' Steak Soup

Recipe By     :Larry Woodward
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  Kansas City strip steaks - (8 to 10 oz ea)
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
  3               cups  large-sliced mushrooms
     1/4           cup  butter -- plus
     3/4           cup  butter
  1                can  Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies
  1                can  diced tomatoes
  1                can  yellow hominy
     1/2           cup  flour
  6               cans  beef broth - (12 cups)
  1         tablespoon  beef browning sauce
                        Beef juices (saved from cutting steaks)
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
                        Water -- as needed
  4              large  red potatoes -- unpeeled, diced
  4              large  carrots -- sliced
  1                cup  frozen peas
  3               cups  chopped celery
     1/2         pound  fresh green beans

Grill steaks to medium doneness over charcoal fire with wet hickory chips for smoked flavor.  Remove from grill and set aside until cool enough to handle.  Cut lengthwise into three strips.  Saving all the juices from the steak, cut strips into various bite-size pieces.  Place in crockpot on HIGH. 
In large electric skillet, sautÈ onions and mushrooms in 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter until golden brown.  Place cooked onions and mushrooms in slow cooker with steak strips.  Add both cans of tomatoes and hominy. 
For roux (gravy-like thickening):  Add rest of butter (3/4 cup or 1 1/2 sticks) to skillet and melt at 250 degrees.  Slowly add 1/2 cup flour and stir well to brown.  Blend in beef broth, browning sauce and beef juices.  Add Worcestershire.  Add water, as needed, to reduce thickness of roux.  Consistency should be that of a thin, brown gravy. 
In boiler, partially cook potatoes, carrots, green beans, peas and celery.  Add vegetables and 1 cup of their cooking water to steak strips in 1 or 2 slow cookers.  Stir in roux, mixing ingredients well.  Continue cooking on HIGH for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to LOW and cook until vegetables reach desired tenderness. 
This recipe yields 12 to 20 servings.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             medium  onions -- julienned
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  dry white wine
  5             pounds  red or yellow potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into large dice
  8               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  hot water
  2              pints  fresh blueberries -- see * Note
                        (or 2 pkgs (16 oz ea) thawed frozen
                        blueberries)
  2 1/2           cups  vanilla custard cream
  8                     fresh mint sprigs
                        === VANILLA CUSTARD CREAM ===
  2               cups  milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
                        (or 2 tspns vanilla extract)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  5                     egg yolks
                        Fruit brandies such as kirsch
                        or framboise -- (optional)

* Note:  Other berries can be substituted for the blueberries. 
To make the Vanilla Custard Cream:  Combine the milk with split vanilla bean or extract in a 2-quart saucepan.  Bring to a slow simmer over medium heat.  Take the split vanilla bean, if using, out of the milk, scrape out the tiny seeds, and stir them into the hot milk.  Discard the bean husks. 
Whisk the sugar and egg yolks together in a mixing bowl for about 2 minutes, until the yolks turn pale yellow.  Pour half the simmering milk into the egg yolk/sugar mixture while gently whisking.  Return the mixture to the saucepan and place the pan over low heat.  Stir continuously with a wooden spoon -- be careful to reach into the corners of the saucepan -- until the cream thickens slightly and coats the spoon.  If you have an accurate thermometer, it should read 175 degrees. 
Immediately remove the pan from the heat and stir for 1 minute more to cool the mixture.  Do not allow the cream to boil, or the yolks will curdle.  Strain the cream through a medium-mesh strainer into a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to cool.  Makes 2 1/2 cups. (It will keep 2 days, covered with plastic wrap.)  The custard cream can be flavored with fruit brandies, if desired. 
Make a light sugar syrup by stirring the sugar with the hot water until the sugar dissolves.  Reserve 32 whole blueberries for decorating the bowls and puree the rest of the blueberries with the sugar syrup in two batches in a blender.  Strain the puree through the fine disk of a food mill or a medium-mesh strainer.  Chill.  (The puree can be made a day or two in advance.  The puree gels after about an hour in the refrigerator, so you'll need to put it in the blender just before serving to liquefy it again.) 
Ladle the chilled blueberry puree into wide bowls, then slowly ladle the Vanilla Custard Cream over it with a circular motion so it forms a decorative round pattern on top of the puree.  Sprinkle the soup with the whole blueberries.  Decorate each bowl with a sprig of mint. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
  6               cups  shredded savoy cabbage

Croutons:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place 6 slices (1/4-inch thick) day-old French bread on baking sheet.  Bake until lightly browned (8 to 10 minutes).  Croutons may be made up to 3 days ahead and stored in an airtight container.  Before serving, crisp them for 5 minutes in a 350-degree oven. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  leek, white part only -- thinly sliced
  2                     McIntosh apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut in 1/2" cubes
  10            ounces  celery root -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1                     bay leaf
  1                     thyme sprig
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  peeled fresh roasted chestnuts -- see * Note
  2             quarts  unsalted chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

* Note:  From about 1 1/4 pounds chestnuts in the shell or use dry-packed, bottled or vacuum-sealed peeled chestnuts. 
Heat oil in a stockpot or large casserole over medium heat.  Add onion, leek, apples, celery root, bay leaf, thyme, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until onions and leeks are soft but not colored. 
Add chestnuts and chicken stock and bring to the boil.  Lower heat to a simmer and cook, skimming the surface regularly for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the chestnuts can be mashed easily with a fork.  Add the heavy cream and simmer 5 to 10 minutes more, then remove from heat and discard bay leaf and thyme. 
Puree soup until smooth, using a blender, hand-held immersion blender or a food processor, and working in batches if necessary, pass it through a fine-mesh strainer.  You should have about 2 quarts of soup.  If you have more or if you think the soup is too thin -- it should have the consistency of a light cream soup -- simmer it over medium heat until slightly thickened.  Taste and, if necessary, adjust the seasoning. 
This soup can be cooled completely and stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or frozen up to a month.  Bring the soup to a boil before serving.  It needs to be hot for best enjoyment. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHIPOTLE CHILE PUREE ===
  2                     chipotle chilies
  1              small  roasted tomato
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        === SOUP ===
  1                     leek -- well rinsed,
                        and chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         quarts  vegetable stock or water
  1                     celery stalk -- cut in 2" pieces
  1             medium  potato -- (optional)
  2                     Haas avocados
  1                     grapefruit -- segmented with juice
  1                     lime -- freshly squeezed
                        Sea salt -- to taste

For the Chipotle Chile Puree:  Puree all ingredients in a blender jar until roughly blended.  Set aside. 
For the Soup:  Heat the vegetable oil in saucepan over medium heat and cook leeks until translucent.  Add the garlic and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until golden brown.  Add the celery, potato and a light sprinkle of salt.  Cook for 5 minutes.  Add the vegetable stock or water and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for another 35 minutes until the liquid is reduce to 1/2 the original volume.  Set aside to cool at room temperature. 
Puree the cooled liquid in a blender jar with the avocados, grapefruit segments and juice, and the lime juice.  Salt to taste.  Serve chilled with spooned chipotle on top. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Chef's Notes:  The chipotle variety is one of the more widely known chiles from the central state of Oaxaca.  They are smoked, ripened jalapenos sold dried or canned in adobo (a marinade).  If you are using dried chiles, remove the stems.  (Seeds and veins as well, if you prefer a milder sauce.)  Toast the chilies in a saute pan until slightly darkened and the aroma wafts from the pan, about 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Place toasted chilies in non-reactive bowl and cover with boiling water.  Let the chilies steep for about 20 minutes until reconstituted and then discard the water.  Chipotles sold in adobo are easier to use, they are canned and ready to go. 
The only avocados to use in Mexican cuisine are called Haas.  Shop for avocados that are slightly resistant to thumb pressure.  You can ripen rock hard avocados by placing them in a bowl and storing them somewhere warmer then room temperature.  It is easy enough but it takes three days for them to ripen, so be sure to plan ahead.

Chef&apos;s Notes:  The chipotle variety is one of the more widely known chiles from the central state of Oaxaca.  They are smoked, ripened jalapenos sold dried or canned in adobo (a marinade).  If you are using dried chiles, remove the stems.  (Seeds and veins as well, if you prefer a milder sauce.)  Toast the chilies in a saute pan until slightly darkened and the aroma wafts from the pan, about 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Place toasted chilies in non-reactive bowl and cover with boiling water.  Let the chilies steep for about 20 minutes until reconstituted and then discard the water.  Chipotles sold in adobo are easier to use, they are canned and ready to go.

The only avocados to use in Mexican cuisine are called Haas.  Shop for avocados that are slightly resistant to thumb pressure.  You can ripen rock hard avocados by placing them in a bowl and storing them somewhere warmer then room temperature.  It is easy enough but it takes three days for them to ripen, so be sure to plan ahead.

Recipe By     :Betty Rosbottom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             strips  lean bacon
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  6 1/2           cups  cauliflower florets - (to 7 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus more
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  5               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  milk

Fry bacon in large, heavy, deep-sided pot or saucepan over medium heat until crisp.  Drain on paper towels, then cover and reserve for garnish. 
Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings in pan and return pan to medium heat.  Add onions and stir and cook until softened and lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Add cauliflower florets, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoons dill and stock. 
Bring mixture to simmer, then lower heat.  Cover and cook until cauliflower pieces are completely tender when pierced with knife, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from heat. 
Puree soup in small batches in food processor, blender or food mill.  Return soup to pan in which it was cooked and stir in cream and milk.  Cover and refrigerate soup until thoroughly chilled, 4 to 6 hours or longer. 
When ready to serve, taste soup and season with additional salt if necessary.  (Cold foods almost always need extra salt to intensify their flavor.) 
Crumble or coarsely chop reserved bacon.  Ladle soup into 4 shallow soup bowls.  Sprinkle each with some bacon and some of remaining 1 tablespoon chopped dill. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CORN SOUP ===
  4                     corn ears
  1              large  onion -- quartered
  2               cups  milk
  1              large  fennel bulb -- diced
  1              large  onion -- diced
  4               cups  potatoes in 1/2" dice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === RED PEPPER PUR…E ===
  2              large  red peppers
  2          teaspoons  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

For corn soup:  Boil 4 quarts water.  Add corn; cook 3 minutes.  Remove corn from water and plunge it immediately into bowl of cold water to stop cooking.  Add quartered onion to boiling water. 
When corn is cool enough to handle, cut off kernels and set them aside.  Break up cobs, return them to pot and cook for an hour at a slow boil.  Strain corn stock and measure liquid; You should have about 6 cups. 
Add enough milk to make 8 cups liquid in all.  Return mixture to pot and add fennel and onion.  Simmer 15 minutes.  Add potatoes; cook 15 minutes more. 
Remove about 2 cups vegetables (more for a thicker soup) from pot using slotted spoon.  PurÈe in blender or processor with some of the liquid, and add purÈe back to the soup.  Add corn kernels, season well with salt and pepper and chill.  Correct seasoning and serve drizzled with red pepper purÈe. 
For roast pepper purÈe:  Pre-heat oven to 500 degrees.  Rub peppers with 2 teaspoons oil.  Arrange peppers on cookie sheet.  Roast 15 minutes, then remove.  Place peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 15 minutes, until cool enough to handle. 
Remove skins and seeds.  PurÈe in blender or processor with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.  Season with salt.  PurÈe can be made ahead of time and refrigerated. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        === SOUP ===
  6              large  ripe peaches
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1                cup  plain yogurt
     1/3           cup  peach nectar
     1/8           cup  Riesling
  1         tablespoon  minced crystallized ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
     1/2      teaspoon  minced orange zest
  1           teaspoon  five-spice or curry powder
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Mint sprigs
                        Plain yogurt
  24                    raspberries

To make soup:  Place peaches in boiling water for 2 minutes.  Remove and place in ice-water bath.  Gently pull off skin.  Halve and pit peaches. 
In food processor or blender, puree peaches, honey, yogurt, nectar, wine, crystallized ginger, mint, chives, orange zest and five-spice powder.  Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours. 
Adjust sweetness level, adding a little more yogurt to make sure soup is not so sweet that it will overpower wine. 
To serve:  Ladle into soup bowls.  Garnish with mint sprigs, a small dollop of yogurt and 4 raspberries per bowl placed carefully on top of yogurt.  Riesling is the recommended wine to accompany this soup, served as a hot-weather appetizer; second choice, Gewurztraminer. 
This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

Recipe By     :David Bruguera-McLaren
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  kangeroo tail -- browned, see * Note
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- diced
  2                     carrots -- diced
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2 1/2           cups  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  port
     1/2         bunch  fresh thyme
                        (or 2 tbspns dried thyme wrapped in
                        silver foil and pierced with a fork)
  2                     parsley storks (roots) or 1 medium parsnip
  1 1/2           cups  tomato paste
  5 1/2         quarts  beef stock
  4               cups  tomato puree
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === POTATO DUMPLINGS ===
  3              large  potatoes -- boiled, peeled
  1                     egg
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  flour

* Note:  Non-marsupial nations, do not despair.  David Bruguera-McLaren, chef de cuisine at The Melbourne Soup Kitchen in Australia, says we can substitute oxtails. 
Potato Dumplings:  Rice 3 potatoes, then stir in egg, salt and flour -- beat with a fork til fluffly.  Roll into 1-inch balls.  Drop in gently boiling salted water and cook for about 10 minutes.  Drain and hold until ready to serve. 
For the soup:  Brown the meat in a 450 degree oven, turning over once. 
Meanwhile, in a large stockpot, saute the onion, carrrot, celery, and garlic in the oil.  Deglaze the pot with the port, add red wine and bring to a boil.  Add the tomato paste and the parsley roots (or parsnip) tied together with the thyme.  Reduce to a simmer and cook down to half. 
Add the browned kangeroo tail (or oxtails) and coat thoroughly.  Add the stock, tomato puree, salt, and pepper -- bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 90 minutes.  Strain completely, reserving the meat to add to the soup later, and refrigerate until you can scoop all the fat off the top easily and discard. 
When getting ready to serve, prepare and cook the dumplings.  Then discard the congealed fat on top of the soup, bring the soup to a boil, and add the meat to it (discarding the bones). 
Ladle into bowls and spoon the dumplings into each.  Serve out back with crusty bread, a big salad, and lots of red wine. 
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 
Comments:  This recipe is Australian, if you had any doubt.  Oxtails are wonderful in this rich, deeply flavored and deeply satisfying cold-weather soup.  Serve hot as a meal, with crusty bread, salad, and red wine, while the cold wind beats against the door.

                    Karl Ratzsch's German Lentil Soup

Recipe By     :John Poulos
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dried lentils - (16 oz)
  3             quarts  ham stock
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  granulated garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  4              drops  hot pepper sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  ground caraway
     1/2      teaspoon  celery salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  chopped carrots
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  2        tablespoons  bacon grease
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  freshly-minced parsley
     1/2         pound  ham -- diced
                        Croutons -- for garnish

Pick over lentils, removing any grit.  Place in stockpot; add stock, bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, nutmeg, hot pepper sauce, caraway and celery salt.  Bring to boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes.  Add water as needed, up to 2 quarts, to retain soupy texture.  Stir in carrots, celery and onion and cook 10 minutes more. 
Meanwhile, in separate saucepan, combine bacon grease and flour.  Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until just browned, to make roux.  Add roux to soup, little by little, until soup has consistency of gravy.  Add parsley and ham, simmer 5 minutes more to heat through.  Serve hot, garnished with croutons. 
This recipe yields 12 servings. 
Comments:  Chicken stock can be substituted for ham stock, though the flavor of the soup will be a little different.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (4 to 5 lbs)
  4                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped
  1              bunch  parsley root - (if available) -- peeled, chopped
  2              large  onions -- chopped
  6                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  4                     parsnips - (to 6) -- peeled, chopped
  1                     celery root -- peeled, chopped,
                        if available (if not, add more celery)
  1              bunch  parsley -- finely chopped
  1            handful  fresh dill -- finely chopped
  4             quarts  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Matzo balls

For homemade matzo balls:  1 cup matzo meal mixed with 1/3 cup shortening or "schmaltz" (or "mock schmaltz"), 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt, a grind of white pepper, and 4 eggs -- beat together, refrigerate for an hour, then form into balls and refrigerate til ready to cook. 
[Schmaltz is rendered chicken fat.  Mock Schmaltz can be made by simmering one diced onion in a cup of light olive oil until the onion browns -- then removing the onion and stirring in 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon granules.  Strain the oil into a jar and refrigerate.  Use, when solidified, as needed.] 
Put all ingredients in a big pot, cover, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, lightly covered, for 2 hours -- until everything is tender and soft.  Skim off foam, from time to time, if needed. 
Make matzo balls and refrigerate. 
After 2 hours, remove the chicken and pick, discarding skin and bones.  Cut into bite-sized pieces. 
Fish out half or so of the cooked vegetables and whirl into a blender, then returning to soup for thickening.  Stir in the chicken and season to taste with salt and pepper.  At this point, you can refrigerate overnight so flavors can blend -- then skim fat before reheating. 
Return to a low boil, add matzo balls, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.  Ladle into bowls, help your sick ones to the table, and watch them come back to life. 
Comments:  An authentic Belgian/Jewish grandmother's recipe for Chicken Soup.  It's wonderful -- and certainly delivers in the "make well" department.

  2                     washed leeks, white part only -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  1 1/2         pounds  Yukon potatoes -- cut large chunks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  green beans -- cut 1/2" lengths
  1              large  zucchini -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2             medium  boiling potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1                can  cannellini beans - (16 oz) -- drained
     1/4           cup  broken thin pasta, such as vermicelli
  1                cup  coarsely-shredded Swiss cheese
                        === PISTOU ===
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground pepper -- to taste

To make soup:  In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring often, until they form a sauce, 10 to 15 minutes. 
Add 6 cups water and season with salt and pepper.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.  Add the green beans, zucchini and potatoes and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add the cannellini beans and 2 cups water.  Add the vermicelli.  Cook until all the vegetables and pasta are tender, about 5 minutes longer. 
Meanwhile, to make pistou:  Place the basil and garlic in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade and blend to a coarse paste.  With the machine running, add oil to make a thick green paste.  Season with salt and pepper. 
To finish:  Stir the pistou into the soup.  Serve the soup in individual bowls, passing a bowl of Swiss cheese so each diner can add it to taste. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP ===
  2             pounds  asparagus -- 16 tips reserved
     3/4           cup  sliced leeks, white part only
  1                     celery rib
     1/2                white onion
  3                     basil leaves
  3               cups  cold water
     3/4           cup  stemmed flat-leaf parsley
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- (optional)
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  soft goat cheese -- room temperature
                        === TOMATO CONFIT ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and quartered lengthwise
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                     thyme sprig
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Soup:  Puree asparagus, leeks, celery, and onion in food processor until smooth.  Transfer to nonreactive pot to boil.  Cook with basil and water until soft, about 10 minutes at light boil. 
Transfer to blender with flat leaf parsley and blend until smooth.  Strain through chinoise or fine mesh sieve and return to heat.  Add cream, if desired, juice of 1/2 lemon and season with salt and pepper.  (Adjust thickness to your liking with additional water if cream is entirely deleted, or if soup is too thick.) 
Tomato confit:  Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Line a baking tray with foil and spread tomatoes evenly.  Add garlic, thyme and sprinkle with a generous amount of kosher salt.  Evenly drizzle olive oil over tomatoes and place in oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until tomatoes are fully cooked and have absorbed all liquid and oil.  Cool and set aside (can be done 1 day prior to serving). 
Select 4 best tomato pieces and puree the remainder for garnish. 
To assemble:  Divide soup into 4 even portions.  Using 2 teaspoons, form a quenelle (football shape) of soft goat cheese and place in center of soup.  Reheat tomato pieces and place atop 1/2 of the formed goat cheese, distributing evenly, allowing a contrast between the two.  Place small dots of tomato puree to garnish (easily done with a squirt bottle or small spoon). 
Steam or lightly saute the remaining 16 asparagus tips and garnish each soup with 4 pieces.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings (about 6 cups).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter or oil
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
  5             medium  shallots - (to 6) -- peeled, sliced
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon or lime zest
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon or lime juice

Melt the butter or heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet.  Add the onion and shallots, and saute over medium heat for about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle in the salt and mustard, lower the heat, and saute for another 20 minutes. 
Cover, turn the heat way down, and cook for another 45 minutes.  The onions and shallots will become very soft.  Turn up the heat to medium, cover again, and cook for a final 5 minutes or so. 
Remove from the heat, and stir in the lemon or lime zest and juice.  Serve at room temperature or cold.  The marmalade will keep for several weeks if stored in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.  Serve with "Root Vegetable Soup" (see recipe). 
This recipe yields 1/2 cup. 
Comments:  It's easier to peel the shallots if you blanch them first in boiling water for about 5 minutes.

Melt the butter or heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet.  Add the onion and shallots, and saute over medium heat for about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle in the salt and mustard, lower the heat, and saute for another 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover, turn the heat way down, and cook for another 45 minutes.  The onions and shallots will become very soft.  Turn up the heat to medium, cover again, and cook for a final 5 minutes or so. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat, and stir in the lemon or lime zest and juice.  Serve at room temperature or cold.  The marmalade will keep for several weeks if stored in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.  Serve with &quot;Root Vegetable Soup&quot; (see recipe). 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1/2 cup. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  It&apos;s easier to peel the shallots if you blanch them first in boiling water for about 5 minutes.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2         ounces  pancetta or bacon -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1             medium  peeled diced carrot
  1                rib  celery rib -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried rosemary, crushed)
  1                cup  lentils -- picked over
  1                cup  diced seeded fresh tomatoes or
                        canned Italian plum tomatoes -- drained
  4               cups  boiling water
  4               cups  low-sodium chicken broth
     3/4           cup  rice -- preferably Arborio
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        pecorino cheese

Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat.  Add the pancetta, onion, carrot and celery and saute until the vegetables begin to turn golden, about 5 minutes. 
Add the garlic, rosemary, lentils and tomatoes.  Stir well and cook, uncovered, to blend the flavors, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the boiling water, cover and cook until the lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. 
Add the chicken broth, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.  Stir in the rice, then reduce the heat to a very slow but steady simmer.  Cover and cook until the rice is al dente (tender but still firm to the bite), about 15 minutes. 
Taste for seasoning, adding salt, if needed, and black pepper.  Serve in warmed bowls, each serving sprinkled generously with the grated cheese. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                           Root Vegetable Soup

Recipe By     :Mollie Katzen, "Vegetable"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter or vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger - (to 4 tbspns)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1             medium  rutabaga -- peeled, diced
  2              small  turnips -- peeled, diced
  1             medium  sweet potato or yam -- peeled, diced
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  1                     parsnip - (abt 8") -- peeled, diced
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, diced
  6               cups  water
  1                     cinnamon stick
                        Grated fresh horseradish
                        Toast -- (optional)
                        Red Onion And Shallot Marmalade -- (see recipe)

Melt the butter or heat the oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven.  Add the onion, garlic, ginger and 1/2 teaspoon salt; saute over low heat for about 10 minutes.  Stir in remaining vegetables and another teaspoon of salt.  Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 more minutes. 
Add the water and the cinnamon stick.  Bring to a boil, then turn the heat way down.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.  Remove the cinnamon stick, cover again, and continue to simmer for about 5 more minutes, or until the vegetables are completely tender. 
Place about a quarter of the vegetables and some of their cooking liquid in a food processor or blender, and process briefly to thicken (but not necessarily to puree) the soup.  Return the processed batch to the rest of the soup, and stir it in.  This treatment gives the soup a delightful, varied texture. 
Serve hot, with a very light sprinkling of grated fresh horseradish on top (go easy), and slices of crisp toast spread thickly with Red Onion And Shallot Marmalade on the side, if desired.  This soup freezes if stored in an airtight container. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Instead of peeling the vegetables, you can scrub them with a good stiff brush.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  barley
  1 1/2           cups  water
     3/4           cup  chopped onions
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     chicken breast halves -- raw, diced
     1/2         pound  chicken livers -- cut into halves
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                cup  sliced carrots in rounds
  2                     potatoes -- diced
  8               cups  chicken broth
  2                     dill pickles -- diced
     1/4           cup  pickle juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  sour cream
  1              bunch  fresh dill

Simmer the barley in the water until soft.  Drain. 
In a Dutch oven, stir the carrots and potatoes into the boiling chicken broth, reduce heat, and simmer until soft. 
In a skillet, saute the onion in the butter until translucent.  Add chicken and livers and continue to saute over high heat until the livers start to crust a little bit.  Stir in the flour, then pour in a little stock from the vegetables, scrape up all the good bits, and pour all into the stock pot.  Also add the barley.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Stir in the pickles and the salt and pepper. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, then stir in a big tablespoon of sour cream into each bowl and top with fresh chopped dill. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4 to 6 friends or 3 Volga boatmen. 
Comments:  Really doesn't sound like it's going to work at all -- but, oh, is it good. 
This national soup, touted for being a surefire cure for hangovers, graced 18th century aristocratic tables in a variation that included the highest quality caviar.  The truly key ingredient, however, is rassol or "pickle juice" -- a true staple of Russian cuisine.  Because pickles vary from household to household, variations of Rassolnik are legion (pitersky, moskovsky, troitsky, etc.) and have even come to include the exotica of watermelons, pears, or cherries.

In a skillet, saute the onion in the butter until translucent.  Add chicken and livers and continue to saute over high heat until the livers start to crust a little bit.  Stir in the flour, then pour in a little stock from the vegetables, scrape up all the good bits, and pour all into the stock pot.  Also add the barley.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Stir in the pickles and the salt and pepper.

When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, then stir in a big tablespoon of sour cream into each bowl and top with fresh chopped dill.

This national soup, touted for being a surefire cure for hangovers, graced 18th century aristocratic tables in a variation that included the highest quality caviar.  The truly key ingredient, however, is rassol or &quot;pickle juice&quot; -- a true staple of Russian cuisine.  Because pickles vary from household to household, variations of Rassolnik are legion (pitersky, moskovsky, troitsky, etc.) and have even come to include the exotica of watermelons, pears, or cherries.

Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fruit                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  sour cherries
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  red-wine vinegar
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  ice water
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Sour cream -- (optional), see * Note
                        Ground cinnamon

* Note:  If serving as a dessert, double the amount of sugar and substitute dollop of ice cream or sorbet for the sour cream. 
Reserve 6 whole cherries.  Pass the remaining cherries through a food mill (the food mill is used to get rid of the skins and pits, so a food processor is not a good substitute) fitted with the medium disk into a metal bowl.  Whisk the remaining ingredients except the sour cream and ground cinnamon into the cherry juice.  Refrigerate until cold. 
Pour the soup into bowls and top each serving with a dollop of sour cream (if using for first course), one of the reserved cherries and a sprinkle of cinnamon. 
This recipe yields 5 cups; serves 5 to 6 as first course or dessert.

Reserve 6 whole cherries.  Pass the remaining cherries through a food mill (the food mill is used to get rid of the skins and pits, so a food processor is not a good substitute) fitted with the medium disk into a metal bowl.  Whisk the remaining ingredients except the sour cream and ground cinnamon into the cherry juice.  Refrigerate until cold.

Pour the soup into bowls and top each serving with a dollop of sour cream (if using for first course), one of the reserved cherries and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

This recipe yields 5 cups; serves 5 to 6 as first course or dessert.

                         Southwestern Ratatouille

Recipe By     :Beverly Bundy
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              small  eggplant or 1/2 large eggplant -- peeled, diced
  1              large  zucchini -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  1                     serrano chile -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
     1/4           cup  dark beer or ale - (to 1/2 cup)
  2              large  tomatoes -- cored, diced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder - (to 1/2 tspn)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hot -- cooked rice

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet.  Add onion, garlic, eggplant, zucchini and serrano chile and saute over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.  Pour in 1/4 cup beer and scrape up any vegetables that stick to the bottom of the skillet. 
Add tomatoes, cumin and chili powder and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding another 1/4 cup beer if it starts to look dry.  (Mixture should be soupy.)  If beer is bitter, add sugar.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in cilantro.  Serve over hot rice. 
South of France, southwestern U.S. -- it's not that far-fetched.  This spicy version, from Beverly Bundy of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, originally called for chipotle chile powder.  We substituted regular chili powder because it's easier to find.  But you if have the smoky chipotle version, by all means use it. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  8             ounces  Canadian bacon -- cut 1/2" dice
  2               cups  diced onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  3              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice (abt 5 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8               cups  chicken stock or broth
                        Salt to taste
                        Lemon juice -- (optional)

In a large stockpot over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the Canadian bacon and cook until browned.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until golden.  Add the apples, sweet potatoes, cayenne and black peppers and stock or broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sweet potatoes are soft, about 1 hour. 
Add salt to taste and adjust the seasonings accordingly.  If the soup is too sweet, add a bit of lemon juice.  If you prefer more of a puree, cook for an additional 20 to 30 minutes. 
Ladle into individual soup bowls and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  For drama, warm 1/4 cup of bourbon and ignite it as you pour it into the soup tureen.  The show is great, the taste even better.

     1/4           cup  cream or half-and-half - (to 1/2 cup)
                        === CRISPY SEAWEED ===
                        Savoy cabbage
                        Oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Sugar -- to taste

Melt the butter in a heavy pan.  When it foams, add the potatoes and onions and turn them in the butter until well coated.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover and sweat on low heat for 10 minutes.  Add the stock (heat it first if you want to speed things up) and cook until the potatoes are soft.  Add the cabbage and cook, uncovered, until the cabbage is just cooked -- a matter of 4 to 5 minutes.  Keeping the lid off retains the green color. 
To make the Crispy Seaweed:  Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage and cut out the stalks.  Roll the leaves into cigar shapes and slice across into the thinnest possible shreds with a very sharp knife. 
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees.  Toss in some cabbage and cook for just a few seconds.  As soon as it starts to crisp, remove and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with salt and sugar.  Toss, and serve as a garnish on the soup or just nibble; it is quite addictive -- worse than peanuts or popcorn! 
Puree the soup in a blender or food processor.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Add the cream before serving.  Serve alone or with a mound of Crispy Seaweed on top. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  The idea of cabbage soup may not thrill you, but just try this one.  Use the freshest, greenest cabbage and take great care not to overcook it.  Cook and eat, don't reheat!  The Crispy Seaweed can be used as a garnish or served separately, as an appetizer.

                        and cut into 1/2" dice (abt 2 cups)
  1 1/4           cups  1% low-fat milk
  1 1/2           cups  shredded pepper Jack cheese - (6 oz)

In a large, heavy, deep pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, just until softened, about 3 minutes. 
Add the corn and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the chicken broth, salt and pepper.  Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until corn is tender, about 15 minutes.  Add the zucchini and cook until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more.  Remove from the heat; set aside.  (If you plan to freeze the soup, do so at this point.  Cool, cover and freeze, defrost before continuing.) 
In a medium saucepan, place the milk and heat over medium heat until hot but not boiling.  Gradually whisk in the cheese, a handful at a time, making certain each addition has melted before adding more.  When all has been incorporated and the mixture is smooth, remove from the heat. 
Place the soup over medium heat and gradually pour the cheese mixture into it, stirring constantly.  Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired.  Ladle into bowls and serve hot. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     green onions
  2                     celery ribs
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, seeded
  1                     green bell pepper
  1                cup  green seedless grapes
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves - (loosely packed)
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  green hot sauce -- see * Note
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  1                cup  bottled white grape juice

* Note:  Recipe tested with Tabasco brand green pepper sauce; if using another with a different level of Scoville units -- strength of heat -- add it cautiously to taste.  Some green hot sauces are fiery. 
Trim the green onions, celery ribs, cucumber and green bell pepper; then cut all into large pieces.  Place in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Add the grapes, cilantro, lime juice, green hot sauce and salt.  Cover and pulse ingredients just to combine, but do not puree. 
With machine running, pour white grape juice through the feed tube and pulse machine just to combine ingredients.  Pour into a glass bowl or jar and chill thoroughly before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This unusual recipe was developed by the Tabasco company to showcase its version of green hot sauce.  The thing I like about the recipe is that the heat is balanced by the natural sweetness of the other ingredients, mostly seedless green grapes and bottled white grape juice.  Cilantro lends its distinctive touch for a cold soup of great character.  Enjoy it with roast turkey sandwiches, or ham, if you like.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1              small  jalapeÒo chili -- cored, seeded
                        and minced, or 2 cored, seeded and
                        minced small red chilies,
  1              small  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
  1                     shallot -- peeled, minced
     1/2           cup  corn kernels
  2               cups  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  low-fat unsweetened coconut milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Thai fish sauce (nam pla) -- sold in most
                        Asian markets
  6             ounces  medium-size raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  lime juice - (to 3 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  minced cilantro
  1         tablespoon  minced green onion
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in medium pan.  Add ginger, chili, red bell pepper, shallot and corn; saute over medium heat until bell pepper is tender, about 10 minutes.  Add broth; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low.  Add coconut milk, fish sauce and shrimp.  Simmer until shrimp are cooked through, about 5 minutes. 
Stir in 2 tablespoons lime juice, cilantro and green onion.  Season with pepper.  Taste.  Soup should be hot and tangy.  If not, add additional 1 tablespoon lime juice. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  This time of the winter when I want a hot entree -- fast -- I often make soup.  I start with a chicken-broth base and add whatever's available.  A refrigerator filled with odds and ends of vegetables inspired a Thai-style shrimp soup.  It's delicious, ready in minutes and can be adapted to be used with whatever vegetables the refrigerator yields.

Comments:  This time of the winter when I want a hot entree -- fast -- I often make soup.  I start with a chicken-broth base and add whatever&apos;s available.  A refrigerator filled with odds and ends of vegetables inspired a Thai-style shrimp soup.  It&apos;s delicious, ready in minutes and can be adapted to be used with whatever vegetables the refrigerator yields.

               Tomato Vegetable Stew With Cheddar Dumplings

Recipe By     :Martha White Kitchen, Knoxville, TN
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR STEW ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  onions -- coarsely chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- coarsely chopped
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (28 oz) -- undrained
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  2               cups  frozen Italian green beans
  1           teaspoon  dried basil leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  hot sauce -- or to taste
                        Salt -- (optional)
                        === FOR DUMPLINGS ===
  1 1/2           cups  self-rising flour -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4           cup  shortening
     1/2           cup  shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
     2/3           cup  milk

* Note:  If no self-rising flour is on hand, or if it's so old the leavening power is in question, use 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour blended with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and a generous 1/4 teaspoon salt. 
To prepare stew:  In a Dutch oven with lid, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add onions and celery.  Cook, stirring, until celery is tender.  Add tomatoes with juice, chicken broth, green beans, basil and hot sauce.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until beans are tender.  Taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt if necessary. 
To prepare dumplings:  Place flour and dry mustard in a medium mixing bowl; stir well.  Using a pastry blender or 2 table knives, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in Cheddar.  Add milk; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened.  Drop dough by tablespoonfuls over the simmering stew.  Cover and cook over medium-low for heat 10 to 15 minutes or until dumplings are firm. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE BEANS ===
  7               cups  dried cannellini beans
                        or Great Northern beans
  2                     bay leaves
  5                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2                     celery ribs -- cut in half
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut in half
  4                     fresh oregano sprigs
  3          teaspoons  salt
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh oregano
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
                        Vegetable stock or chicken stock -- as needed
                        Stewed Fresh Summer Tomatoes -- (see recipe)

For the beans:  Soak the beans overnight in water to cover by about 3 inches; they will expand and absorb a lot of water. 
Drain the beans, then place them in a large stock pot.  Add the bay leaves, whole garlic cloves, celery, carrot and oregano sprigs.  Add enough fresh water to cover by 3 inches.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the beans are cooked through but still al dente, 35 to 45 minutes for Great Northerns, 45 minutes to 1 hour for cannellinis.  About 10 minutes before the beans finish cooking, add the salt. 
While the beans are cooking, make the Stewed Fresh Summer Tomatoes. 
To finish the soup:  When the beans are done, strain them over a pot, reserving their cooking water.  Remove and discard the bay leaves, garlic, celery, carrot and oregano sprigs. 
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy stock pot over medium heat.  Add the minced garlic and oregano and cook until the garlic releases its aroma, about 2 minutes.  Add the beans and saute for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Place half of the beans in a blender or food processor with enough of the reserved cooking water to allow them to move freely.  Puree until smooth. 
Return the bean puree to the whole beans, then stir in the remaining bean-cooking water and the parsley.  Heat the soup through, adding vegetable or chicken stock to thin it, if desired. 
To serve, ladle the soup into bowls.  Using a slotted spoon, scoop a few spoonfuls of stewed tomatoes over each serving. 
This recipe yields 12 servings.

                Tuscan Pumpkin, White Bean And Turkey Soup

Recipe By     :Natalie Haughton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  5               cups  turkey, chicken or vegetable broth -- (to 6 cups)
  1                can  pumpkin puree 100% pure - (15 oz)
  1                can  cannellini or Great Northern beans -- (15 oz), drained
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped cooked turkey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnishing

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a soup pot.  Add onion, celery and garlic.  Saute, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes, until vegetables are very soft and just beginning to brown. 
Add broth and pumpkin, stirring until smooth.  Simmer 15 minutes.  Stir in beans and turkey; season with salt and pepper.  Continue simmering until heated through, about 10 minutes. 
Serve soup hot and drizzle a teaspoon or so of olive oil over top of each portion and sprinkle with cheese. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Pumpkin and white bean soup is a favorite cold-weather combination and the post-Thanksgiving addition of leftover roast turkey makes this Americanized version hearty enough to be a main course.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  dried chickpeas -- (about 5 cups)
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs
  3                     bay leaves
  1              large  rosemary sprig
  5              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  5                     carrots -- cut 1/2" pieces
  4                     inner celery ribs -- cut 1/4" pieces
  3                     onions -- cut 1/4" dice
  1              pound  salt pork -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped parsley
  4       thick slices  crusty toasted garlic bread
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Place the chickpeas in a large bowl; pour in warm water to cover by 4 inches.  Soak for 24 hours; drain. 
Transfer the chickpeas to a large soup pot; pour in fresh water to cover by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil; boil for 10 minutes, skimming from time to time. Drain. 
Return the chickpeas to the pot and add 18 cups cold water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Bundle together the thyme, bay leaves and rosemary; tie with kitchen string.  Add this bouquet garni and the garlic to the pot.  Reduce heat; simmer for 30 minutes. 
Add carrots, celery, onions and salt pork; simmer for 30 minutes.  Add salt; simmer until the chickpeas are very tender and the liquid is cloudy and slightly thickened, about 2 hours total cooking time. 
Fifteen minutes before the chickpeas are done, remove the salt pork.  Finely chop and reserve all the meat.  Finely dice a small piece of the fat and add to the meat.  Discard remaining fat. 
When the chickpeas are cooked, discard the bouquet garni.  Transfer about 7 cups of the chickpeas and vegetables and about 5 cups of the liquid to a heated soup tureen.  Stir in the reserved meat and parsley. 
(Drain remaining chickpeas and vegetables, reserving the cooking liquid.  Let chickpeas and liquid cool to room temperature, then store in separate covered containers in the refrigerator.  Will keep for up to 5 days.) 
To serve stew:  Place a slice of garlic toast in each serving bowl, then ladle in the stew.  Dust with pepper; serve with grated cheese. 
This recipe yields 4 servings stew, plus 8 cups chickpeas and 6 cups liquid.

Recipe By     :Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  sliced peeled baking potatoes
  3               cups  sliced cleaned leeks, white and
                        pale green parts only
  6               cups  chicken stock, homemade,
                        or low-sodium commercial
     1/2           cup  cream - (to 1 cup)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  minced chives

Combine the potatoes, leeks and stock in a large pot.  Bring to a boil, then simmer, partly covered, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes. 
Cool slightly, then puree in a blender, food processor or food mill.  Remove the soup to a covered container and chill at least 4 hours or up to 3 days. 
Before serving, add as much cream as desired and season with salt and pepper. 
Serve in shallow bowls and garnish with chives. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Chilled Watercress Soup:  Decrease leeks to 2 cups; add leaves from 1 bunch washed and drained watercress 5 minutes before cooking time is finished.  Omit chives and garnish with watercress sprigs. 
Chilled Spinach Soup:  Proceed as above, substituting leaves from 1 bunch spinach for the watercress and adding 1 chopped garlic clove to the potato/leek mixture.  Add a few grindings of nutmeg. 
Chilled Pepper Soup:  Decrease leeks to 2 cups; add 1/2 to 1 cup peeled, roasted red bell peppers (prepared at home or from a jar) before pureeing the soup.  Garnish with chopped chives or chopped chervil. 
Chilled Asparagus Soup:  Decrease leeks to 2 cups; add 1 minced garlic clove to the potato/leek mixture, and add 1 to 1 1/2 cups blanched and cut-up asparagus spears along with 3 tablespoons nonfat dry milk to the mixture 5 minutes before cooking time is up.  For a low-calorie version, skip the cream enrichment or use only a tablespoon or two -- the nonfat dry milk makes this creamy without adding fat. 
Comments:  Using this, from "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," by Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child (Alfred A. Knopf), as a Master Recipe, you can prepare a number of delicious summer soups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1 1/2 cups)

  1              small  fresh bay leaf -- see * Note
  10            ounces  zucchini - (abt 2 med) -- unpeeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, seeds discarded and
                        flesh cut into chunks
  1                cup  chicken broth or water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === FOR THE GARNISH ===
  1                     leek, white part only -- julienned
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  potato starch or cornstarch
  2             ounces  speack (smoked shoulder prosciutto) -- julienned
                        (or substitute prosciutto)
  1                cup  Caponata -- (see recipe)

* Note:  Fresh bay leaves are available in the produce section of Fresh Fields stores. 
For the soup:  In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the clove of garlic in 3 tablespoons of the oil until browned.  Remove and discard the clove of garlic. 
Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, leeks and bay leaf.  Cover and cook until the vegetables soften, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the zucchini; cover and cook for 2 minutes.  Add enough chicken broth or water to cover the vegetable mixture; season to taste with salt.  Cover and simmer for 25 minutes.  Remove the soup from the heat; remove and discard the bay leaf.  Set aside to cool. 
For the garnish:  Place the leek in a bowl of ice water; set aside for 20 minutes. 
In a deep pan, pour the oil to a depth of about 1 inch and heat over medium-high heat.  Have ready a plate lined with paper towels. 
Drain the leek and pat dry with paper towels.  Coat the leek with potato starch or corn starch.  Transfer the leek to a wire strainer and shake to remove any excess starch. 
Add the leek to the oil and fry until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the leek to the paper towels to drain. 
In a nonstick pan, saute the speack until lightly browned around the edges, 4 to 5 minutes.  Carefully transfer the speack to the paper towels to drain. 
To assemble, transfer the cooled soup to a blender or food processor and puree.  Return the soup to the pan and bring to a boil.  Whisk in enough oil to make the mixture creamy.  Remove from the heat and cool slightly. 
Meanwhile, with an egg cup, metal ring or measuring cup, shape about 1/4 cup of the Caponata into a small mound in the center of a soup bowl.  Repeat with the remaining caponata.  Pour or ladle the warm soup (not hot, not cold) around (not over) the caponata.  Garnish with the leeks and speack.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  garlic clove
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  diced red tomatoes
     1/3           cup  diced cucumber
  2 1/4           cups  vegetable-tomato juice, such as V8
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/3           cup  diced green bell pepper
     1/3           cup  chopped red onions
     1/4           cup  diced celery
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
                        Hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
                        Freshly-ground black pepper to taste
     3/4           cup  cooked white beans, such as Great
                        Northern or cannellini
  2 1/2    tablespoons  coarsely-chopped mint leaves

On a cutting board, mash the garlic clove with the salt to create a paste.  Set aside. 
In a blender, combine 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the cucumbers, 1/2 of the vegetable-tomato juice and the oil.  Cover and blend on high speed until the solids are pureed, about 1 minute. 
Pour the contents of the blender into a nonreactive bowl; stir in the remaining tomatoes, cucumbers and vegetable-tomato juice along with the green peppers, onions, celery, parsley, hot pepper sauce, vinegar and oregano.  Blend in the garlic-salt paste, mixing well.  Season with pepper to taste.  Stir in the cooked beans.  Cover tightly and chill thoroughly, at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours. 
Stir the mint into the chilled soup just before serving. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Cooked white beans provide a texture that contrasts nicely with the fresh vegetables, which are bolstered by the bright taste of chopped mint.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             slices  French bread -- crusts removed
  1 1/2           cups  chopped peeled seeded cucumber
     2/3           cup  chopped celery
     1/3           cup  blanched almonds
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  plain nonfat yogurt
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1        small bunch  seedless green grapes -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Soak bread in ice water 10 minutes.  Squeeze out water and place bread in food processor with cucumber, celery, almonds and garlic.  Process until smooth.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  fat-free low-salt chicken broth
  2 1/2           cups  canned diced tomatoes, including juice
     1/2        medium  yellow onion -- sliced (1 cup)
  1             medium  carrot -- sliced (1/2 cup)
  2             medium  celery stalks -- sliced (1 cup)
  1                cup  sliced white cabbage
  2             ounces  uncooked fusilli pasta - (1 cup)
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  2               cups  fresh spinach -- washed
  1 1/2           cups  rinsed and drained canned red beans
  2             ounces  shredded low-fat Cheddar cheese - (1/2
                        cup)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sourdough or whole grain bread

Preheat oven to warm bread.  Bring chicken broth and tomatoes to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion, carrots and celery.  Cover, lower heat to medium and cook on a slow boil 10 minutes.  Add cabbage and fusilli.  Raise heat and boil, uncovered, 10 minutes. 
Mix horseradish and vinegar.  Add to soup with spinach and beans.  Boil 2 minutes.  Pasta will be cooked.  Spinach will just be wilted.  Add cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Place bread in oven to warm. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  Imagine a soup that provides a whole meal in one bowl and takes only 30 minutes to make.  That's the beauty of Winter Casserole Soup, a thick and hearty soup made with vegetables, pasta and red kidney beans. 
Soup is a great way to brighten up a winter evening.  I find that my family, no matter what the weather, loves a bowl of soup.  It warms them up and gets them chatting arounnd the table. 
You can make this a vegetarian meal by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Horseradish and vinegar add a little kick and help the flavors of the vegetables blend.  The cheddar cheese adds flavor and texture. 
This tastes great the second day.  You can double the recipe and have another quick meal waiting for you.  If you make it in advance or are rewarming on the second night, it may become too thick.  Just add more broth. 
This is the type of meal that you can improvise if you haven't been to the supermarket.  I keep chicken broth, canned tomatoes and canned beans on hand for quick dinners.  Also, I normally have onions, celery and carrots in the refrigerator.  If you don't have spinach or cabbage, leave them out or use frozen spinach plus lettuce and any fresh greens you have in the refrigerator.  Use any type of short, cut pasta such as elbow macaroni or penne.  Or, use up different types of pasta you have.  If they're long, break them into smaller pieces. 
This meal contains 542 calories per serving with 14 percent of calories from fat.

                            Winter Pistou Soup

Recipe By     :Beverly Mills, with Alicia Ross
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  elbow macaroni - (2 oz)
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              large  carrot - (abt 1/2 cup sliced)
  1              large  onion - (1 cup chopped)
  2          teaspoons  bottled minced garlic
  1                can  beef broth - (14 1/2 oz) -- fat removed
  1                can  fat-free chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  stewed tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Herbes de Provence seasoning blend
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  frozen green beans
  1                can  Great Northern beans - (15 oz) -- drained
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Spinach Parsley Pesto -- (see recipe)

Bring 5 cups of unsalted water to a boil in a covered 2-quart or larger pot over high heat.  When the water reaches a rapid boil, add the pasta and cook 7 minutes (done but still firm). 
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven or soup pot over low heat.  Peel the carrot and thinly slice it, adding the pieces to the pot as you slice.  Raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally.  Peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to the pot as you chop.  Add the garlic and continue to cook, stirring until the carrots are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. 
While the vegetables cook, remove any visible fat from the beef broth.  Raise the heat to high.  Immediately add the beef and chicken broths, the stewed tomatoes, Herbes de Provence seasoning and sugar.  Cover the pot and bring the soup to a boil. 
Meanwhile, place the green beans in a microwave-safe dish and microwave at high, uncovered, for 2 minutes. 
When the soup is boiling, add the green beans and Great Northern beans.  Let the soup boil, covered, for about 5 more minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium-high if necessary.  The macaroni will be just done during this time.  Drain it and, in the last minute of soup boiling, add it to the soup pot.  Season with black pepper to taste.  Top each serving with 1 tablespoon Spinach Parsley Pesto.  Serve at once. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  If you don't have Herbes de Provence seasoning, substitute Italian seasoning blend.  If the pesto is frozen, unwrap, place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave, uncovered, at 50 percent power until defrosted, about 1 minute.

Raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally.  Peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to the pot as you chop.  Add the garlic and continue to cook, stirring until the carrots are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the vegetables cook, remove any visible fat from the beef broth.  Raise the heat to high.  Immediately add the beef and chicken broths, the stewed tomatoes, Herbes de Provence seasoning and sugar.  Cover the pot and bring the soup to a boil. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, place the green beans in a microwave-safe dish and microwave at high, uncovered, for 2 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the soup is boiling, add the green beans and Great Northern beans.  Let the soup boil, covered, for about 5 more minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium-high if necessary.  The macaroni will be just done during this time.  Drain it and, in the last minute of soup boiling, add it to the soup pot.  Season with black pepper to taste.  Top each serving with 1 tablespoon Spinach Parsley Pesto.  Serve at once. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If you don&apos;t have Herbes de Provence seasoning, substitute Italian seasoning blend.  If the pesto is frozen, unwrap, place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave, uncovered, at 50 percent power until defrosted, about 1 minute.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  zucchini -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
     1/3           cup  butter or margarine
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3               cups  water
  3                     chicken bouillon cubes
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz) -- undrained
  1                can  evaporated milk - (12 oz)
  1            package  frozen corn - (10 oz)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  2               cups  shredded Cheddar cheese - (8 oz)
  1              Pinch  granulated sugar -- (optional)
                        Additional chopped parsley -- (optional)

In a Dutch oven or soup kettle over medium heat, saute the zucchini, onion, parsley and basil in butter until vegetables are tender.  Stir in flour, salt and pepper.  Gradually stir in the water.  Add the bouillon and lemon juice; mix well. 
Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes, milk and corn; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until corn is tender. 
Just before serving, stir in cheeses until melted.  Add sugar and garnish with parsley if desired. 
This recipe yields 10 servings (about 2 1/2 quarts). 
Comments:  For a nice fall meal, serve the Zucchini Garden Chowder with a loaf of crusty French bread and sliced fresh pears.  If you still have corn and tomatoes in your garden, use those in the chowder rather than canned and frozen vegetables.
