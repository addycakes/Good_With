  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     ancho chilie - (to 2) -- see * Note
  2              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  dried mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  olive oil - (to 2/3 cup)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  tarragon vinegar
  2        tablespoons  small capers -- rinsed, chopped fine
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped cornichons
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

* Note:  Ripened, dried poblano chilies are sometimes labeled "pasilla."

Remove and discard the stems and seeds from the chilies.  Place them in a bowl and add enough water to cover.  Weight them with a plate so they are completely submerged and let them soak overnight or for at least 6 to 8 hours.  Or, place seeded chilies in boiling water, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Turn off heat and let seep for 20 minutes or until soft.

In a blender or food processor, puree the chilies until smooth.  Add the egg yolks, dry mustard, and salt and blend until smooth.  Add the oil in a steady stream, very slowly at first.  Continue adding the oil until the desired thickness is reached.  Blend in lemon juice and tarragon vinegar.  Place mixture in a bowl and fold in remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate several hours before serving.

Serve with The Lilac Inn's "Crab Cakes" (see recipe).

             Angel Hair Pasta With Shrimp Scampi And Broccoli

Recipe By     :Submitted by Ellis River House, Jackson, NH
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  medium or large shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        rinsed, and patted dry
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  butter - (to 6 tbspns) -- room temperature
  1              bunch  broccoli - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- cut medium
                        flowerets
  9             ounces  fresh angel hair pasta - (to 10 oz)
                        (or 8 oz dried angel hair pasta)

Combine shrimp, garlic, a pinch of salt and pepper, and 4 tablespoons olive oil in medium bowl.  Cover and let marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour or up to 4 hours.  Remove shrimp from marinade and reserve marinade.  Remove garlic pieces adhering to shrimp with a small rubber spatula and return garlic to marinade.

Put 2 to 4 tablespoons butter in a large, warm bowl for tossing with pasta.  Add broccoli to a large saucepan of enough boiling salt water to cover generously.  Cook uncovered over high heat about 5 minutes or until just tender.  Drain broccoli well.  Return to saucepan.  Cover and keep warm.

Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat in a large, heavy skillet.  Add shrimp and saute, tossing often, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until pink on the outside; large shrimp can be white inside when cut.  Reserving fat in skillet, transfer shrimp with a slotted spoon to a large bowl.  Cut some of larger shrimp into thirds.  Cover and keep warm.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add salt, then pasta.  Cook, uncovered, over high heat, separating strands occasionally with a fork, about 2 minutes for fresh or about 8 minutes for dried or until tender but firm to the bite.

Drain well.  Add angel hair to the bowl containing butter pieces and toss well.  Add about 2/3 of shrimp and about 1/2 of broccoli flowerets; toss.

Add shrimp marinade to skillet used to cook shrimp.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, about 1 minute or until garlic is tender but not brown.  Immediately pour mixture over pasta and toss until blended.  Taste and adjust seasoning.

Mound pasta mixture on a large heated platter and encircle with remaining shrimp and broccoli.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4             pounds  spinach -- coarse stems
                        discarded, leaves washed well, spun dry
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === CURRIED HOLLANDAISE ===
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter - (3/4 cup)
  5              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2             dashes  Tabasco pepper sauce -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  curry powder -- or to taste
  20                    oysters -- shucked, reserving
                        the bottom shells

In a large kettle, melt butter over moderately-low heat, in it cook the spinach, covered, stirring occasionally for 15 minutes, or until very tender.  Drain in a colander.  Squeeze out excess liquid from spinach, chop spinach, and season it with the white pepper and salt to taste.  Let spinach cool completely.

Make the curried Hollandaise:  In a small saucepan heat butter over moderate heat until it is melted and foamy, but do not let it brown.  In a blender put yolks, lemon juice, wine, a pinch of salt, and Tabasco and turn machine on and immediately off.  With the machine at low speed, add the butter in a stream.  Cover the blender, increase the speed to high and blend the mixture for 1 minute.  Add curry powder and blend Hollandaise well.

Arrange the reserved oyster shells on a large baking sheet, put an oyster in each shell, and top each one with about 1 tablespoon of spinach.  Bake oysters in the middle of a preheated 450 degree oven for 10 minutes or until heated through.  Top each oyster with 1 tablespoon of the curried Hollandaise and broil oysters under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the tops are browned lightly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  butter
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     green onions -- finely chopped
  1                can  water chestnuts - (6 oz) -- finely chopped
  1              bunch  spinach -- washed, drained,
                        and finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               dash  lemon juice
  24                    wonton wrappers
  24                    oysters -- shucked, drained
                        Oil -- for deep-frying
                        Hot mustard or other dipping sauce -- (my favorite is
                        mango chutney!)

Melt butter in large saute pan.  Saute the garlic, green onions, water chestnuts, spinach, pepper, and lemon juice over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes.

Place about 1 teaspoon of the vegetable mixture in the center of a wonton wrapper, and top with 1 oyster (if the oysters are large, cut them in half).  Bring the lower left corner of the wrapper to the center, followed by the lower right corner and the upper left corner.  Finally, fold the upper right corner on top and seal with a little water.  Continue with the remaining wrappers, oysters, and vegetable mixture.

Place enough oil to just cover the wontons in a large frying pan, and heat it to 375 to 400 degrees.  Deep-fry the filled wontons for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve immediately with hot mustard or the dipping sauce of your choice.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 appetizer servings.

  1                cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped fresh parsley
  4              dozen  cherrystone clams -- shucked, drained,
                        and coarsely chopped
  2                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/3           cup  clam juice -- reserved from clams

                    Butterflied Florida Shrimp Scampi

Recipe By     :Submitted by Grand Harbor Golf & Waterfront Resort Courtyard
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  prawns or large shrimp
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  A-1 steak sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  basil
  1           teaspoon  tarragon
  1           teaspoon  celery salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Butterfly shrimp by peeling shell off all but the tail; cutting 3/4 of the way down the middle, leaving the tail intact and removing vein (or ask butcher to do it).  Wash and drain.  In large heavy skillet, melt butter and add olive oil.  Saute' garlic 30 seconds; add wine and A-1.  Add tarragon, basil, and celery salt, grinding between fingers.

Turn heat to high, and when sauce is bubbling add shrimp with flat sides of tail down.  Turn after three minutes and cook until no longer clear, usually two minutes or less.  Remove individual pieces as they are done.  Add a fair amount of salt and freshly ground pepper.  Serve over rice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe has been in our family for years.  It is usually easy to find fresh shrimp at local markets or at the fishing docks.  The fresher the better.  It is a great entree served with rice as there is plenty of extra tasty sauce.

Caesar salad goes well with it.  The BBQ version is also delicious and is our favorite.  After all ingredients except shrimp are warmed and mixed, pour over shrimp in a mixing bowl.  Take shrimp out after 5 minutes and grill on high heat on BBQ.  Turn after 1 minute and remove when no longer clear.  Heat remaining sauce to a boil and serve as sauce with the rice.

         Cajun Benedict With Andouille Sausage And Crawfish Tails

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Hope & Glory Inn, Irvington, VA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  11                    eggs
  4              dozen  crawfish or crawfish tail meat
  4                     English muffins
  2                     Andouille sausage links - (8" ea)
                        === HOLLANDAISE ===
     1/2         pound  salted sweet cream butter
  3             ounces  white wine
  1                     onion
  1                     red or yellow pepper
  1                     celery stalk
     1/2         ounce  Texas Pete or Tabasco red pepper sauce
     1/2         ounce  lemon juice

Cajun Benedict:  Cook Andouille sausage by baking in oven at 375 degrees for ten minutes each side.  Split down center and cut in half.

Meanwhile, steam crawfish and remove tails for use (save one or two whole for garnish on each plate and save broth for poaching eggs).  Poach 2 eggs for each serving in the remaining broth.

Serve 1 piece of Andouille over one half of toasted English muffin and a dozen or so crawfish tails over the opposite half.  Top each with a poached egg and Creole Hollandaise.

Creole Hollandaise:  Melt 1/2 pound butter in small sauce pot and set aside to cool.  Small dice 1/2 red pepper, celery stalk, and 1/2 onion.  Using a few tablespoons of the melted butter, sweat down (saute) the diced vegetables until softened.

Separate 3 egg yolks into a stainless mixing bowl and add white wine.  Heat over medium flame while whisking rapidly until ribboned.  (In order to keep eggs from scrambling, keep the bowl turning and scape all sides of the bowl as you whisk.  The egg yolk and wine emulsion should not smell scrambled.  On electric cooktops I recommend using a double boiler.  This is slower and safer than direct heat.  Allow the emulsion (sabayon) to cool for a minute or two before proceeding.)

Check the temperature of the melted butter.  To proceed, it should be warm but not hot to the touch, 90 to 110 degrees.  Slowly incorporate the butter in a thin stream while whisking rapidly.  Stir in the vegetables when they are also warm but not hot.  Stir in Texas Pete or Tabasco sauce and lemon juice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  fresh mussels (Penn Cove's are the best)
  1              whole  Walla Walla sweet onion
  1                cup  olive oil
  1               head  garlic
  6                     shakes red wine vinegar
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
                        Oregano -- to taste
                        Basil -- to taste
     1/2         stick  butter
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             bottle  inexpensive white wine

OK, here we go.  Into a large pot or wok, add the oil, garlic, and onion, all minced.  Get it hot and add the spices.  When it's real hot, add the mussels and walk them around until the mussels just begin to open.

Now you can pour in most of the wine (save enough for a glass for yourself), vinegar, and butter.  Put the lid on and steam those little critters for about 3 to 4 minutes.

When they are fully opened, you are ready to serve into bowls (so you can include some broth with each serving).  You'll want some slightly crisp garlic bread to soak up the broth.  That's the way we do it.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is quick, easy and fun.  Perfect for a gathering of about 8 friends on a sunny afternoon. - Capn. Mike

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE CRUST ===
  2               cups  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  8        tablespoons  chilled butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  chilled vegetable shortening -- cut small pieces
  8        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  3             medium  russet potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  2               cups  clam juice
  5                     strips bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1             medium  yellow onion -- peeled, chopped fine
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  3               cups  shucked steamer or cherrystone clams -- roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chilled butter -- cut small pieces

For the pie crust:  Mix together flour, salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl.  Quickly work butter and shortening into flour mixture with the tips of your fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Sprinkle with ice water and stir with a fork until just combined.  Form into a ball, then flatten into a disk and divide in half.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

For the Filling:  Boil potatoes in clam juice in a covered pot over medium heat until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain, lightly mash with a fork, and set aside.

Meanwhile, saute bacon in a skillet over medium-low heat until crisp, about 7 minutes.  Transfer bacon to a paper towel.  Add onions to bacon fat and saute until golden, about 15 minutes.  Mix together bacon, onions, parsley, thyme, clams, flour, and potatoes in a bowl.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface in two 12-inch circles.  Fit 1 circle into a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan.  Add clam filling, mounding in the center.  Top with butter.  Lay remaining dough over filling.  Trim dough, leaving about 1 inch around edge; fold under and crimp two layers together.

Make a little hole in center of pie to allow steam to escape.  Bake until golden, 50 to 55 minutes.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  For this dish, clams may be steamed open (briefly) instead of shucked. (Steaming is easier)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh white bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  half-and-half
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco pepper sauce
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2          teaspoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1              pound  cooked crabmeat
  2                     eggs -- separated
  3        tablespoons  finely-grated horseradish
     3/4           cup  cream sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Clarified butter
                        Lemon wedges

Soak the breadcrumbs in the olive oil and half-and-half.  In a small bowl, combine the mustard, paprika, Tabasco, lemon juice, and pepper; mix thoroughly.  In a large bowl, combine the crabmeat, egg yolks, horseradish, cream sauce, soaked breadcrumbs, salt, and mustard mixture and mix well.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

In a small, dry, clean bowl, whip the egg whites to soft peaks.  Fold them into the crab mixture.  Form the crab mixture into twelve small cakes.

Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle to 350 degrees with just enough clarified butter to film the bottom.  Fry the crabcakes until they are golden brown on each side and heated through, approximately 3 minutes per side.

Serve the crab cakes with "Ancho Chili Remoulade" (see recipe) and garnish with a lemon wedge.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

     1/2         pound  fresh Maine crab meat

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  diced Vidalia onions
  6             ounces  fresh crab meat
  1                     nine-inch pie crust -- partially baked
  1 1/2           cups  grated Swiss cheese
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/8           cups  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  cayenne pepper

Saute onions in butter in a skillet for a few minutes until tender.  Add crab meat and let it heat throughout.  I sprinkle the bottom of the pie shell with Parmesan cheese, then put the crab and onion mixture in the crust.  Then place the grated cheese on top of the crab.

Mix the eggs together with cream, salt, and cayenne pepper.  Slowly pour this mixture over the ingredients in the pie shell.

Bake in the top portion of the oven at 375 degrees for 25 minutes or until done.  It sometimes takes a little longer before the center of the quiche sets up.  Allow it to cool before you cut into slices and serve.  Enjoy!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Seabass or snapper filets
                        Shrimp
                        Huerta Verde's Famous Batter -- (see recipe)
                        Cucumbers -- sliced, and
                        marinated in lime juice
                        Guacamole
                        Red onions -- sliced, and
                        marinated in lime and vinegar
                        Tomatillos mole
                        Radishes -- serve whole
  2                     different salsas (green and red)
                        Cole slaw
                        Sour cream -- if available
                        Flour tortillas

Prepare fish:  Slice into 1 to 1/2-inch strips, cut off all brown parts and skin, so all that is left is nice white filets.  The best fish for this is Seabass (cabrillo) or Snapper filets (pargo).  Seabass is preferred and usually plentiful fresh in the mornings in Mexico.  Dip into Huerta Verde's Famous Batter and fry or deep fat fry.

Prepare shrimp:  Clean and devein shrimp, rinse and drain thoroughly.  Put on ice until ready to cook.  Dip into Huerta Verde's Famous Batter and pan fry or deep fat fry.

Pan fry means 1 inch of shortening or similar cooking oil hot, turn when golden brown.  If cooking oil gets too hot and spatters, put in a pinch of salt.  You will cook filet the same way (pan fry).

Serve to guest their preference; fish or shrimp or both.  Serve on flour tortilla 2 at a time.  Guests can make their own Tacos.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh jumbo sea scallops
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2             ounces  sun-dried tomatoes
  4        tablespoons  minced shallots
  3             ounces  boursin cheese

Julienne the sun-dried tomatoes.  Add olive oil to a hot skillet and saute the shallots and julienned sun-dried tomatoes until shallots are translucent.  Add the heavy cream and boursin cheese.  Add salt and pepper as needed and reduce sauce until thickened, then remove from the heat.

                       Healthy Roux Shrimp Etouffee

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Beach Bungalow, Indialantic by the Sea, FL
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  peeled medium shrimp
  3               cups  seafood stock, clam juice, etc.
  4                     fresh garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
     1/4           cup  chopped green pepper
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         stick  butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped green onions
                        === SEASONING MIX ===
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     chipolte pepper in adobe sauce -- finely chopped,
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried sweet basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme

Peel shrimp and use shells and clam juice to make stock by bringing to a boil in 4 cups of water or clam juice.  Prepare seasoning mix in one bowl, and combine the garlic, onions, celery, and green pepper in another.

In a heavy skillet on saute heat, add the 1 cup of flour and stir continuously while browning.  You'll have to lift the skillet from the heat while stirring to keep from burning the flour, but you'll get the hang of it, and it beats the heck out of high-fat roux.  If at first you burn, try again; it's only flour!  (And the burn flavor will take over the dish.)  Once the flour is dark tan or light brown, set aside in bowl.

In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil and half the seasoning mix to saute, stir in vegetable mix, and cook until tender.  Thoroughly stir in 1/2 cup of flour and then add 2 cups of stock; stir to a boil and set aside.

In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter and half the seasoning mix at saute and add shrimp and green onions.  Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the vegetable mixture and remaining stock and cook 5 minutes until everything is done and flavors have mixed.  Adjust thickness with remaining flour and optional white wine.

Serve over rice with hot fresh bread and lots of beverages.  Louisiana lowfat at its best!

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Peel shrimp and use shells and clam juice to make stock by bringing to a boil in 4 cups of water or clam juice.  Prepare seasoning mix in one bowl, and combine the garlic, onions, celery, and green pepper in another.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a heavy skillet on saute heat, add the 1 cup of flour and stir continuously while browning.  You&apos;ll have to lift the skillet from the heat while stirring to keep from burning the flour, but you&apos;ll get the hang of it, and it beats the heck out of high-fat roux.  If at first you burn, try again; it&apos;s only flour!  (And the burn flavor will take over the dish.)  Once the flour is dark tan or light brown, set aside in bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil and half the seasoning mix to saute, stir in vegetable mix, and cook until tender.  Thoroughly stir in 1/2 cup of flour and then add 2 cups of stock; stir to a boil and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter and half the seasoning mix at saute and add shrimp and green onions.  Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the vegetable mixture and remaining stock and cook 5 minutes until everything is done and flavors have mixed.  Adjust thickness with remaining flour and optional white wine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve over rice with hot fresh bread and lots of beverages.  Louisiana lowfat at its best!
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Clams
                        Olive oil
                        Garlic
                        Dried oregano
                        Lemons
                        White wine

Get as many clams as you can eat.  Clean the shells and put them on ice.  Saute a pile of garlic and dried oregano in olive oil.  Drop in a couple of quartered and squeezed clean lemons with a bit of wine.

Simmer and reduce a bit.  Pour the sauce in the big pot you're using to steam the clams.  Add enough water to reach your steam rack.  Cover, bring to a boil, and load in the clams.  Leave on high and crank it until it boils over, and then turn it off.

A pile of garlic bread, an ice drum full of beverage, get the fools assembled, and uncover the clams and have at 'em.  And remember to pour a cup of the broth for bread dipping.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Steamed and served in seconds.  Our Indian River Lagoon produces 80% of the U.S. cherrystone harvest.  Who knew?  We did, 'cause it's pretty nice knowing clammers, especially when you're planning a barbecue.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lobsters - (abt 2 cups of meat)
  4             medium  red potatoes
  6          teaspoons  butter
     1/2           cup  onion
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  grated carrots
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions
     1/4           cup  chopped leeks
     1/4           cup  chopped red bell pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped green bell pepper
  1                can  evaporated milk
  2               cups  whole milk
  1                cup  sherry
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh parsley sprigs -- for garnish

In a large stock pot or lobster pot, boil lobsters in 2 quarts salted water until done, about 20 minutes.  Discard water.  Allow lobsters to cool.  Remove meat and tamale (the green stuff) from shells.  Save tail and claw shells.

Boil potatoes in 2 cups water until completely cooked and very soft.  Drain and reserve water.  Cut potatoes into quarters.

In a large, non-reactive stock pot, saute 4 teaspoons butter, onion, celery, carrots, scallions, leeks, and bell pepper.  Add evaporated and whole milk, sherry, potatoes, and potato water to pot.  Lower heat to simmer.

Cut lobster meat into pieces.  Saute lobster meat and tamale in 2 teaspoons butter and sesame seeds for 5 minutes.  Add to stew.

Saute shells in same pan for 5 minutes and add to stew.  (The shells will give the stew a roasted flavor.)  Cook at low heat for 1 1/2 hours.

Salt and pepper to taste.  Remove lobster shells and serve in large soup bowls.  Garnish with a sprig of fresh parsley.

Recipe By     :Submitted by Four Columns Inn, Newfane, VT
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     lobsters - (2 lbs ea)
  1               head  cabbage
  12         teaspoons  melted butter
     1/2         pound  butter -- cut into cubes
  4                     shallots -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  white wine
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Plunge the lobsters into a large pot of boiling water for 7 minutes.  Cool under cold running water.  Remove the meat from the shells and cut crossswise into 1/2-inch slices.  Divide into 12 equal portions and reserve.

Take 12 large leaves from the cabbage and blanch them in a pot of salted boiling water until tender.  Drain the leaves and dry flat on towels.  Remove the large central rib from the cabbage leaf.  Place on a work surface and overlap the two sides where the rib was removed to make a continuous surface.

Place the divided lobster on each cabbage leaf.  Fold the cabbage leaf around the lobster to make a packet.  Put the packets folded-side down in a baking dish.  Put 1 teaspoon of melted butter on each packet.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine the wine and shallot in a stainless saucepan and reduce until almost all the liquid has evaporated.  Add the cream and reduce until 1/3 cup remains.  Strain sauce through fine cheesecloth and return to stainless pan.

Cook the cabbage packets in the preheated oven until warm about 5 minutes.  Place the sauce over low heat and whisk in the butter cubes one at a time.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place the cabbage packets on warm plates and surround each packet with sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     lobster tails
                        Diced onion
                        Tomato paste
  1                can  blended whole tomatoes -- drained
                        Minced garlic
                        Thyme
                        Lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  cooking oil

Boil lobster tails.  Cool.  Remove meat from shells.  Cut down center lengthwise.  Break into pieces.  Open pieces up and you will see swirls of meat.  Finely shred out the swirls.  The finer you shred the meat, the fluffier the finished dish will be.  After all meat is shredded, set aside.

Make a sauce of sauteed diced onion, tomato paste, whole tomatoes, minced garlic, thyme, lime juice, salt, and pepper.  Simmer 15 minutes.  Put shredded lobster in sauce and mix thoroughly.  Drizzle 1/4 cup cooking oil over mixture.  Cover and let simmer.  The lobster will absorb the oil and sauce and puff up almost like a souffle.  Serve hot as main dish.

A truly gourmet dish is made by using minced lobster to stuff a whole red snapper.  Bake in oven.  Fit for a king!

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Boil lobster tails.  Cool.  Remove meat from shells.  Cut down center lengthwise.  Break into pieces.  Open pieces up and you will see swirls of meat.  Finely shred out the swirls.  The finer you shred the meat, the fluffier the finished dish will be.  After all meat is shredded, set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make a sauce of sauteed diced onion, tomato paste, whole tomatoes, minced garlic, thyme, lime juice, salt, and pepper.  Simmer 15 minutes.  Put shredded lobster in sauce and mix thoroughly.  Drizzle 1/4 cup cooking oil over mixture.  Cover and let simmer.  The lobster will absorb the oil and sauce and puff up almost like a souffle.  Serve hot as main dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
A truly gourmet dish is made by using minced lobster to stuff a whole red snapper.  Bake in oven.  Fit for a king!

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              dozen  mussels
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  sliced Spanish onion
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  bottled clam juice

Debeard and scrub the mussels.

Heat a large sautÈ pan, place the oil in the pan, and sautÈ the garlic and onions until soft.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine over medium-high heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.

Place the mussels, cream, and clam juice in the pan.  Cover with a second pan (inverted) to create a steamer.  Lower the heat slightly and steam for 5 minutes.  The mussels are done when the shells open and the mussels are firm.

Heap the mussels in a large bowl and pour the broth over them.  Serve with crusty bread for dipping.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The emphasis on gourmet cooking at the Vermont Inn is obvious.

For a lighter version, skim milk may be used in place of the heavy cream.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  mussels -- in shell
  2                     onions -- diced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  white wine
                        Chopped fresh parsley
                        Olive oil
                        Butter or margarine

Clean and beard mussels under water.  In large covered saucepan, saute onions in a mix of half butter or margarine and half oil.  Add black pepper (adjust amount to taste, but this dish is especially good if peppery) and wine.  Bring to a boil, add mussels, and cook, covered, until shells open (a few minutes should suffice; certainly no more than 15!)

Serve in soup bowls, sprinkled with fresh parsley on top.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  I learned this one from a young Parisian doctor who came with his wife to visit me briefly in Sevilla, Spain in 1974 enroute to Morocco, where he was going to do the equivalent of Peace Corps work in lieu of military service.  His recipe has stayed with me ever since and has been raved about at more Super Bowl and other parties than I can remember.

                          Nantucket Shrimp Boil

Recipe By     :Submitted by Nantucket Shell, Nantucket, MA
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  Nantucket Rub -- see * Note
  2             quarts  Whale's Tale Pale Ale
  1                     lemon -- quartered
  4             pounds  shrimp - (16/20 count) -- unpeeled

* Note:  A local comercially prepared blend of dill, pink peppercorns, tarragon and lemon peel available from http://www.completekitchen.com/

Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pot.  Add the Nantucket Rub and cook until the seasoning smells aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes.  Pour in the beer and add the lemon quarters.  Bring the mixture to a boil.

Using a drop-in steamer basket with a handle, add the shrimp to the pot and simmer until just cooked through the centers, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the steamer basket from the pot, holding it over the pot briefly to drain all liquid.

Mound the hot shrimp onto a platter and have your dipping sauce-of-choice ready.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A peel-n-eat shrimp feast is something you don't see much of anymore except in states that border the Gulf of Mexico.  However, such a meal can be loads of fun and offer a nice change of pace from the traditional New England boiled lobster dinner.  The boil is given a distinctive Nantucket twist by cooking the shrimp in a combination of Cisco Brewery's Whale's Tale Pale Ale and Nantucket Rub.  Place a heaped communal platter of the hot boiled shrimp in the center of a table spread with last week's Inquirer & Mirror.  Have lots of napkins and icy beer on hand.  The choice of dipping sauce is up to you -- melted butter, extra virgin olive oil, cocktail sauce, homemade mayonnaise, or other favorite seafood sauce.

                         Onset Bay Quahog Chowder

Recipe By     :Submitted by Zachariah Eddy House Bed & Breakfast, Middlebor
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              dozen  large fresh quahogs (hard shelled clams) -- shucked, with
                        liquid reserved
  1              stick  butter
  2                     onions -- chopped
  6                     potatoes - (to 8) -- peeled
     1/2           cup  flour
  1              quart  light cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley

In a large skillet, melt butter.  Add onions and saute until cooked but not browned.

Meanwhile cut potatoes into bite-sized pieces for chowder.  Cook for 10 minutes in boiling water.  Do not overcook or they will fall apart in chowder.  Drain immediately and set aside.

When onion is cooked add flour and blend in well with wire whisk.  Continue cooking for two to three minutes longer.

Cut clam meat into small pieces.  Strain clam liquid with fine strainer to be sure there are no shells, and pour gradually into butter and flour mixture, stirring constantly.  Add the clam pieces and continue to cook over low heat for about 10 more minutes, long enough to cook the clams.

Gradually add cream to roux (butter & flour mixture), stirring constantly.  Heat through over low heat, being careful not to boil.  Add salt, pepper and parsley to taste, then add the potatoes and serve.

Chowder will be thick.  If a thinner consistency is desired add more cream or milk.  Although milk will thin more easily than cream, it will curdle if chowder should get by you and come to a boil.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The flavor of chowder made with fresh quahogs (hard shelled clams) cannot be duplicated with canned ingredients or bottled broth!

At your local fish market or supermarket, but about 2 dozen large fresh quahogs and shuck (be sure to save all liquid for this is the key to the flavor).  The faint of heart can substitute fresh chopped clams in their own juice.  You need at least one full quart and even as much as two.  The more clams and natural juices, the more flavor.

In a large skillet, melt butter.  Add onions and saute until cooked but not browned.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile cut potatoes into bite-sized pieces for chowder.  Cook for 10 minutes in boiling water.  Do not overcook or they will fall apart in chowder.  Drain immediately and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When onion is cooked add flour and blend in well with wire whisk.  Continue cooking for two to three minutes longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut clam meat into small pieces.  Strain clam liquid with fine strainer to be sure there are no shells, and pour gradually into butter and flour mixture, stirring constantly.  Add the clam pieces and continue to cook over low heat for about 10 more minutes, long enough to cook the clams.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gradually add cream to roux (butter &amp; flour mixture), stirring constantly.  Heat through over low heat, being careful not to boil.  Add salt, pepper and parsley to taste, then add the potatoes and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chowder will be thick.  If a thinner consistency is desired add more cream or milk.  Although milk will thin more easily than cream, it will curdle if chowder should get by you and come to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields ?? servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The flavor of chowder made with fresh quahogs (hard shelled clams) cannot be duplicated with canned ingredients or bottled broth!
</DirT>
<DirT>
At your local fish market or supermarket, but about 2 dozen large fresh quahogs and shuck (be sure to save all liquid for this is the key to the flavor).  The faint of heart can substitute fresh chopped clams in their own juice.  You need at least one full quart and even as much as two.  The more clams and natural juices, the more flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh medium-size oysters
  3                     eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  fine bread crumbs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  4          teaspoons  water
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === COCKTAIL SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  catsup
  1         tablespoon  horseradish
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire

Heat oil in large cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium heat.  Mix flour, salt and pepper.  Mix eggs and water.  Dip each oyster in flour then egg/water mixture, then bread crumbs before putting in skillet.

Cook approximately 3 minutes per side.  Oysters should be medium-brown color.  Turn only once.  Serve hot with cocktail sauce.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This recipe came from one of our neighbors in Central Oregon.  It is great with local Oregon oysters you can buy at any of the oyster farms along the Oregon Coast.  We often make the trip just to pick up a variety of fresh seafood such as Dungeness crab, Pacific clams and fish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  butter
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  6                     eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1               dash  salt
  1               dash  Tabasco pepper sauce
  1 1/3           cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sherry
  2               cups  coarsely-flaked imitation crab meat

Butter a 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking pan.

For omelet, in a heavy medium saucepan, melt 3/4 cup butter.  Stir in the 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg.  Add milk.  Cook and stir over medium-heat until mixture follows the spoon around the saucepan.  Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes.

Add eggs, one at a time, beating with a wire whisk until combined.  Spread egg mixture in the prepared baking pan.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until the omelet is puffy and golden.

Meanwhile, for filling, in a heavy saucepan melt the 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in the 2 tablespoons flour, dash salt, and Tabasco sauce.  Add the whipping cream all at once.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Add sherry, then cook and stir for one minute more.  Stir in the crab meat.  Cook just till heated through.  Set filling aside.

Line a flat surface with a large sheet of waxed paper.  When the omelet is done, immediately loosen it from the pan and invert the omelet onto the sheet of waxed paper.  Spread omelet with filling.  Roll up omelet without the waxed paper, jelly-roll style, starting from the short sides.

Transfer crab roll to a serving platter, seam-side down.  Serve topped with cheese sauce or with cheese sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  If you have a little extra time to spend on breakfast in the morning, this is a very special treat for your family or overnight guests.

Comments:  As a guest you will feel especially privileged for Ruth is an expert in open hearth cooking and her meals are reminiscent of actual Colonial offerings.  "When you're doing hearth cooking, you don't just open your oven door to look at the food; you get inside it -- literally," explains Ruth.  "You don't just turn on a burner; you create them by the way you build the fire and bank the burning coals."

                         Scallops Alla Veneziana

Recipe By     :Submitted by Tucker Hill Lodge, Waitsfield, VT
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh sea scallops
  1              large  onion -- sliced thin
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
  4        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  half-and-half
                        Salt -- to taste

Saute the sliced onions and the scallops in the butter over medium heat until golden brown.  Add flour and mix.  Add half-and-half, raisins, and pine nuts.  Salt to taste.  Lower heat and simmer until reduced by half.

Serve with polenta (we let ours chill overnight, then fry it in a little butter and top with grated cheese) and pepperonata (stewed tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is one of our guest's favorite dishes.  It was taught to us by Giorgio's mother who was born and raised in the hills outside of Venice.  The classic recipe actually calls for bacala or dried salted cod but we have substituted scallops which we find are more appealing to the American palate.

  4              large  boneless skinless chicken breasts
  12            medium  to large shrimp
                        Italian salad dressing
                        Butter
                        Lemon juice
  3             medium  fresh garlic cloves
                        Capers -- (optional)
                        Lettuce leaves -- for serving
                        Fresh cut lemon -- for serving
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Pound out chicken breasts and cut into strips to make chicken tenders.  Peel and devein uncooked shrimp.  Wrap individual chicken strips around shrimp and hold with toothpicks.  Marinate shrimp wrapped in chicken in Italian salad dressing overnight.

Saute butter, finely chopped garlic, and lemon juice (and capers, if using).  Add shrimp/chicken and sear on high heat, constantly turning the shrimp.  Transfer to grill and finish cooking.  Arrange on a bed of lettuce and fresh cut lemon and sprinkle with fresh parsley.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is a wonderful and impressive appetizer that we made many times in the restaurant at Las Bahias Resort on Vieques, Puerto Rico, where we both worked one winter.  It was a huge success!  In fact, many non-chicken lovers will be tempted to tell you this is the first time they have truly enjoyed chicken -- keep your fingers crossed, they may even go so far as to tell you they love it!

Comments:  This is a wonderful and impressive appetizer that we made many times in the restaurant at Las Bahias Resort on Vieques, Puerto Rico, where we both worked one winter.  It was a huge success!  In fact, many non-chicken lovers will be tempted to tell you this is the first time they have truly enjoyed chicken -- keep your fingers crossed, they may even go so far as to tell you they love it!

                 Steamed Mussels With Aromatic Vegetables

Recipe By     :Submitted by Carter House Victorians, Eureka, CA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  minced sweet onion
     1/2           cup  minced fennel bulb
  1              large  carrot -- minced
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1                     bay leaf -- see * Note
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  4               cups  very fresh mussels -- scrubbed, cleaned
  2 1/2           cups  dry white vermouth

* Note:  Wipe both sides of leaf with a paper towel before using to remove oxidized oils and release fresh essence.

In large kettle or deep saute pan, melt butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, fennel and carrot, and cook until the onion and fennel are translucent.  Add the shallot and cook another 30 seconds.  Add the parsley, bay leaf and mussels, stir to incorporate the ingredients.  Add the wine, stir again.  Cover the pan tightly and raise the heat to high.  Let the mussels steam for four minutes.  Uncover the pan and discard any mussels that haven't opened.

Divide the mussels between four warmed serving bowls and pour some of the poaching liqueur over each, being careful not to use the last liquid at the bottom of the pan, which may contain some sand.  Serve with crusty rounds of French or Italian bread for dipping in the sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Mussels are extremely perishable and should never be kept for more than a day or two before serving.  Buy only mussels with the shells tightly closed.  Test the mussels for freshness by lightly tapping the shell -- the mussel should open slightly if it is alive, and have a slightly sweet-briny aroma, never fishy.  After purchasing, rinse the mussels, and store them on ice in the refrigerator, covered with a damp towel.  Before steaming the mussels, scrape off the beards protruding from the shell and scrub with a vegetable brush under cold running water for three minutes.  Always buy cultivated mussels from a reliable source -- if in doubt, ask to see the packaging tag.  Another good pointer when buying any seafood is to check the temperature in the display case.  The safe zone is between 33 and 40 degrees.  Any reputable fish monger will display a thermometer prominently in the refrigerator.  Most important of all, if you detect a noticeable fishy odor when entering your fish market, find another source for seafood.

Divide the mussels between four warmed serving bowls and pour some of the poaching liqueur over each, being careful not to use the last liquid at the bottom of the pan, which may contain some sand.  Serve with crusty rounds of French or Italian bread for dipping in the sauce.

Comments:  Mussels are extremely perishable and should never be kept for more than a day or two before serving.  Buy only mussels with the shells tightly closed.  Test the mussels for freshness by lightly tapping the shell -- the mussel should open slightly if it is alive, and have a slightly sweet-briny aroma, never fishy.  After purchasing, rinse the mussels, and store them on ice in the refrigerator, covered with a damp towel.  Before steaming the mussels, scrape off the beards protruding from the shell and scrub with a vegetable brush under cold running water for three minutes.  Always buy cultivated mussels from a reliable source -- if in doubt, ask to see the packaging tag.  Another good pointer when buying any seafood is to check the temperature in the display case.  The safe zone is between 33 and 40 degrees.  Any reputable fish monger will display a thermometer prominently in the refrigerator.  Most important of all, if you detect a noticeable fishy odor when entering your fish market, find another source for seafood.
