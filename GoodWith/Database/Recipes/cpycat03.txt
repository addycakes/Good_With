Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  2        tablespoons  light butter
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  fat-free mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  Grey Poupon Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  honey
  1         tablespoon  prepared mustard
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
     1/8      teaspoon  paprika
                        === CHICKEN MARINADE ===
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === CAJUN SPICE BLEND ===
     1/2    tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  8               cups  chopped iceberg lettuce
     1/2           cup  shredded red cabbage
     1/2           cup  shredded carrot
     1/2           cup  shredded fat-free mozzarella cheese
     1/2           cup  shredded fat-free cheddar cheese
  1              large  tomato -- diced
  1                     hard-boiled egg white -- diced

Make dressing by combining ingredients in a small bowl.  Mix well by hand.  Store in a covered container in the refrigerator until salad is ready. 
Combine water, lime juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire in a medium bowl, and stir.  Add the chicken breasts to the marinade, cover bowl and keep in refrigerator for several hours.  Overnight is even better. 
When chicken is marinated, preheat a frying pan or skillet (an iron skillet, if youÃ­ve got it) over medium-high heat.  Also, preheat your barbecue grill to medium-high heat. 
Combine the spices for the Cajun Spice Blend in a small bowl.  Sprinkle a teaspoon of the spice blend over one side of each of the chicken breasts.  Cover the entire surface of the chicken with spice. 
Melt the butter in the hot pan, then sear the chicken breasts for 2 to 3 minutes on the side with the spices.  While first side cooks, sprinkle another teaspoon of spice over the top of each chicken breast, coating that side as you did the other.  Flip the chicken over, and sear for another 2 to 3 minutes.  The surface of the chicken will be coated with a charred, black layer of flavor.  This is exactly what you are shooting for. 
Finish the chicken off on your barbecue grill.  Grill each breast on both sides for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are done. 
While chicken is cooking prepare the salads by splitting the lettuce into two large bowls.  Toss in the red cabbage and carrots.  Mix the cheeses together, then top the salad with the cheeses and hard-boiled egg.  Sprinkle the diced tomato on each salad. 
Slice the chicken breast, across each breast in 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Spread the chicken over the top of the salad and serve immediately with dressing on the side. 
This recipe yields 2 entree servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORIENTAL DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  honey
  1 1/2    tablespoons  rice wine vinegar

  1           teaspoon  Grey Poupon Dijon mustard

                        === SALAD ===
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  corn flake crumbs
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     boneless skinless chicken breast half
  2               cups  vegetable oil - (to 4 cups) -- for frying
  3               cups  chopped romaine lettuce
  1                cup  red cabbage
  1                cup  Napa cabbage
     1/2                carrot -- julienned or shredded
  1                     green onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sliced almonds
     1/3           cup  chow mein noodles

Preheat oil in deep fryer or deep pan over medium heat.  You want the temperature of the oil to be around 350 degrees. 
Blend together all ingredients for dressing in a small bowl with an electric mixer.  Put dressing in refrigerator to chill while you prepare the salad.

Cut chicken breast into 4 or 5 long strips.  Dip each strip of chicken first into egg mixture then into the flour mixture, coating each piece completely.  Fry each chicken finger for 5 minutes or until coating has darkened to brown. 
Prepare salad by tossing the chopped romaine with the chopped red cabbage, Napa cabbage, and carrots.  Sprinkle sliced green onion on top of the lettuce.  Sprinkle almonds over the salad, then the chow mein noodles. 
Cut the chicken into small bite-size chunks.  Place the chicken onto the salad forming a pile in the middle.  Serve with salad dressing on the side. 
This recipe yields 1 dinner-size salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  cooked converted or parboiled rice
                        (1 cup uncooked rice)
  1                cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated carrot
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  diced onion - (1/2 small onion)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook rice following instructions on package.  (Bring 2 cups water to a boil, add rice and a dash of salt, reduce heat and simmer in covered saucepan for 20 minutes).  Pour rice into a large bowl to let it cool in the refrigerator. 
Scramble the eggs in a small pan over medium heat.  Separate the scrambled chunks of egg into small pea-size bits while cooking. 
When rice has cooled to near room temperature, add peas, grated carrot, scrambled egg and diced onion to the bowl.  Carefully toss all of the ingredients together. 
Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.  When butter has completely melted, dump the bowl of rice and other ingredients into the pan and add soy sauce plus a dash of salt and pepper.  Cook rice for 6 to 8 minutes over heat, stirring often. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  tomato sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Kraft original barbecue sauce
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1 1/2         pounds  ground sirloin (10% fat)
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               dash  garlic powder

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
Combine the tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture until it begins to bubble, stirring often, then remove it from the heat. 
In a large bowl, add all but 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the meat.  Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to work the sauce into the meat until it is very well combined.  Combine the remaining ingredients with the ground sirloin -- flour, salt, onion powder and ground pepper.  Use the wooden spoon or your hands to work the spices and flour into the meat. 
Load the meat into a loaf pan (preferably a meatloaf pan with two sections which allows the fat to drain, but if you don't have one of those a regular loaf pan will work).  Wrap foil over the pan and place it into the oven for 30 minutes. 
After 30 minutes, take the meatloaf from the oven, remove the foil and, if you aren't using a meatloaf pan, drain the fat.  Using a knife, slice the meatloaf all the way through into 8 slices while it is still in the pan. This will help to cook the center of the meatloaf. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of sauce over the top of the meatloaf, in a stream down the center.  Don't spread the sauce. 
Place the meatloaf back into the oven, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until it is done.  Remove and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     sesame seed hamburger buns
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  1               dash  salt

  8             slices  American cheese
  1 1/3           cups  chopped lettuce
  1              slice  white onion - (to 2 slices) -- separated
  8                     dill pickle slices
                        === SPREAD ===
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  French dressing
  2          teaspoons  sweet pickle relish
  1           teaspoon  white vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Divide the ground beef into 8 even portions (3 ounces each).  Roll each portion into a ball, then press each ball flat to form a patty about the same diameter as the bun. 
Grill the beef patties for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until done.  Lightly salt and pepper each side of the patties. 
As the meat cooks, brown the faces of the buns in a hot skillet, toaster oven or face-down on the grill.  Watch the buns closely so that they do not burn. 
Build each burger by first spreading a tablespoon of the spread on the face of the top bun.  Arrange about 1/3 cup of lettuce evenly over the spread. 
On the bottom bun stack a patty, then a slice of American cheese, another patty, and another slice of cheese.  On the top slice of cheese arrange 2 to 3 separated onion slices (rings), then 2 pickle slices. 
Turn the top part of the burger over onto the bottom and serve.  You may also want to zap the sandwiches in the microwave, individually, for 15 to 20 seconds each. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chicken breast fillets
  4                     sesame seed hamburger buns
  1 1/3           cups  chopped lettuce
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  8                     tomato slices
                        === MARINADE ===
     3/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  liquid smoke
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  oregano
  1               dash  onion powder
  1               dash  parsley

Make the marinade by combining the ingredients in a medium bowl. 
Prepare the chicken by cutting each breast in half.  Fold a piece of plastic wrap around each piece of chicken and pound the meat with a tenderizing mallet until it is about 1/4-inch thick and about the same diameter as the hamburger buns.  Place the chicken into the marinade, cover it, and chill for at least four hours.  Overnight is even better. 
Preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to high heat.  Grill the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until done.  Toast the faces of the hamburger buns in a pan or griddle, in a toaster over, or face-down on the grill.  Watch the buns closely to be certain that the faces turn only light brown and do not burn. 
Build each sandwich from the top down by first spreading about a tablespoon of the mayonnaise on the toasted face of a top bun.  Spread about 1/3 cup of chopped lettuce over the mayonnaise.  Arrange two tomato slices on the lettuce. 
Place a chicken breast on the toasted face of the bottom bun.  Flip the top part of the sandwich over onto the bottom and scarf out. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dry spinach fettuccine
                        (or 2 lbs fresh fettuccine)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro -- (2 tbspns reserved
                        for garnish/finish)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced jalapeÃo pepper
                        (seeds and veins may be eliminated
                        if milder flavor is desired)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
     1/2           cup  chicken stock (preferably homemade)
  2        tablespoons  gold tequila
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/4         pounds  chicken breast -- cut 3/4" dice
     1/4        medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2        medium  red bell pepper -- thinly sliced
     1/2        medium  yellow bell pepper -- thinly sliced
     1/2        medium  green bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream

Prepare rapidly boiling, salted water to cook pasta; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes for dry pasta, approximately 3 minutes for fresh.  Pasta may be cooked slightly ahead of time, rinsed and oiled and then "flashed" (reheated) in boiling water or cooked to coincide with the finishing of the sauce/topping. 
Cook 1/3 cup cilantro, garlic and jalapeno in 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes.  Add stock, tequila and lime juice.  Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until reduced to a paste like consistency; set aside. 
Pour soy sauce over diced chicken; set aside for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile cook onion and peppers, stirring occasionally, with remaining butter over medium heat.  When the vegetables have wilted (become limp), add chicken and soy sauce; toss and add reserved tequila/lime paste and cream. 
Bring the sauce to a boil; boil gently until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick (about 3 minutes).  When sauce is done, toss with well-drained spinach fettuccine and reserved cilantro. 
Serve family-style or transfer to serving dishes, evenly distributing chicken and vegetables. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN PIECES ===
  36            pieces  boneless skinless chicken breasts in 1/4"
                        cubes
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  favorite BBQ sauce
                        (we use a spicy-sweet sauce)
                        === FOR THE PIZZA ===
                        Basic pizza dough for 2 pizzas
                        (or 2 prepared pizza crusts)
                        cornmeal, semolina or flour -- for handling
     1/2           cup  favorite BBQ sauce
                        (we use a spicy-sweet sauce)
  2        tablespoons  shredded smoked Gouda cheese
  2               cups  shredded mozzarella cheese
     1/4           cup  small red-onion in 1/8" sliced pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

To make the BBQ Chicken:  In a large frying pan, cook the chicken in olive oil over medium-high heat until just cooked, 5 to 6 minutes.  Do not overcook.  Set aside in the refrigerator until chilled through.  Once chilled, coat the chicken with two tablespoons BBQ sauce; set aside in the refrigerator. 
To make the pizza:  Place a pizza stone in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees for one hour before cooking pizzas. 
Use a large spoon to spread 1/4 cup BBQ sauce evenly over the surface of the prepared dough within the rim.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon smoked Gouda cheese over the sauce.  Cover with 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella. 
Distribute half the chicken pieces evenly over the cheese (approximately 18 pieces).  Place approximately 18 to 20 pieces of red onion over the surface.  Sprinkle an additional 1/4 cup mozzarella over the top of the pizza. 
Transfer the pizza to the oven; bake until the crust is crisp and golden and the cheese at the center is bubbly (about 8 to 10 minutes).  When the pizza is cooked, carefully remove it from the oven; sprinkle 1 tablespoon cilantro over the hot surface.  Slice and serve. 
Repeat with the remaining ingredients for a second pizza.  (The two pizzas may be prepared simultaneously if you are careful in placing the pizzas at opposite corners of your pizza stone.) 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  Olive Oil
  1 1/2                 seven-inch corn tortillas -- cut into 1" squares
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced white onion
  1 1/2       teaspoon  minced jalapeÃo pepper
  1              pound  white corn kernels
  1 1/2         pounds  ripe red Tomatoes -- chopped
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
  2 1/2      teaspoons  ground Cumin
  1        tablespoons  Kosher salt
     1/8     teaspoons  freshly-ground White Pepper
     1/2     teaspoons  chili powder
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1              quart  chicken stock
  24                    blue corn tortilla chips -- (optional garnish)
  2               cups  shredded cheddar cheese -- (optional garnish)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro -- (optional garnish)

Over medium-high heat, fry tortilla squares in olive oil until they begin to crisp and turn a golden yellow.  Add garlic, onion and jalapeÃo; cook 1 to 2 minutes, until onion becomes translucent.  Add half the corn along with all other ingredients (except garnishes), reserving other half of corn to be added at the end. 
Bring the soup to a low, even boil.  Boil for 5 minutes.  Remove soup from heat.  Use a hand-held propeller blade processor to process in batches to the consistency of a course puree.  You can also process in batches in a blender. 
Return the soup to the burner and add the reserved corn.  Bring the soup to a boil once again being extremely careful to avoid scorching or burning the soup.  Serve, garnished with blue corn tortilla chips, cilantro and sharp cheddar cheese. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     prepared onion
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  McCormick Season All
     1/2     teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4     teaspoons  garlic powder
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  catsup
     1/2     teaspoons  McCormick Season All
     1/8     teaspoons  red pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated fresh horseradish
     1/4     teaspoons  paprika

Mix all dry ingredients together.  Onion may be sliced like a blossom by cutting the top 1/4th off, the top has the stem.  Then peel and be very careful to leave the root intact.  Carefully slice from the top of the onion down but stop about 1/2 inch before you get to the root, taking care not to cut through the root.  Slice the rest of the onion like a pie into many servings.  When complete, soak onion in ice-cold water for 1/2 hour so the onion's petals will start to open up and bloom. 
Drain onion and dip in flour mixture and dust well.  Dip onion then in buttermilk and back in flour mixture.  Place in hot oil and fry until golden.  Oil should cover onion.  When done, drain well and place on plate and cut center out of onion so the petals may easily be removed. 
Dipping Sauce:  Mix all together and serve in the middle of the onion blossom.  Garnish with paprika and just a dash of red pepper. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Chicken
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  1                     egg
  1                cup  milk
  2                     chicken breast fillets
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- (4 to 6)
     1/4           cup  Crystal or Frank's Louisiana hot sauce
  1         tablespoon  margarine
                        ==== ON THE SIDE ===
                        bleu cheese dressing -- for dipping
                        celery sticks

Combine flour, salt, peppers and paprika in a medium bowl.  In another small bowl, whisk together egg and milk. 
Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces.  Preheat 4 to 6 cups of vegetable oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees. 
One or two at a time, dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, then into the breading blend; then repeat the process so that each piece of chicken is double-coated.  When all chicken pieces have been breaded, arrange them on a plate and chill for 15 minutes. 
When the chicken is done resting, drop each piece into the hot oil and fry for 5 to 6 minutes or until each piece is browned. 
As chicken fries, combine the hot sauce and margarine in a small bowl.  Microwave sauce for 20 to 30 seconds or just until the margarine is melted, then stir to combine.  You can also use a small saucepan for this step.  Just combine the hot sauce and margarine in the saucepan over low heat and stir until margarine is melted and ingredients are blended. 
When chicken pieces are done frying, remove them to a plate lined with a couple paper towels.  Place the chicken pieces into a covered container such as a large jar with a lid.  Pour the sauce over the chicken in the container, cover, and then shake gently until each piece of chicken is coated with sauce. 
Pour the chicken onto a plate and serve the dish with bleu cheese dressing and sliced celery on the side. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 appetizer servings.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PICO DE GALLO ===
  2             medium  tomatoes -- diced
     1/2           cup  diced Spanish onion
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh jalapeno pepper -- seeded, de-ribbed
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced fresh cilantro
  1              pinch  salt
                        === GUACAMOLE ===
  2              small  or 1 large Haas avocado
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
     1/4           cup  diced tomato
     1/2      teaspoon  diced jalapeno
     1/4      teaspoon  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === CHILI QUESO ===
  3             ounces  ground beef
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                jar  Cheez Whiz - (16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
                        === SANDWICH ===
  2             pounds  ground beef
  4              large  sesame seed buns
  2               cups  iceberg lettuce -- shredded or
                        chopped thin
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1                     green onion -- chopped
  16                    tortilla chips - (to 20)
  2                     fresh jalapenos - (to 3) -- sliced

First make the pico de gallo.  This is easy.  Just combine all of the ingredients for the pico in a small bowl and mix well.  Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator. 
Now we'll make the guacamole.  In a small bowl, smash up most of the avocado, but be sure to leave several unsmashed chunks.  Add the remaining ingredients for the guacamole to the avocado and mix well.  Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator, next to the pico. 
Next we'll make the chili queso.  In yet another small bowl, mix together ground beef, flour, a pinch of salt, a pinch of black pepper, and a pinch of chili powder.  Use your hands to work the dry ingredients into the ground beef.  Brown the beef in a small skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Use a spoon or spatula to crumble the beef as it cooks.  Cook until it's brown, then set aside. 
Melt the Cheez Whiz with 2 tablespoons of milk over low heat.  When milk and cheese has been combined, add the remaining queso ingredients.  Heat while stirring often until cheese is smooth and creamy, then cover saucepan and remove it from the heat. 
Pre-heat a griddle or large frying pan over medium heat.  Lightly butter the face of each bun and brown the buns face-down on the heat. 
Separate the ground beef into four 1/2-pound portions.  Roll each portion of meat into a ball and then pat the meat down into a circular patty slightly larger in diameter than the hamburger buns.  Cook the hamburger patties for 5 to 10 minutes per side, until done.  Lightly salt and pepper each burger patty. 
Build the burger open-faced in the following order starting with the bottom bun:  On Bottom Bun - 1/2 cup shredded lettuce - hamburger patty - 2 tablespoons chili queso - 4 or 5 crumbled tortilla chips - 2 teaspoons green onion. 
On Top Bun - 1/2 tablespoon mayonnaise - 2 tablespoons pico de gallo - 2 tablespoons guacamole - 4 jalapeno slices. 
Serve burger with extra queso and guacamole.  May also serve french fries on the side and use the chili queso for dipping. 
This recipe yields 4 burgers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar -- divided
  1                cup  warmed milk
     2/3           cup  butter
  2           teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
  7               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 8 cups) -- or more if needed
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  melted butter -- divided
  1 3/4           cups  granulated sugar -- divided
  3        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2           cups  chopped walnuts -- (optional)
  1 1/2           cups  raisins -- (optional)
                        === CREAMY GLAZE ===
     2/3           cup  melted butter
  4               cups  powdered sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  4        tablespoons  hot water - (to 8 tbspns)

In a small bowl mix together warm water, yeast and sugar and set aside.  In a large bowl, mix milk, remaining 2/3 cup sugar, melted butter, salt and eggs; stir well and add yeast mixture.  Add half the flour and beat until smooth.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour until dough is slightly stiff (dough will be sticky). 
Turn out onto a well-floured board; knead 5 to 10 minutes.  Place in well-buttered glass or plastic bowl, cover and let rise in warm place, free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 
When doubled, punch down dough and let rest 5 minutes.  Roll out on floured surface into a 15- by 20-inch rectangle. 
To prepare filling:  Spread dough with 1/2 cup melted butter.  Mix together 1 1/2 cups sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over buttered dough.  Sprinkle with walnuts and raisins, if desired. 
Roll up jellyroll-fashion and pinch edge together to seal.  Cut into 12 to 15 slices.  Coat bottom of a 13- by 9-inch baking pan and a 8-inch square pan with remaining 1/2 cup melted butter, then sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar.  Place cinnamon roll slices close together in pans.  Let rise in warm place until dough is doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until rolls are nicely browned.  Cool rolls slightly. 
To prepare glaze:  Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix melted butter, powdered sugar and vanilla; add hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until glaze reaches desired spreading consistency.  Spread over slightly cooled rolls. 
This recipe yields 12 large rolls.

NOTES : Cracker Barrel does not use sour cream, you might want to try some chicken broth to bind everything together.  I would keep two cans in mind, starting with one, and then trying another.  You would also want to use the shredded and not the cubed hash browns.  Oh yes, I would also omit the cream of chicken soup.  I would add just enough broth to make sure everything is moistened, but do not soak the potatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  Russet potatoes
  4        tablespoons  margarine (yes margarine
                        do not use "spread")
     1/4           cup  milk - (to 1/2 cup)
  1          teaspoons  salt
     1/2     teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper

Wash potatoes thoroughly, cut into uniform pieces, and drop into salted boiling water.  Cook potatoes until they are fork tender.  Take potatoes out of boiling water and drain.  Peel most of the potatoes, make sure you leave about one fifth of the area not peeled. 
Place potatoes into bowl with other ingredients and mash the potatoes.  I would not use an electric mixer, you do not want to take all of the lumps out, if you do, just be careful not to totally mash the potatoes. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  shortening
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  marshmallow creme -1 7-oz jar)
  1                cup  shortening
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  very hot water

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
In a medium bowl, blend together the egg, shortening and sugar with an electric mixer.  Continue beating while adding the milk and vanilla.  In another bowl sift together remaining ingredients -- flour, cocoa, salt and baking powder.  Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients and beat until smooth. 
Spoon about a tablespoon of the batter in strips about 4 inches long and 1 inch wide on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cakes are done.  Cool. 
In another bowl combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar and vanilla.  Dissolve the 1/8 teaspoon of salt in the 2 teaspoons of very hot water in a small bowl.  Add this salt solution to the filling mixture and beat on high speed with an electric mixer until the filling is smooth and fluffy. 
When the cakes have cooled, spread about a tablespoon of filling on the face of one cake and top it off with another cake.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients. 
This recipe yields 20 to 24 snack cakes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               bags  Nestle Mint Chocolate Morsels - (10 oz ea)
  6        tablespoons  shortening
  108                   chocolate wafers (from TSR's improved
                        version of Nabisco Oreo) -- see recipe

Combine mint chocolate chips with shortening in a large microwave safe glass or ceramic bowl.  Heat on 50% power for 2 minutes, stir (with a plastic or wooden spoon), then heat for an additional minute.  Stir once again, and if chocolate is not a smooth consistency, continue to zap in microwave in 30 second intervals until smooth. 
Use a fork to dip each wafer in the chocolate, tap the fork on the edge of the bowl so that the excess chocolate runs off, and then place the cookies side-by-side on a wax paper-lined baking sheet.  Refrigerate until firm. 
This recipe yields 108 cookies.

NOTES : Tidbits - This recipe was designed to use all of the chocolate cookie wafers from the TSR improved version of Nabisco Oreos.  However, if you only want to make the equivalent of one box of Thin Mints, or 36 cookies, simply reduce the ingredients to 1/3 of what's listed.  In other words, one bag of mint chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of shortening will cover 36 chocolate wafers.

NOTES : You can also smoke your pork in a charcoal barbecue, such as a round Weber Grill.  Just arrange the charcoal around the edge of the inside of the grill.  When the coals are hot, place the soaked wood chips on them, and then place the pork on the center of the rack above the coals.  Cover.  Cook the meat for 2 to 4 hours or until the internal temperature comes to 150 to 165 degrees.

<Note>
You can also smoke your pork in a charcoal barbecue, such as a round Weber Grill.  Just arrange the charcoal around the edge of the inside of the grill.  When the coals are hot, place the soaked wood chips on them, and then place the pork on the center of the rack above the coals.  Cover.  Cook the meat for 2 to 4 hours or until the internal temperature comes to 150 to 165 degrees.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  water
  2               cups  uncooked elbow macaroni
     1/3           cup  shredded cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  Cheez Whiz
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Bring 8 cups (2 quarts) of water to a boil over high heat in a large saucepan.  Add elbow macaroni to water and cook for 10 to 12 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. 
As macaroni boils, prepare sauce by combining cheddar cheese, Cheez Whiz, and milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir cheese mixture often as it heats, so that it does not burn.  Add salt.  When all of the cheddar cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth, cover pan and set aside until macaroni is ready. 
When macaroni is ready, strain water, but do not rinse the macaroni.  Using the same pan you prepared the macaroni in, combine the macaroni with the cheese sauce, and mix well. 
This recipe yields 4 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  mayonnaise
     1/2      teaspoon  brown mustard
                        (French's "Hearty Deli" is good)
  1                     sesame seed hamburger bun
     1/4         pound  ground beef
  1              slice  American cheese
  1                     tomato slice - (to 2)
  1                     lettuce leave - (to 2) -- chopped
     1/2    tablespoon  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion

In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and the brown mustard.  Set aside. 
Grill the face of each of the buns on a griddle or frying pan over medium heat.  Roll the ground beef into a ball and pat it out until it's approximately the same diameter as the bun.  Cook meat on hot griddle or frying pan for about 5 minutes per side or until done.  Be sure to lightly salt and pepper each side of the patty. 
Build the burger in the following order, from the bottom up: 
On Bottom Bun; -  beef patty - American cheese slice - 1 to 2 tomato slices - lettuce. 
On Top Bun; -  mayo/mustard - ketchup - onions. 
Slap the top onto the bottom and serve hot. 
This recipe yields 1 burger.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  margarine -- melted, divided
  2               cups  Bisquick baking mix
     2/3          cups  buttermilk

     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 
Combine the baking mix, buttermilk, sugar, salt, and half of the melted margarine in a medium bowl.  Mix until well-blended.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 30 seconds, or until dough becomes elastic. 
Roll dough to about 3/4-inch thick and punch out biscuits using a 3-inch cutter.  Arrange the punched-out dough on an ungreased baking sheet, and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the biscuits are golden on top and have doubled in height. 
Remove the biscuits from the oven and immediately brush each one with a light coating of the remaining melted margarine.  Serve warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sifted all-purpose flour
                        (plus 1/2 cup divided and reserved
                        for kneading and rolling)
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Cheese Topping
                        powder
                        (or 2 pkgs dry cheese powder from 2 boxes
                        of Kraft macaroni & cheese)
  3        tablespoons  shortening
     1/3           cup  buttermilk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- for tops, (optional)

Sift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder and cheese powder in a large bowl.  Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion until dough is broken down into rice-size pieces.  Mixture will still be very dry.  Stir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and sticky. 
Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and work it in until it can be handled without sticking, then turn it out onto a floured board, being sure to keep 1/4 cup of the reserve flour for later.  Knead the dough well for 60 to 90 seconds, and the flour is incorporated.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour. 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Spray a light coating of cooking spray on a baking sheet. 
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and use the remaining reserved flour to dust a rolling surface.  Roll about one-third of the dough to just under 1/16th of an inch thick.  Trim the edges square (a pizza cutter or wheel works great for this), then transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet.  Use the rolling pin to transfer the dough.  Simply pick up one end of the dough onto a rolling pin, and roll the dough around the rolling pin.  Reverse the process onto the baking sheet to transfer the dough. 
Use a pizza cutter to cut across and down the dough, creating 1-inch square pieces.  Use the blunt end of a skewer or broken toothpick to poke a hole in the center of each piece.  Sprinkle a very light coating of salt over the top of the crackers (crackers will already be quite salty) and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, mix the crackers around (so those on the edge donÃ­t burn) and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until some are just barely turning a light brown.  Repeat the rolling and baking process with the remaining dough. 
This recipe yields approximately 300 crackers.

Sift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder and cheese powder in a large bowl.  Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion until dough is broken down into rice-size pieces.  Mixture will still be very dry.  Stir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and sticky. 
</DirT>

Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and work it in until it can be handled without sticking, then turn it out onto a floured board, being sure to keep 1/4 cup of the reserve flour for later.  Knead the dough well for 60 to 90 seconds, and the flour is incorporated.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  Betty Crocker chocolate fudge cake mix -
                        (18 1/4 oz)
  3        tablespoons  shortening -- melted
     1/2           cup  cake flour -- measured then sifted
  1                     egg
  3        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  brown paste food coloring -- see * Note,
                        (optional)

* Note:  This is an optional step to help recreate the color of the original cookie.  If you do not use the paste food coloring be sure to change the amount of water added to the wafer cookies from 3 tablespoons to 1/4 cup.  The food coloring gives the cookies the dark brown, almost black color.  The coloring can be found with cake decorating supplies at art supply and craft stores. 
Combine the cookie ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the water a little bit at a time until the dough forms.  Cover and chill for 2 hours. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  On a lightly floured surface roll out a portion of the dough to just under 1/16-inch thick.  To cut, use a lid from a spice container with a 1 1/2-inch diameter (Schilling brand is good). 
Arrange the cut dough rounds on a cookie sheet that is sprayed with a light coating of non-stick spray.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove wafers from the oven and cool completely. 
As the cookies bake, make the filling (recipe in More Top Secret Recipes on page 68).  When the cookies have cooled, roll a small portion (heaping 1/4 teaspoon) of the filling into a ball (just over 1/4-inch in diameter), and press it between two of the cookies.  Repeat with the remaining cookies. 
This recipe yields 108 to 116 wafers; for 54 to 58 sandwich cookies.

              Outback Steakhouse's Honey Wheat Bushman Bread

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  honey
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 2/3           cups  wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  cocoa
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  instant coffee
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4      teaspoons  yeast - (1 pkg)
                        === COLORING ===
     1/4           cup  water
  75             drops  red food coloring
  45             drops  blue food coloring
  30             drops  yellow food coloring
                        cornmeal -- for dusting

If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough in the exact order listed into the pan of your machine.  Set it on "knead" and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the food coloring with 1/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as it combines.  After the dough is created let it rest to rise for an hour or so.  Then remove it from the pan and go to step #3. 
If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar, coffee and salt in large bowl.  Make a depression or "well" in the middle of the dry mixture.  Pour the warm water into this "well," then add the butter, honey and yeast.  Combine the food coloring drops with 1/4 cup of water and add that to the "well."  Slowly mix the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into the wet.  When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand, kneading the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is very smooth and has a consistent color.  Set the dough into a covered bowl in a warm place for an hour, to allow it to rise. 
When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and divide it into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those halves in half, and then once more).  Form the portions into tubular shaped loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide.  Sprinkle the entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie sheet, or two.  Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic wrap and let the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Uncover the dough and bake it for 20 to 24 minutes in the hot oven.  Loaves should begin to darken slightly on top when done.  Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter on the side.  If you want whipped butter, like you get at the restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high speed to whip some butter until it's fluffy. 
This recipe yields 8 small loaves.

NOTES : It is normal for this dough to be a bit tacky and to seem somewhat thin.  Just be sure to add plenty of flour to your hands and work surface when working with the dough to prevent sticking.  If you are able to find caramel color, you can use that rather than the food coloring formula described in the recipe.  Just measure 1 tablespoon of caramel color into the dough mixture where the recipe uses food coloring and water.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shredded coconut
  4       large scoops  vanilla ice cream
     1/2           cup  Hershey chocolate syrup
                        Whipped cream (in a can)
  4              large  ripe strawberries

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Spread the coconut over the bottom of the inside of a large oven pan.  Shake the pan a little to spread the coconut evenly.  Bake the coconut for 25 to 30 minutes or until the coconut is a light, golden brown.  You may have to stir or shake the coconut in the last 10 minutes to help it brown evenly. 
When the coconut has cooled, pour it onto a plate, or into a large bowl.  Roll each scoop of ice cream in the coconut until it is well coated.  Press down on the ice cream to help the coconut stick.  Put the ice cream into four separate bowls. 
Heat up the chocolate syrup for 10 to 15 seconds in the microwave.  Pour about two tablespoons over each scoop of ice cream.  Try to completely cover the ice cream with chocolate. 
Spray some whipped cream on the top of each scoop of ice cream.  Cut the stems from the strawberries and place one on each serving; upside down on the whipped cream.  Serve with a spoon. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Bisquick baking mix
  1 3/4            cup  finely-shredded cheddar cheese
     2/3          cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted, divided
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  fine parsley flakes
     1/3           cup  crab meat (fresh or canned lump)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. 
Combine baking mix, 1 cup of the cheddar cheese, milk, and 1 half of the melted butter in a medium bowl.  Mix by hand until well-combined.  Pat out the dough into circle approximately 8 inches in diameter, with a slight lip around the edge, like a pizza crust. 
Sprinkle the parsley over the top of the dough.  Be sure the dried parsley flakes are crushed fine.  You can easily crush the flakes in a small bowl with your thumb and forefinger. 
Sprinkle the crab over the top of the dough.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the crab.  DonÃ­t go all of the way to the edge of the dough -- leave a margin of a half-inch or so around the edge. 
Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the cheese on top begins to slightly brown. 
Combine the remaining butter with the garlic powder and brush it over the top of the bake as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Slice it like a pizza into 8 pieces and serve hot. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil

NOTES : Here's a cool clone for the tangy orange-red onion sauce slathered over hot dogs ordered from Sabretts push carts.  For a buck or two you can grab a hot dog with the works on the fly from these popular umbrella-covered food carts in many major cities.  You find hundreds of 'em in New York City, especially around Central Park (that's where the sample for this recreation was obtained).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water - (8 cups)
  3                     Lipton tea bags (orange pekoe and
                        pekoe cut black tea blend)
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  lemon juice -- plus
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice

Boil the water in a large saucepan over high heat.  When the water comes to a rapid boil, turn off the heat, put the tea bags into the water, and cover. 
After the tea has steeped about 1 hour, pour the sugar into a 2-quart pitcher, then add the tea.  The tea should still be warm, so the sugar will dissolve easily.  Add the lemon juice.  Chill. 
This recipe yields 2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  garlic
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     2/3           cup  water
  1                cup  pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  teriyaki sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1 1/3           cups  dark brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  minced white onion
  1         tablespoon  Jack Daniels whiskey
  1         tablespoon  crushed pineapple
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Cut about 1/2-inch off of top of garlic.  Cut the roots so that the garlic will sit flat.  Remove the papery skin from the garlic, but leave enough so that the cloves stay together.  Put garlic into a small casserole dish or baking pan, drizzle olive oil over it, and cover with a lid or foil.  Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 1 hour.  Remove garlic and let it cool until you can handle it. 
Combine water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir occasionally until mixture boils then reduce heat until mixture is just simmering. 
Squeeze the sides of the head of garlic until the pasty roasted garlic is squeezed out.  Measure 2 teaspoons into the saucepan and whisk to combine.  Add remaining ingredients to the pan and stir. 
Let mixture simmer for 40 to 50 minutes or until sauce has reduced by about 1/2 and is thick and syrupy.  Make sure it doesn't boil over. 
This recipe yields 1 cup of glaze.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Crab                            Seafood
                Shellfish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  snow crab clusters (legs)
  4             quarts  water - (16 cups)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1 1/2                 celery stalks -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- quartered
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2          teaspoons  mustard seed
  1         tablespoon  chopped pimento
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2                     bay leaves
     1/3           cup  tomato sauce
  2        tablespoons  half-and-half
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  basil
     1/8      teaspoon  marjoram

Remove all the crab meat from the shells and set it aside. 
Put half of the shells into a large pot with 4 quarts of water over high heat.  Add onion, 1 stalk of chopped celery, and garlic, then bring mixture to a boil.  Continue to boil for 1 hour, stirring occasionally  (The white part of the shells will start to become transparent), then strain stock.  Discard the shells, onion, celery and garlic, keeping only the stock. 
Measure 3 quarts (12 cups) of the stock into a large sauce pan or cooking pot.  If you don't have enough stock, add enough water to make 3 quarts.  Add potatoes, bring mixture to a boil, then add 1/2 of the crab and the remaining ingredients to the pot and bring it back to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer for 4 hours, uncovered until it reduces by about half and starts to thicken. 
Add the remaining crab and simmer for another hour until the soup is very thick. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water - (16 cups)
  6               cups  chicken stock
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, sliced

  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  frozen yellow corn
     2/3           cup  diced canned roasted red pepper
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  shelled pistachios
     1/2           cup  roasted cashews
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  butter

                  The Soup Nazi's Mexican Chicken Chili

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken breast fillets - (4 fillets)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  10              cups  water
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
  1                     potato -- peeled, chopped
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1                cup  frozen yellow corn
     1/2                carrot -- sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- diced
  1                cup  canned diced tomatoes
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz) -- plus liquid
     1/4           cup  diced canned pimento
  1                     jalapeÃo -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
  1               dash  basil
  1               dash  oregano
                        === ON THE SIDE ===
                        Sour cream
  1              pinch  chopped fresh Italian parsley

SautÃ the chicken breasts in the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Cook the chicken on both side until done -- about 7 to 10 minutes per side.  Cool the chicken until it can be handled.  Do not rinse the pot. 
Shred the chicken by hand into bite-sizes pieces and place the pieces back into the pot.  Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and turn heat to high.  Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4 to 5 hours.  Stir mixture often so that many of the chicken pieces shred into much smaller bits.  Chili should reduce substantially to thicken and darken (less orange, more brown) when done. 
Combine some chopped Italian parsley with sour cream and serve it on the side for topping the chili, if desired. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine some chopped Italian parsley with sour cream and serve it on the side for topping the chili, if desired.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/8      teaspoon  dry unflavored gelatin
     1/3           cup  white vinegar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-minced red bell pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1               dash  parsley
  1               dash  oregano
  1               dash  thyme
  1               dash  basil
  1         tablespoon  grated Romano cheese
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  egg substitute
                        === PITAS ===
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  chopped Romaine lettuce
     1/4           cup  shredded red cabbage
     1/4           cup  shredded carrot
  4                     pita breads
  4          teaspoons  shredded fresh Parmesan

Make the dressing by first dissolving the gelatin in the water.  Heat the mixture in the microwave on high for two minutes or until it begins to rapidly boil.  Add the vinegar, then whisk while adding the oil.  Add bell pepper, salt, garlic powder, Worcestershire, black pepper, parsley, oregano, thyme and basil.  Let dressing cool for about 15 minutes before adding cheeses and egg substitute.  Whisk until slightly thicker, then chill.  Overnight refrigeration makes the dressing thicker. 
Preheat a barbecue or indoor grill to medium heat.  Salt and pepper the chicken, then grill it for 5 minutes per side, or until done.  Remove chicken from the grill and dice it. 
While chicken cooks, prepare the salad by combining the Romaine lettuce, red cabbage and shredded carrot in a large bowl and toss. 
Prepare the sandwiches by first microwaving each pita for 20 seconds.  Fold each pita in half like a taco, then add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the romaine salad into the bread.  Add about 1/3 cup of diced chicken on top of the salad in the pita.  Pour about a tablespoon of dressing over each sandwich.  Sprinkle about a teaspoon of shredded fresh Parmesan on top of each one and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1               dash  parsley
  1               dash  oregano
  1               dash  thyme
  1               dash  basil
  1         tablespoon  grated Romano cheese
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  egg substitute
                        ==== GREEK TOPPING ====
  1                cup  crumbled feta cheese - (4 oz pkg)
     1/2           cup  seeded diced tomato
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced and chopped cucumber
     1/4           cup  diced red onion
                        === PITAS ===
  6               cups  shredded Romaine lettuce
     1/4           cup  shredded red cabbage
     1/4           cup  shredded carrot
  4                     pita breads

Make the dressing by first dissolving the gelatin in the water.  Heat the mixture in the microwave on high for two minutes or until it begins to rapidly boil.  Add the vinegar, then whisk while adding the oil.  Add bell pepper, salt, garlic powder, Worcestershire, black pepper, parsley, oregano, thyme and basil.  Let dressing cool for about 15 minutes before adding cheeses and egg substitute.  Whisk until slightly thicker, then chill.  Overnight refrigeration makes the dressing thicker. 
Make the Greek topping for the sandwiches by combining the crumbled feta cheese, tomato, cucumber, and red onion in a small bowl. 
Prepare the salad by combining the romaine lettuce, red cabbage and shredded carrot in a large bowl and toss. 
Prepare the sandwiches by first microwaving each pita for 20 seconds.  Fold each pita in half like a taco, then add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the romaine salad into the bread.  Add 1/2 to 1/3 cup of the Greek topping to each sandwich.  Pour about a tablespoon of dressing over each sandwich and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.
