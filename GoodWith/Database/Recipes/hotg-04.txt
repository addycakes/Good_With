                        === GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- mashed
  10            sprigs  fresh marjoram
  4                     halibut fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === LENTIL-GREEN APPLE SALAD ===
  1                     red onion -- thickly sliced
  2                     tart apples -- cored, and
                        cut into 1/8" slices
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  2               cups  lentils
  2             sprigs  fresh marjoram
  1                     garlic clove -- mashed
  1                     shallot -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Glaze:  Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat.  Add the onions and cook until soft.  Add the ginger and cook an additional minute.  Raise the heat to high, add the apple cider, brown sugar and honey and reduce to 1 cup.  Let cool.

Marinade:  Combine marinade in a medium shallow baking dish.  Add halibut fillets and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Preheat grill to medium-high.  Remove halibut from marinade and season with salt.  Grill, skin-side down for 3 to 4 minutes on each side or preferred doneness.  During the last 1 minute of grilling, brush the skin side with the glaze.  Remove from the grill and glaze each fillet again.

Lentil-Green Apple Salad:  Preheat grill to high.  Brush onion slices and apple slices with olive oil and grill on both sides until golden brown.  Remove from the grill and cut into dice.

In a saucepan, combine lentils, marjoram, garlic, shallot, stock and water and season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a simmer and cook at a gentle simmer for 30 minutes or until lentils are just tender, drain and place lentils in a medium bowl, removing the marjoram sprigs and garlic.  Add the grilled apples and onions and drizzle with a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  prepared horseradish -- drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     sheets pasta dough
  2                     eggs -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water
                        === GREEN PEA SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  fresh green peas
  3               cups  vegetable stock
  1           teaspoon  toasted coriander seeds -- ground
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PIQUILLO PEPPER-BLACK OLIVE RELISH ===
  4                     Piquillo peppers -- julienned
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped pitted Nicoise olives
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     1/4         pound  ricotta salata -- finely shaved
                        Coarsely-chopped cilantro

Artichoke And White Bean Ravioli:  Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft.  Add the sliced artichokes and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the beans and horseradish, stir to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Lay a sheet of pasta dough on a lightly floured work surface and distribute a heaping teaspoon-sized portion of the filling at least 2 inches apart.  Use your fingertip or a brush to moisten the edges of the pasta sheet with the egg wash.

Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut along straight lines of the vertical and horizontal to form each ravioli square.  Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes.  Drain and serve immediately.

For the Green Pea Sauce:  Place peas and vegetable stock in a medium saucepan and cook until peas are very soft.  Place mixture in a blender and blend until smooth.  Strain back into the pan and bring to a simmer.  Cook until the mixture has thickened slightly.  Season with coriander, lemon zest, cilantro and salt and pepper to taste.

For the Piquillo Pepper-Black Olive Relish:  Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and season with pepper.  Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes

To Assemble:  Place 5 ravioli in each bowl.  Ladle green pea sauce over the ravioli, garnish with ricotta salata and cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === CHICKEN MARINADE ===
  1                cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  8                     blue corn tortillas - (6" dia)
     1/2           cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese
     1/2           cup  grated white cheddar cheese
     1/2                red onion -- finely sliced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped cilantro
                        Cilantro -- for garnish

For Chicken Marinade:  Whisk together soy sauce, oil, ginger, garlic and black pepper in a medium shallow baking dish.  Add the chicken breasts and turn to coat.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.

Heat a large grill pan over high heat until smoking.  Remove chicken from marinade and season with salt to taste.  Grill for 4 to 5 minutes on each side until just cooked through.  Let rest 5 minutes, slice each breast on the bias into 6 slices.

For the Red Curry Peanut Sauce:  Heat peanut oil in a medium saucepan over high heat.  Add the curry paste and saute for 3 to 4 minutes.

To Assemble:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lay tortillas out on a flat surface.  Divide both of the cheeses among the tortillas.  Top the cheese with 3 slices of the chicken, some of the red onion and cilantro.  Fold the tortillas over to form a half moon and brush the tops with peanut oil.

Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the cheese melts.  Serve 2 on a plate, drizzle with the red curry-peanut sauce and sprinkle with peanut relish and cilantro.

  2        tablespoons  squid ink

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GREEN ONION VINAIGRETTE ===
  8                     scallions
     1/2         large  white onion -- cut into chunks
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/3           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1                cup  pure olive oil
  1           teaspoon  honey

  1              pound  lobster -- steamed, meat

Risotto:  Heat olive oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and garlic and saute until soft.  Add the rice and mix to coat with the oil and cook for 2 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, add the wine and cook until all the liquid has evaporated.

Place the stock and the squid ink in a large saucepan over high heat and stir to combine.  Begin adding the hot squid stock 1 1/2 cups at a time and cook until the liquid is absorbed.  Continue until the stock is gone and the rice is al dente.

Add the squid and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Grilled Prawns:  Preheat grill or grill pan.  Toss prawns in olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until just cooked through.

Green Onion Vinaigrette:  Blanch the scallions for 30 seconds in a large pot of boiling salted water over high heat.  Drain and shock in cold water.

Combine the scallions, onion, garlic, and vinegar in a blender and process until pureed.  With the motor running, slowly add the oil until emulsified.  Add the honey, season to taste with salt and pepper and pour into a squeeze bottle.

Assemble:  Spoon the Risotto into 4 bowls.  Top each bowl with 2 Grilled Prawns and drizzle with the Green Onion Vinaigrette and some of the chopped lobster.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOSTONES ===
  3                     green plantains -- quartered crosswise,
                        and peeled
  3               cups  peanut or canola oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        === SALMON TARTAR ===
  1              pound  salmon -- cut 1/4" thick dice
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  pureed canned chipotles
     1/4           cup  capers -- drained
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped scallions
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === AVOCADO-CHIPOTLE RELISH ===
  2                     Haas avocados -- peeled, pitted
  1         tablespoon  pureed canned chipotles
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  creme fraiche
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Tostones:  Heat oil in a heavy frying pan to 325 degrees.  Add the plantain quarters in 3 batches and fry until soft, about 2 minutes per side, turning once.  Transfer to a paper towel-line plate with a slotted spoon to drain.  Repeat with the remaining plantains.

Heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Using a tostone maker, tortilla press, meat pounder or other heavy object, flatten each plantain slice until 1/8-inch thick.  Fry the tostones until crisp and golden brown, about 1 minute per side.  Drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle immediately with salt.

Salmon Tartar:  Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Avocado-Chipotle Relish:  Place avocados, chipotle and lime juice in a medium bowl and mash with a fork until almost smooth, but some texture remains.  Add the creme fraiche and fold until almost combined (should have a marbled appearance) and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Assemble:  Place a heaping tablespoon of salmon tartar in the center of each tostones and top with a teaspoon of avocado-chipotle relish.  Garnish with cilantro leaf.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings as an appetizer.

Categories    : Duck                            Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (2 to 3 lbs) -- skin pricked all
                        over with a fork
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  red wine
  1                cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  anise seed
  3              whole  cinnamon sticks
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
                        === ORANGE VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  ancho or cayenne pepper -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  mesclun
                        === SAUTEED PEARS ===
  3                     Red or Bosc pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into eighths
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === PEANUT BRITTLE ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  lightly-salted peanuts -- skins removed
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Peanut brittle -- chopped finely
                        Chopped chives

Make the Duck/Marinade:  8 hours to 1 day before serving, prick the entire skin of the duck all over with a fork.  In a large pot over high heat, bring 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil and blanch the duck for 7 to 8 minutes in hot water.  Remove the duck from the water and place on a plate in the refrigerator.  Allow the duck to sit 3 to 4 hours.  Remove from the refrigerator and wipe the rendered fat from the skin of the duck.

In a medium saucepan, combine the marinade ingredients and cook over low to medium heat until thickened.  (Do not boil.  This will give the marinade a burnt taste due to the amount of brown sugar).  Allow the marinade to cool then brush the duck generously with the mixture.  (Reserve some of the marinade to baste the duck with while roasting.)  Refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the duck in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade every 5 minutes.  Remove the duck from the oven and let rest 10 minutes.

Remove the breasts from the bone and the thighs with the legs attached.  Place the thigh/legs into a medium saucepan pan with 1-inch of water in it.  Cover the pan and place in the 350 degree oven for approximately 40 minutes or until the meat falls off the bone.  Remove from the oven and set aside.

When cool enough to handle pick the meat from the bone and tear into bite sized-pieces.  Just before serving, place the breasts in a oven-proof skillet skin-side-down and heat 6 to 8 minutes (depending on your preference of doneness, i.e. rare, medium-rare).  Slice the breasts very thinly on the bias (each breast should yield 3 servings).  Keep the meat warm until service.

Make the Orange Vinaigrette:  In a saucepan over high heat, reduce the orange juice until it forms a syrup.  Let cool.  In a blender, combine the orange syrup, vinegar, honey and chili powder (if using).  Blend for 30 seconds.  With the blender running, slowly add the olive oil until the dressing emulsifies.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour into a plastic squeeze bottle.  (May be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.)  Bring to room temperature before serving.

Make the Sauteed Pears:  In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter, sugar and cinnamon and cook to a light syrup.  Add the sliced pears and cook until they are soft but still retain their shape.  Set aside.

Make the Peanut Brittle:  Make a caramel with the sugar, add the peanuts and pour onto a lightly greased baking sheet.  Let harden and coarsely chop.

Assemble the salad:  In a large bowl dress mesclun greens lightly with some of the orange vinaigrette and arrange on the top halves of 6 plates.  Arrange the breast in a fan shape beneath the greens and place the thigh meat on both sides of the greens.  Scatter the pears over the duck and dress lightly with the remaining vinaigrette.  Top with peanut brittle and chopped chives.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === BUCKWHEAT FLATBREAD ===
     1/2         ounce  fresh yeast
  1 1/2      teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/4           cups  water -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             ounces  bread flour
     3/4           cup  buckwheat flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === SPICY HUMMUS ===
  3               cups  chickpeas, cooked or canned -- drained, rinsed
  6                     roasted garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  chipotle puree
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  tahini
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VEGETABLES ===
                        Red bell peppers -- cut into strips
                        Sliced red onions
                        Sliced scallions
                        Blanched green beans
                        Thinly-sliced eggplant
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Ancho powder
     1/2         pound  goat cheese -- crumbled
                        Chopped Nicoise olives
                        Basil chiffonade
                        === ADDITIONAL SERVING SUGGESTIONS ==
                        Spiced nuts
                        Marinated olives
                        Cheese platter with an assortment of
                        cheeses and crackers
                        Crudite

For the Flatbread:  In an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the yeast, sugar, and water.  Mix for 1 minute on low speed and let sit until the mixture just begins to bubble.

Attach the dough hook and add the flours and salt to the yeast mixture.  Mix until it forms a mass, the dough should be sticky.  Continue to add additional flour, if necessary, until the surface is dry enough to handle and dry enough to roll.

Divide the dough into pieces, roll into balls and lightly brush with oil.  Place on a floured surface and cover the balls with plastic wrap and a clean cloth and let proof for 2 hours at room temperature or place on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover and let proof overnight in the refrigerator.

To form flatbread, pat each piece of dough out into a 5-inch disk and sprinkle liberally with flour.  Roll each disk on a floured surface into a 10-inch diameter circle.

Puncture the dough liberally with a fork to keep it from rising.  Grill or bake each on a pizza stone or a lightly greased sheet pan for about 5 minutes at 425 degrees until dough starts to get crisp on the edges but still remains chewy.

Spicy Hummus:  Place chickpeas, garlic, chipotle puree, lemon juice, and tahini in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth.  With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper.

To assemble and bake:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Top each pre-baked flatbread with the spicy hummus.  Arrange any or all of the veggies on top of the hummus.  Season with salt, pepper, and ancho powder.

Place the bread back in the oven and bake for 5 minutes to heat through.  Remove and add olives, goat cheese, and fresh basil.  Cut into small squares and place on a platter.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Categories    : Cupcakes                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  cake flour
     1/2           cup  Dutch processed unsweetened cocoa powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  strong -- hot coffee
                        === PEANUT BUTTER BUTTERCREAM FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  creamy peanut butter
  1 1/4           cups  sifted confectioners' sugar
                        === GANACHE FROSTING ===
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  roasted peanuts -- chopped

Set rack in the middle of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line a 12 slot muffin pan with large paper or foil cupcake liners.  Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt together 3 times.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together at high speed for 15 seconds until combined.  Add the eggs 1 at a time beating until each is incorporated.  Continue beating until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes longer.

With the mixer at its lowest speed, beat in 1/3 the flour mixture.  Beat in the buttermilk and vanilla, then another third of the flour.  Beat in the coffee and then the remaining flour.

Fill the sections of the muffin tin 1/2 full and bake for 15 minutes or until the centers spring back when lightly pressed.  Set pan on a rack to cool.

Peanut Butter Buttercream Filling:  Beat the butter and peanut butter at medium speed in a mixing bowl until blended.  Reduce speed to low and gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar.  Increase speed to high and beat for 3 to 5 minutes until smooth and fluffy.

Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium, plain tip with filling.  Insert tip into each cooled cupcake and squeeze approximately 3 tablespoons of filling into each cupcake.

Ganache Frosting:  Place chocolate in a medium bowl.  Bring the cream to a scald in a small saucepan.  Pour cream over chocolate and let sit 1 minute, then whisk until smooth.  Let sit for 10 minutes until thick, but still pourable.

Dunk the top half of the cupcakes into the frosting to coat, then place on a rack and sprinkle with the chopped peanuts.  Transfer to the refrigerator for 20 minutes to set.

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

  1                cup  sundried cranberries
  2        tablespoons  pinenuts -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon

  4               cups  homemade chicken stock
     1/4           cup  white wine
     1/4           cup  red wine
     1/4           cup  cranberry juice
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  chipotle puree
                        Salt -- to taste

Cranberry Filled Pork Tenderloin:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut a pocket into the side of each pork chop going 3/4 of the way through.  Season chop with salt and pepper and stuff the pocket with the Sundried Cranberry Filling.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium oven-proof saute pan over high heat.  Add the pork chops and sear on both sides.  Add 1 cup Chicken-Cranberry Sauce.  Place the pan in the oven and roast until the meat is firm to the touch, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Spoon the chicken-cranberry sauce on a plate and top with pork chops.  Garnish with dried cranberries and toasted pine nuts.

Sundried Cranberry Filling:  Place the cranberries in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water, let sit 30 minutes to rehydrate.  Drain and reserve soaking liquid.  Place cranberries and remaining ingredients in a food processor with a 1/4 cup of the soaking liquid and process until smooth.  Season with salt.

Chicken-Cranberry Sauce:  Place chicken stock in a nonreactive medium saucepan over high heat and cook until reduced to 2 cups.  Add wines, cranberry juice, brown sugar, peppercorns and chipotle puree and continue cooking until thickened to a sauce consistency.  Season with salt.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     pork tenderloins - (2 lbs ea)

Black Beans And Rice:  Place the soaked beans in a large saucepan, cover with water, add the ham hock and beer.  Cook over medium-high heat until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Drain.

Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until almost smoking.  Add the onions and cook until soft.  Add the rice and cook, stirring until it is coated with the oil, about 2 minutes.  Add the water and 1 tablespoon salt, stir, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.

Spicy Orange Vinaigrette:  Heat orange juice in a medium saucepan and reduce to 1/4 cup.  Let cool slightly.  Combine the orange syrup, vinegar, mustard and ancho chile powder in a blender and blend 30 seconds.  With the motor running slowly add the oil until the dressing emulsifies.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Marinade:  Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.  Reserve 1/2 cup of the marinade, pour the remaining marinade into a large baking dish, add the tenderloin and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.

Preheat grill pan until almost smoking.  Remove pork from marinade and grill for 10 to 12 minutes basting with the reserved marinade.  Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.

Spoon rice and beans onto a large platter, top with sliced pork and drizzle with Spicy Orange Vinaigrette.

For the Soup:  Heat oil in a 4-quart pot, add the onion, celery, garlic, carrot and pancetta and cook until soft.  Add the cabbage, chard, potato, water, broth, tomatoes and bouquet garni.  Bring the soup to a gentle simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.

Place half of the beans (1 1/2 cups) in a food processor and process until smooth.  Add the puree and the whole beans to the simmering soup.  Simmer the soup for about 5 minutes.  Add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with sauteed croutons and cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSHROOM DUXELLE ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2             pounds  cremini mushrooms -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POTATOES ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- clarified
  4              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly on a mandoline
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Mushroom Duxelle:  Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat until almost smoking; add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and dry.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft.  Add the wine and cook until reduced.  Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.

For the Potatoes:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Pour 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter into an iron skillet and heat over high heat.  Arrange potatoes slices in the pan in concentric circles, overlapping the slices, drizzle each layer with butter, season with salt and pepper and spread some of the mushroom duxelle over the entire surface.  Repeat to make 4 to 5 layers.

Heat the pan on top of the stove until the butter bubbles.

Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the potatoes are golden brown and soft, 20 to 25 minutes.  Press the potatoes with a pot lid during the baking once or twice to keep them flat.

Remove from the oven and pour out excess butter.  Let sit 10 minutes before inverting onto a round platter.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2               cups  basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     1/2         pound  merguez sausage -- grilled, and
                        thinly sliced
  16                    ramps or 2 leeks -- grilled, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  manchego cheese -- finely sliced
  6                     plum tomatoes -- oven roasted,
                        and coarsely chopped, see * Note
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated

* Note:  To oven roast tomatoes -- slice plum tomatoes in half, lengthwise, brush with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place in a 300 degree oven on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes

Flatbread:  Mix water and yeast and let stand 15 minutes.  Gradually pour in 2 cups of the flour mixture and to incorporate.  Mix for about 1 minute to form a sponge.  Let stand, covered for at least an hour.

Put sponge in the bowl of a standing electric mixer.  Using the dough hook, add the salt and oil, then flour 1/2 cup at a time to form a dough.  Remove from bowl and knead until smooth for approximately 7 minutes.  Place in a clean oiled bowl and let rise, slowly, about 2 1/2 hours.

Divide dough into 4 balls, let rise again for 1/2 hour and roll out into a freeform rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly oil a baking sheet, place the dough on the sheet and prick the surface with a fork.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until lightly golden brown.

Pesto:  Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth.

Assembly:  Spread each flatbread with a few tablespoons of the pesto.  Top the pesto with the merguez, ramps, manchego and tomatoes.  Season with freshly ground black pepper.  Place the flat bread back in the oven and bake for 5 minutes to heat through.

Remove the flatbreads from the oven and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2               cups  canned plum tomatoes
  6                     roasted garlic cloves
                        Oven Roasted Tomatoes -- (see above)

Add the wine, raise the heat to high, and reduce until almost dry.  Add the stock, canned tomatoes, roasted garlic and Oven Roasted Tomatoes and reduce by one-quarter.

Puree the mixture in a food processor and pour into a large pot.  Add the thyme, honey and salt and pepper to taste and set aside until just before serving time.

Reheat over medium heat and pour into a large serving bowl.  Garnish with Garlic Chips.

Place, breast-side down in the pan and roast for approximately 12 to 14 minutes.  Check for doneness by seeing if juices run clear when bird is tipped.  Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.

Tamarind-Pineapple Barbeque Sauce:  Place chicken stock in a medium saucepan over high heat and reduce to 4 cups.

Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft.  Add the chile powders and cook for 2 minutes.

  1                cup  creme fraiche
     1/2                ripe mango -- peeled, pitted,
                        and finely diced
  2                     serrano peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and finely diced
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped red onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SMOKED TROUT ===
     1/2         pound  skinned and boned smoked trout -- flaked
                        Cilantro leaves

Finely grate the potatoes on a hand grater.  Place in batches into a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible, place in a large bowl.  Add the onion, beaten egg, baking powder, flour, and cilantro, and mix to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Heat 1/4 cup of vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet until almost smoking.  Drop potato mixture into the skillet, 1 heaping tablespoon at a time, and smooth the tops with the back of a spoon to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Fry over moderate heat, turning them once with a spatula for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crisp.

Remove to a platter lined with paper towels.  Repeat with remaining mixture, adding more oil if necessary.  Top each with a small dollop of Mango-Serrrano Creme Fraiche, flaked trout, and a cilantro leaf.

Mango-Serrrano Creme Fraiche:  Combine in a medium bowl.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  8                     cremini mushrooms -- quartered
                        === PASTA GRATIN ===

  3                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  flour
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
     3/4         pound  penne pasta -- cooked al dente
  1                cup  grated Gruyere cheese
  2         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives

For the Beef:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Heat oil and butter in a large Dutch oven over high heat.  Season the ribs with salt and pepper and cook on both sides for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.

Add all of the wine to the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom, add all of the remaining ingredients, except the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper.

Cover with the lid, braise on the stove top or place in the oven and let braise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until very tender.

Remove the meat to a plate and strain the cooking liquids into a bowl.  Clean out the pan and add the strained liquid into the pan.  Add the mushrooms and cook over high heat until reduced by 1/3.  Return the meat to the pan and cook for 5 minutes to heat through.

For the Pasta Gratin:  Place milk and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes, then remove the garlic.

Melt butter in a small saucepan, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes over low heat.  Gradually whisk in the milk and cream and cook over medium-high heat until thickened, season with salt and pepper and nutmeg, remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place cooked pasta in a buttered medium baking dish, add the sauce and stir to combine.  Sprinkle the Gruyere over the top of the pasta then sprinkle the Parmesan over the Gruyere.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes.  Turn on the broiler and broil, rotating the dish, until the cheese is golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROASTED CORN SOUP ===
  6               ears  corn -- roasted
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic

  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Fresh chives -- finely sliced
                        === CHORIZO AND GOAT CHEESE QUESADILLA ===
  8             ounces  chorizo
  6                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)
     1/2           cup  crumbled goat cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Roasted Corn Soup:  Scrape the kernels from each ear of corn with a sharp knife.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter and oil.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft.  Raise the heat to high, add the wine and cook until reduced.

Reduce the heat to medium, add the corn and sweat for 5 minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered for 20 minutes.

Place the mixture, in batches, into a blender and blend until smooth.  Return the mixture to the pan and heat over medium-low heat.  Stir in the cream and cook, until hot, about 1 minute.  Divide among 8 bowls and garnish with chives.

         Roasted Garlic And Goat Cheese Tamale With Thyme Butter

Categories    : Side Dish                       Tamales


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    dried corn husks
                        === MASA ===
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen corn kernels -- preferably fresh
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     roasted garlic head -- cloves removed
  2               cups  chicken stock or water
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  goat cheese -- crumbled
                        === FRESH THYME BUTTER ===
  1              stick  butter -- slightly softened
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

About 2 hours before you plan to form the tamales, clean the husks under running water.  Soak them in warm water for 2 hours, or until softened.

Puree the corn, onion, roasted garlic, and stock in a food processor.  Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and cut in the butter and shortening.

Using your fingers, mix in the cornmeal, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste until there are no visible lumps of fat.  Fold in the goat cheese.  The mixture will be a lot looser than you think it should be, but when the tamales are steamed it will dry out.

Remove the corn husks from the water and set aside the best 20 husks.  Drain and pat dry.  Tear the remaining husks into 1-inch wide strips to be used for tying.

Lay 2 husks flat on a work surface with the tapered ends facing out and the broad bases overlapping by about 3 inches.  Place about 1/3 cup of masa mixture in the center.  Bring the long sides up over the masa, slightly overlapping, and pat down to close (If the masa drips out a little at the seam, that is no problem).

Tie each end of the bundle with a strip of corn husk, pushing the filling toward the middle as you tie.  Trim the ends to about 1/2-inch beyond the tie.

Arrange the tamales in a single layer on a steaming rack, cover tightly with foil, and steam over boiling water for 45 minutes.

To serve, slice a slit on top of each tamale and push both ends of the tamale toward the middle to expose the masa.  Top with 1 tablespoon of the Fresh Thyme Butter.

Fresh Thyme Butter:  Combine the butter, thyme, and salt and pepper, to taste, in a food processor until smooth.  Place a sheet of parchment paper or waxed paper on a work surface.  Arrange the butter along one long side and form into a roll about 1-inch in diameter, leaving a 1-inch border of paper.  Roll up the butter in the paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- coarsely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  ripe mango -- peeled, pitted,

     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  6                     roasted garlic cloves -- smashed to a paste
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste

For the Chicken:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine the spices in a medium bowl.  Brush each poussin with oil and rub the spice mixture over the entire bird.

Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the onions and cook until soft.  Add the roasted garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mango, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the reduced stock and brown sugar and cook slowly over medium heat until the mango is very soft, and falling apart, 30 to 40 minutes.

Place the mixture, in batches, in a blender and blend until smooth.  Strain the mixture into a clean saucepan, whisk in the roasted garlic and cook for 10 to 15 minutes until reduced and slightly thickened.  Stir in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste.

For the Plantains:  Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet to 365 degrees.  Fry the plantains in batches until golden brown.  Remove them with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ANCHO CHILE-GINGER SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long) -- peeled, julienned
  1         tablespoon  ancho chile powder
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALMON ===
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     banana leaf -- cut 4 rectangles
                        === ROASTED VEGETABLE COUSCOUS ===
  2                     red peppers -- cut into 1" dice
  1                     yellow squash -- cut into 1" dice
  1                     zucchini -- cut into 1" dice
     1/4         pound  haricots verts -- cut on the bias
                        into 1" pieces
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  vegetable stock
  1              pinch  saffron
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  couscous

Salmon:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Rub each fillet with olive oil, season to taste with salt and pepper, and wrap envelope style in a banana leaf rectangle.  Place seam-side down on a sheet pan and roast 8 to 10 minutes.  When done, the fish will look a bit undercooked on top but will be firm and opaque.  Place the packets seam-side up on a platter and fold back the sides of the banana leaf.

Roasted Vegetable Couscous:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place the vegetables in a medium baking dish, toss with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Roast for 8 to 10 minutes until vegetables are just cooked through.

Bring vegetable stock, saffron and 1 teaspoon of salt to a boil in a medium saucepan, let boil for 5 minutes, until saffron blooms and colors the stock.  Add the couscous, stir, cover and reduce heat to low.  Cook until all liquid is absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes.

Place couscous in a large bowl, add the roasted vegetables and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve with salmon and ancho chile-ginger sauce.  Garnish with diced red pepper and cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED PEPPER-SPANISH PAPRIKA SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  Spanish paprika
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3                     red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded and coarsely chopped
     3/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BASS ===
  8                     striped bass - (1 lb ea) -- scaled, gutted
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BATTER FRIED POTATOES ===
     3/4           cup  beer
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  milk
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
     1/2           cup  seasoned flour
  10            medium  new potatoes -- cooked until just
                        tender and sliced 1/8"-thick
  4               cups  peanut oil

Red Pepper-Spanish Paprika Sauce:  Toast the paprika in a small skillet over medium heat until the aroma emerges and the color deepens, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

In a blender, combine the paprika with the vinegar, honey, and red peppers and blend well.  Slowly add the oil and blend until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper.

For the Bass:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Make 4 diagonal cuts on each side of each fish, reaching all the way down to the bone.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Place a large roasting pan on a burner over high heat.  When pan is hot add oil.  Heat oil to almost smoking.  Place the fish in the roasting pan and sear until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes per side.  When fish is seared, place the roasting pan into the oven and roast for 12 to 14 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.

Arrange the fish on a large serving platter with batter fried potatoes and drizzle with sauce.

For the Batter Fried Potatoes:  In a mixing bowl, combine the beer, egg, milk, flour, and melted butter and mix well.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add the thyme to the beer batter.

Place the batter and the seasoned flour in 2 separate bowls.  Season the potato slices with salt and pepper to taste.  In a saute pan over medium heat, heat the oil to 375 degrees or until a drop of batter sizzles on contact.

Dredge the potato slices in the flour, dip them in the batter, and fry in batches until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh turkey - (abt 16 lbs)
  20                    fresh sage leaves

                        Pomegranate seeds -- for garnish
                        === POMEGRANATE SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
  1                cup  port wine
  6               cups  home-made chicken stock
  2               cups  pomegranate juice
                        = (or substitute cranberry juice)
  2        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives
     1/2           cup  pomegranate seeds
                        === WILD RICE AND GOAT CHEESE STUFFING ===
  1 1/2           cups  wild rice
  5               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  coarsely-diced chorizo
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  onion -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2                     carrots -- finely chopped
  3                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
     3/4         pound  stale country-style bread -- cubed
  6             ounces  goat cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- plus extra, if
                        needed

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Remove the neck and gizzard from the turkey and discard.  Rinse the bird thoroughly with cold water and pat dry.  Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin from the breasts and drumsticks and slip the sage leaves underneath.  Rub the entire surface with 1/4 cup of the melted butter.  Lightly sprinkle the skin and cavity with salt and pepper.

Truss the turkey and place on a rack in a large roasting pan.  Roast for about 45 minutes, until brown, basting with the remaining butter every 10 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees and continue roasting for another 1 1/4 hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 180 degrees.  If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover them with foil.

Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and allow it to rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving.

To serve, cut down along each breast and remove it whole.  Cut the breast into slices, the way you would a loaf of bread.  Place on a large serving platter and arrange the thigh meat in chunks and the legs on top.  Spoon some Pomegranate Sauce over the top and sprinkle everything with the pomegranate seeds and chives.  Serve the remaining Pomegranate Sauce and the Wild Rice and Goat Cheese Stuffing alongside.

You can reheat sliced turkey over medium heat in stock just to cover.  Top with sauce, pomegranate seeds, and chives just before serving.

Pomegranate Sauce:  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and sweat the onion and garlic until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the peppercorns and cook another 3 minutes.

Add the port and cook, stirring, until most of it has evaporated.  Add the stock, pomegranate juice, molasses and brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and reduce slowly to a sauce consistency.  As the sugars caramelize, the sauce will turn brownish red.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and add chives and pomegranate seeds.

Wild Rice and Goat Cheese Stuffing:  Place the rice, water, and salt to taste in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Simmer until the grains open all the way.  Drain the rice.

Meanwhile, cook the chorizo in a small saucepan over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the chorizo gets a little crisp.  Drain.

Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery and sweat until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the rice, chorizo, bread, cheese, parsley, thyme, and stock and stir to combine.  The mixture should be quite wet; add a little more stock or water, if needed.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Transfer to a 6-cup buttered baking dish and bake, uncovered, until golden brown and heated through, 25 to 30 minutes.  May be refrigerated up to 1 day; reheat with a little chicken stock for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1              pound  soba noodles -- cooked al dente
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice

In a steamer, steam the broccoli until just tender, about 5 minutes.

In a large skillet, combine the hazelnut oil, garlic and hazelnuts.  Cook over high heat, stirring until the garlic is pale golden.  Add the broccoli and crushed red pepper and toss.  Season with salt and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.

Soba Noodles:  Place noodles in a large bowl.  Whisk together the soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, ginger, olive oil and sesame oil.  Pour over the noodles, add the cilantro and toss to combine, season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with scallion.

Salmon:  Season salmon on both sides with salt and pepper.  Mix together the sesame seeds in a medium bowl.  Dredge salmon skin-side down in the seeds.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sear the salmon seed-side down in the pan and cook until golden brown.  Turn the fillets over and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes for medium doneness.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  14                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed
                        === CANDIED MANGO CILANTRO BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1              large  ripe mango -- peeled, pitted and
                        coarsely chopped
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- slightly softened
  3        tablespoons  finely chopped cilantro

Wild Rice Waffles:  Preheat your Belgian waffle iron.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  Add the wild rice and stir just until the mixture is well combined, season well with salt and pepper to taste.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda.  In another bowl, beat together the milk, buttermilk and eggs.  Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir together with the whisk until just combined.  Stir in the wild rice mixture.

Lightly butter the grids of the waffle iron, if needed.  Spoon out 1 cup of batter onto the hot iron.  The batter will be thick so spread with a metal spatula.  Close the lid and bake until the waffle is golden and crisp.  Remove from the iron and cut into quarters

Mesa Curry Mixture:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.

Seafood And Sauce:  Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking.  Season the shrimp with salt and pepper to taste and saute for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until almost cooked through.

Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic, carrots, apples and curry and cook until soft.  Raise the heat to high, add the wine and cook until reduced.  Add the stock and cook until reduced by half.

Reduce heat to medium, whisk in the cream, coconut milk and brown sugar and cook until slightly thickened.  Add the shrimp and the clams and cook until the clams open.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Candied Mango Cilantro Butter:  Heat the brown sugar and honey in small saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar has melted and is bubbling.  Add the mango and cook over medium-low heat until the mango is soft and caramelized.  Place in a food processor and process until smooth, remove to a bowl and let cool.

Place butter in a food processor and add mango puree and process until smooth.  Fold in cilantro, scrape into a medium ramekin and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Assemble: Ladle the sauce into a bowl. Place 3 shrimp and 4 clams in each bowl. Top with 2 waffle quarters and a dollop of the candied mango butter. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wild Rice Waffles:  Preheat your Belgian waffle iron.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  Add the wild rice and stir just until the mixture is well combined, season well with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda.  In another bowl, beat together the milk, buttermilk and eggs.  Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir together with the whisk until just combined.  Stir in the wild rice mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly butter the grids of the waffle iron, if needed.  Spoon out 1 cup of batter onto the hot iron.  The batter will be thick so spread with a metal spatula.  Close the lid and bake until the waffle is golden and crisp.  Remove from the iron and cut into quarters
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mesa Curry Mixture:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Seafood And Sauce:  Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking.  Season the shrimp with salt and pepper to taste and saute for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until almost cooked through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic, carrots, apples and curry and cook until soft.  Raise the heat to high, add the wine and cook until reduced.  Add the stock and cook until reduced by half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce heat to medium, whisk in the cream, coconut milk and brown sugar and cook until slightly thickened.  Add the shrimp and the clams and cook until the clams open.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Candied Mango Cilantro Butter:  Heat the brown sugar and honey in small saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar has melted and is bubbling.  Add the mango and cook over medium-low heat until the mango is soft and caramelized.  Place in a food processor and process until smooth, remove to a bowl and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place butter in a food processor and add mango puree and process until smooth.  Fold in cilantro, scrape into a medium ramekin and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble: Ladle the sauce into a bowl. Place 3 shrimp and 4 clams in each bowl. Top with 2 waffle quarters and a dollop of the candied mango butter. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

                        === SAUCE ===
  8               cups  chicken stock
  6             ounces  frozen concentrated Granny Smith
                        apple juice
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (tightly packed)
  8              whole  black peppercorns
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === MAPLE GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  prepared horseradish -- drained
  2        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
                        === PORK CHOPS ===
     1/2           cup  ancho chile powder
     1/2           cup  pasilla chile powder
     1/2           cup  chopped garlic
  1                     center-cut pork loin - (9 bones)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === APPLE GINGER CHUTNEY ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  coarsely chopped red onion
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced ginger
  2             medium  oranges -- zest removed,
                        and finely sliced, flesh cut into segments
  2               cups  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  6             medium  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        halved and thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Sauce:  Combine the stock, apple juice, sugar and peppercorns in a medium saucepan over high heat and reduce to 3 cups.  Season to taste with salt and strain through a fine strainer.

Maple Glaze:  Mix all ingredients until well combined.

Pork Chops:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine the chile powders and garlic.  Season the pork loin to taste with salt and pepper and rub all surfaces with the chile mixture.

In a large roasting pan, roast the loin until medium-rare, about 40 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, cut between the bones into 8 chops.

In a heavy-ridged grill pan, sear the chops 3 minutes on each side until grill marked.  Place on a serving platter and brush with Maple Glaze.  Serve with Sauce and Apple Ginger Chutney on the side.

Apple Ginger Chutney:  In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the onion and jalapeÒo until the onion is translucent.

Add the ginger, orange zest, orange juice, vinegar, brown sugar and honey and cook until the sauce is reduced by half and has a glazed appearance.

Reduce the heat to low, add two thirds of the apple slices, and cook until the fruit is just tender.

Turn off the heat and gently fold in the remaining apples and the orange segments.  Pour the chutney into a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.  Mix in the cilantro, red bell pepper and salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

               Sweet Potato-Chicken Hash With Poached Eggs

Recipe By     :Bobby Flay
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HASH ===
  2              large  sweet potatoes
  3                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  canned chipotle peppers
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === POACHED EGGS ===
  3               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  4                     eggs
                        === GREEN CHILE HOLLANDAISE ===
  3              large  egg yolks -- lightly beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              large  poblano pepper -- roasted, skinned,
                        seeds removed and finely chopped
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- melted until foamy

To prepare the Hash:  In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Drain the potatoes, peel and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.

Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper and place in a saucepan of simmering water.  Poach for 10 to 12 minutes or until cooked through.  Cut each breast into 1/2-inch cubes.

Place the potatoes, chicken, scallion, cilantro, chipotles and honey in a large bowl and mix gently until combined, season with salt and pepper.  Form into 4 equal-sized patties.

Heat the oil in a large saute pan until just smoking.  Season the patties with salt and pepper to taste and saute the patties on each side until golden brown.  Keep warm.

To prepare the Poached Eggs:  Heat the water and vinegar until simmering in a large frying pan.  Break each egg into a cup and gently add to the water.  Poach for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the yolk is nearly cooked.  Remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon to drain the liquid and top each hash patty with 1 poached egg.

To prepare the Green Chile Hollandaise:  Place the yolks, salt, pepper in a blender and mix until smooth.  Slowly, drop by drop add the warm butter to the mixture and blend until emulsified.

To prepare the Hash:  In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Drain the potatoes, peel and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper and place in a saucepan of simmering water.  Poach for 10 to 12 minutes or until cooked through.  Cut each breast into 1/2-inch cubes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the potatoes, chicken, scallion, cilantro, chipotles and honey in a large bowl and mix gently until combined, season with salt and pepper.  Form into 4 equal-sized patties.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a large saute pan until just smoking.  Season the patties with salt and pepper to taste and saute the patties on each side until golden brown.  Keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the Poached Eggs:  Heat the water and vinegar until simmering in a large frying pan.  Break each egg into a cup and gently add to the water.  Poach for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the yolk is nearly cooked.  Remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon to drain the liquid and top each hash patty with 1 poached egg.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the Green Chile Hollandaise:  Place the yolks, salt, pepper in a blender and mix until smooth.  Slowly, drop by drop add the warm butter to the mixture and blend until emulsified.  Place in a bowl and fold in the chopped poblano peppers.  Serve immediately or place the bowl over a pot of simmering water to keep warm, stirring occasionally.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PRESERVED DUCK ===
  4                     duck legs
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  mixed spices
                        = (clove, nutmeg, white pepper, cinnamon)
  6               cups  rendered duck fat
  4                     juniper berries
                        === TOASTED ALMOND CREPES ===
     1/2           cup  toasted almond flour
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === SHERRY VINEGAR-APRICOT SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- finely sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  white wine
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
  6               cups  home-made chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into tablespoons
  4                     dried apricots -- soaked in hot water
                        for 1 hour and finely sliced

Preserved Duck:  Sprinkle the legs with salt and mixed spices on both sides.  Place in a large baking dish cover and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours.

Remove the legs from the refrigerator and scrape off the salt and spices.

Preheat broiler.  Place thighs on a baking sheet, skin side up.  Broil for 5 to 6 minutes or until the skin is browned.

Place legs in a medium saucepan and cover with the duck fat, add the juniper berries.  Bring the fat to a simmer and cook over low heat for 2 1/2 hours.

Place the legs in a medium crock and strain the fat over the duck to cover with the fat.  Let the duck come to room temperature and place in the refrigerator, for at least 1 week.

Remove the duck from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature.  Place some of the fat in a large saute pan and heat until almost smoking.  Add the thighs and cook until the legs become brown and very crisp.

Remove the skin, chop and continue cooking until golden brown and crispy to make cracklings.  Remove the meat from the bone and shred.

Toasted Almond Crepes:  In a mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, a pinch of salt and honey.  In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk and melted butter, add to the dry ingredients and mix well.

Heat a griddle or cast-iron frying pan over high heat and drop the batter by 1/4 cups into the pan to make 4 (5-inch) pancakes.  Cook pancakes until brown on both sides and set aside.

Sherry Vinegar-Apricot Sauce:  In olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft.  Increase heat to high, add the wine and sherry vinegar and cook until completely reduced.  Add the stock and reduce to 2 cups, whisk in the butter.  Add the apricots.

Assemble:  Place shredded duck meat in the center of each pancake and fold over.  Drizzle with the Sherry Vinegar-Apricot Sauce and garnish with the cracklings.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4         stick  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2          teaspoons  instant espresso powder (Medaglia D'Oro)
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  best-quality white chocolate chips
  1 1/2           cups  toasted pecans -- coarsely chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the chocolate in a medium bowl and place over a pot of simmering water and melt completely.  Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.

In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar.  Add eggs, then vanilla and espresso, and beat on high speed for 2 minutes.  On low speed beat in the melted chocolate mixture until just combined.  Fold in the flour mixture with a rubber spatula until just combined.  Stir in the chips and pecans.

Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop the mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, putting 8 cookies on each sheet.  Bake for 10 to 11 minutes.  The surface will be dry but the inside will still be soft.  It will take no longer than 10 to 11 minutes so set the timer.

Cool on a baking sheet.  Best eaten the day they are made.  Wrap leftovers well in plastic wrap and store in an airtight container.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4         pound  slab bacon -- cut small cubes
  1              large  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- finely diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  3 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  lentils -- washed, picked over

  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        Finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        === BROCCOLI RABE AND PECORINO ROMANO ===
  2             pounds  broccoli rabe -- tough stems peeled
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  5                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese
                        === VEAL ===
  4                     veal loin chops, 3/4"-thk -- (8 to 10 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-ground mixed peppercorns
                        = (red, pink, green, black)
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  cold unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary

For the Lentils:  Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the bacon and cook until golden brown.  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Cook the onion and carrot in the rendered fat until the onion softens.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add 3 cups of the water and wine and bring to a boil.  Stir in the lentils, bay leaf and thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Cover the pan partially and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes.  Add additional water is needed.  Discard bay leaf and stir in the reserved bacon and parsley.

For the Broccoli Rabe with Garlic and Pecorino Romano Cheese:  Cook broccoli rabe in large pot of boiling salted water for 3 minutes.  Drain and shock in ice water.  Drain again and pat dry.

Heat olive oil in a medium/large skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add broccoli rabe and saute until heated through, season with salt and pepper to taste.

Remove from heat and sprinkle 4 tablespoons of the cheese over and toss to combine.  Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cheese.

For the Veal:  Brush veal chops on 1 side with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Season with salt and dredge in the peppercorn mixture.

Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Sear the veal peppercorn-side down until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium, turn the chops over and continue cooking 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare doneness.  Remove veal from pan.

Increase heat to high, add shallots and cook until soft.  Add wine and reduce until dry.  Add stock and cook until reduced by half.  Swirl in the butter and rosemary and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Place veal over lentils and spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Veal:  Brush veal chops on 1 side with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Season with salt and dredge in the peppercorn mixture.

Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Sear the veal peppercorn-side down until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium, turn the chops over and continue cooking 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare doneness.  Remove veal from pan.

Increase heat to high, add shallots and cook until soft.  Add wine and reduce until dry.  Add stock and cook until reduced by half.  Swirl in the butter and rosemary and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Place veal over lentils and spoon sauce over.
