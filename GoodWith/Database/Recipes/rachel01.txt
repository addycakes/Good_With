Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     round or oval crusty chewy bread - (12")
                        = (such as Tuscan-style or
                        a sesame semolina)
  1                jar  giardiniera - (14 to 16 oz) -- drained
     1/2         pound  thinly sliced sharp provolone
  1                jar  roasted red peppers - (14 to 16 oz)
                        = (or 2 fresh roasted red bell peppers)
  1                can  quartered artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- drained
  1                     bag mixed salad greens - (12 oz) -- any variety
     1/2           cup  fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley leaves
  15                    fresh basil leaves - (to 20) -- torn
     1/3         pound  sliced Genoa salami
     1/3         pound  sliced sweet soppressata
     1/3         pound  sliced cappacola
                        = (hot cured pork shoulder)
     1/4                red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     vine-ripe tomato -- thinly sliced
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     hot or sweet pickled cherry peppers
  8                     bamboo party skewers - (8" to 12" long)
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Green and black olives
                        Herb flavored potato chips

Cut the top off of a large round or oval bread and hollow it out leaving a half-inch rim and bottom to your bread.  The loaf should resemble a bowl or deep pie shell.

Pulse the giardiniera in a food processor into a coarse relish.  Spread and press relish into the bottom of your bread shell in an even layer.  Top relish with a layer of provolone slices, red pepper pieces, and artichoke hearts.  Press ingredients down as you work to make room in your shell for as much antipasto as possible.

Combine mixed greens, parsley, and basil in a bowl.  Add a thin layer of greens on top of artichokes, and drizzle with oil.  Layer in meats and remaining cheese.  Top with a few more greens, onion and tomato slices, and another drizzle of oil.  Season the top of filled shell with salt and pepper.  Bag up remaining unused greens and herbs for tomorrow night's salad.

Replace top of bread and wrap your GIANT, drip-less antipasto stuffed pie for travel.

When you are ready to serve, spear hot or sweet cherry peppers on 10 or 12-inch bamboo skewers and space eight skewers equidistant around the bread.  Cut bread into wedges, like a pie, and serve with olives and fancy potato chips.

This recipe yields 8 wedges.

Comments:  Giardiniera is a Italian pickled salad of cauliflower, hot peppers and carrot found in International Foods aisle of market

To roast peppers, split each red bell pepper down the center and gut them by scooping out seeds with a tug using your cupped hand.  Place peppers skin-side-up under broiler preheated to high.  Leave oven door ajar for steam to escape and blacken peppers entirely.  Place charred peppers into a paper bag and roll the bag up tightly.  Let stand 5 minutes until peppers are cool enough to handle and peel off charred skins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  thin asparagus spears
  1                     packaged prepared foccacia - (12" dia)
  1                cup  Pesto Sauce -- (listed below)
                        = (or use store-bought)
     1/2         pound  Fontina -- diced small cubes
  1                     firm plum tomato -- seeded, diced
                        === PESTO SAUCE ===
  2               cups  fresh basil - (packed)
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, smashed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1/2)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Trim tough ends off asparagus, leaving 4- or 5-inch long tender tops of spears.  Place tops in a small skillet in 1/2-inch of boiling water.  Cover the pan and steam asparagus for 2 minutes.  Run asparagus under cool water and drain well.  Cut spears into 1-inch pieces on the diagonal.

Spread a foccacia with a thin layer of pesto sauce.  Dot the top of pizza pie with cubed Fontina cheese.  Add a scattering of chopped asparagus and diced plum tomatoes.

Bake directly on oven rack or on a perforated pizza pan.  Bake foccacia pie for 10 minutes in preheated oven on middle rack or, until the cheese melts and edges of your pizza are crisp and dark golden in color.

Pesto Sauce:  Combine basil, pine nuts, and garlic in a food processor with a drizzle of the olive oil.  Blend coarsely, stopping from time to time to scrape down the sides.  Place in small bowl, and stir in the remaining olive oil (as needed), Parmesan, and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields one 12-inch pizza.

                        A handful flat-leaf parsley leaves -- chopped
                        === TOURNEDOS ===
                        A drizzle olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2                     tournedos/ 1" to 1 1/4" thick

     1/2           cup  Madeira or Sherry
  2             sprigs  fresh tarragon -- chopped, 1 tbspn
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  1              pound  thin asparagus spears -- tender tips cut
                        into 2" pieces
  1                can  quartered artichoke hearts - (15 oz) -- drained
     1/4                lemon -- juiced
                        A drizzle extra-virgin oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        produce department)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Toss scallops with melted butter, garlic, shallots, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.  Transfer to shallow casserole dish.  Combine extra-virgin olive oil and bread crumbs.  Scatter bread crumbs over scallops and place in the casserole.  Bake scallops 10 to 12 minutes or until bread crumbs are deep golden and scallops are opaque.

Heat a small skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Coat pan with oil and butter and add room temperature fillet of beef steaks.  Meat will sear in hot pan.  Cook beef 4 minutes on each side for medium.  Season meat with grill seasoning or coarse salt and pepper once meat is fully cooked so the salt will not draw out juices prematurely.  Let meat rest 5 minutes for juices to redistribute.

Return pan to heat and deglaze, using liquid to combine any pan drippings.  Add Madeira, reduce by half, and add tarragon to the pan.  Set aside.

Steam asparagus tips in 1/4-inch boiling water for 3 minutes and drain.  Return tips to warm pan and combine with drained artichoke hearts, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Heat mixture through and remove from stove.

To serve, place steaks on buttered toast and drizzle with Madeira sauce.  Gently transfer 4 baked scallops to platters and finish plates with lemon dressed artichoke hearts and asparagus tips.  Edible flowers make a delicate, colorful garnish.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  1                     tin anchovies - (2 oz) -- drained
  4              large  garlic cloves -- cracked away from
                        skins and finely chopped
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  pasteurized cholesterol-free egg product
                        = (available on dairy aisle)

                        = (paper container or canned)
  2               cans  chunky style crushed tomatoes - -- (32 oz ea)
                        A handful flat-leaf parsley leaves -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice or cinnamon
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  penne rigate -- cooked to al dente
                        Grated Pecorino Romano -- as an accompaniment
                        Fresh crusty bread -- for mopping
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Caprese Salad -- (see recipe)
                        Five-Minute Fudge Wreath -- (see recipe)

Heat a deep pot over medium-high heat.  Add oil, garlic, bay, and pancetta bits and brown for 1 minute.  Add meats and brown and crumble them for 5 minutes.

Chop carrot, celery, and onions near the stove and add to the pot as you work.  Cook vegetables with meat 5 minutes and add wine.  Cook for 1 minute; add stock and tomatoes to the pot.

Stir in parsley, allspice, or cinnamon and season sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.  Bring sauce to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and cook 10 to 15 minutes minimum before serving.  Reheated sauce only improves.

Toss pasta (cook off only as much pasta as you need at the time: half a pound for every 3 people) with a couple of ladles of sauce to coat, then top bowl with extra sauce.  Top pasta with lots of cheese and pass bread at the table.

This recipe yields 4 large servings.

Comments:  The sauce will cover up to 2 pounds of pasta.  If you are making this full menu, prepare the fudge and chill while your sauce simmers and before you prepare your salad.  When you are done eating your 30 Minute meal, the fudge will have chilled for 45 minutes and will then be firm enough to slice.  Happy Holidays and Merry Eating!

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (2 turns around the pan)
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag semisweet chocolate morsels - (12 oz)
  9             ounces  butterscotch morsels
                        = (3/4 of a 12-oz bag)
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                can  walnut halves - (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  currants
  1                     eight-inch cake pan -- lightly greased with
                        Softened butter -- as needed
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Red and green candied cherries

Place a heavy pot on the stove and preheat it over low heat.  Add chips and milk and stir until chips are melted and milk combined.  Save the empty condensed milk can.  Stir in vanilla and remove fudge from heat.  Add nuts and currants and stir in immediately.

Cover empty condensed milk can with plastic food wrap and center it in the greased cake pan.  Spoon fudge into pan around can, making sure to recenter can if it drifts.

The fudge will set up almost immediately.  Garnish can only be added in the first minute or 2 the fudge is in the pan, so work quickly.  Decorate your wreath with "holly" made from cut candied red and green cherries.  A wreath left plain can be garnished with a pretty fabric bow when serving.  Chill covered in the refrigerator and slice fudge very thin when ready to serve, a little goes a long way.

This recipe yields 32 servings (2 pounds) (...before you eat it. Go for it!  You can hit the gym in January.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    jumbo shrimp in shell -- deveined, raw
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- for brushing

  2                     lemons -- halved

Preheat griddle or grill pan over high heat.

Brush shrimps with oil, season with salt and pepper and grill 2 minutes on each side, until shells are hot pink and shrimp is opaque.

Place lemons on grill the last minute.  The heat will release the juice from the lemons.  To serve, squeeze grilled lemon wedges over shrimp.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1              large  lemon -- juiced
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more,
                        for drizzling
  4             medium  to large portobello mushroom caps
                        Grill seasoning spice blend -- to taste
                        = (or coarse salt and black pepper)
  3              large  firm plum tomatoes -- seeded, diced

     1/2         pound  fresh smoked mozzarella -- thinly sliced

                        Garlic toasts or grilled crusty bread

Combine first 4 ingredients in a bowl or large food storage plastic bag.  Coat mushroom caps evenly in marinade.

Place mushroom caps on the grill cap-side-up and season with grill seasoning or salt and pepper.  If you are using an indoor tabletop electric grill, preheat to 400 degrees or "high" setting.  If you are using an outdoor gas grill, preheat to medium-high; for a charcoal grill, prepare coals and cook mushrooms 6 inches from hot coals.  Mushrooms will cook 4 to 6 minutes on each side.  Cook mushrooms covered or under tin foil tent and turn occasionally.

Combine tomatoes, rosemary, and smoked mozzarella.  Drizzle with oil and toss.

Fill mushroom caps with tomato mixture and top with sliced mozzarella.  The mushrooms will look like small pizzas.  Place caps in oven at 425 degrees until cheese melts or you can close grill lid or replace tin foil tent over mushroom caps to melt cheese, it will take 1 to 3 minutes.  Serve as-is or, place stuffed caps on garlic toast or sliced crusty bread to catch the juices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken breast or chicken tenders -- cut into chunks
     1/4           cup  all-purpose unbleached flour
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  wok or vegetable oil
                        = (preferred brand: House of Tsang)
  1         tablespoon  white or rice wine vinegar -- (a splash)
     1/2           cup  chicken broth or stock
  8             ounces  prepared lemon curd - (1 cup)
     1/4           cup  hot water
  1                     lemon -- zested
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
                        = (or 20 blades fresh chives, finely
                        chopped)
                        Special Rice -- (see recipe)

Coat the chunked chicken lightly in flour seasoned with a little salt.  Heat a large skillet or a wok-shaped nonstick pan over high heat.  Stir fry chicken until golden, 3 or 4 minutes.  Remove chicken from the pan and return pan to heat.  Reduce heat to medium.

Add a splash of vinegar to the pan and let it evaporate.  Add stock or broth to the pan and scrape up any drippings with a whisk.  Thin curd by stirring in a little hot water.  Add curd to broth and whisk to combine.

Add chicken back to the pan and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes to thicken sauce and finish cooking chicken pieces through.  Remove the pan from heat, add the scallions or chives and zest, and toss chicken pieces well to combine zest and scallions or chives evenly throughout the sauce.  Serve with Special Rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Notes:  Wok oil infused with ginger and garlic is usually available on the International Foods aisle in many markets.

Chicken broths and stocks are available in resealable paper containers, making storage of remaining product easy and on hand in the refrigerator; they are found in the soup aisle.

Lemon curd is a sweet lemon spread available in most markets.  It is on the jam/jelly aisle.

Combine meatballs and sauce and pile into sub rolls, 4 meatballs per sub.  Top with shredded cheese and place subs under broiler to melt cheese.  Top with shredded basil or arugula and serve with a pile of Oven Fries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  ground sirloin
                        = (90 percent lean ground beef)
  1              slice  white bread -- spread with
                        softened butter, then cut small cubes
     1/8           cup  milk
  1                     egg
  2          teaspoons  grill seasoning blend
                        = (or coarse salt and black pepper
                        combined)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1                     rounded tablespoon tomato paste
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped,
                        reserve 1/4 of the amount
                        === SMASHED POTATOES ===
  2             pounds  small red potatoes -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  2                     scallions, whites and greens -- chopped
     1/2           cup  milk
                        === 3-CONDIMENT PAN GRAVY ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Reserved onion from meatloaf mixture
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  beef stock - (to 1 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  spicy brown mustard - (rounded)
  1         tablespoon  steak sauce
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Baby Carrots -- (see recipe)
                        Dressed tossed salad

Place meat in a large mixing bowl and create a well in the center of the meat.  Fill the well with the bread cubes and dampen them with a splash of milk.  Pour 1 beaten egg over bread and add seasoning or salt and pepper, allspice, tomato paste and onion to the bowl.

Combine the meat, bread and grill seasoning or salt and pepper and form mixture into 4 large oval patties 3/4-inch thick.  Pan fry meatloaf patties in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat 7 minutes on each side under a loose tin foil tent.  The tent will reflect heat and allow the steam to escape the pan.

Cover the quartered, red-skinned potatoes in water in a medium saucepan.  Bring water to a boil and cook potatoes 10 minutes or until fork tender.  Turn heat under pan off; drain potatoes and return to hot pan and warm stovetop to dry potatoes out.  Add butter, sour cream, scallions, and milk to potatoes and smash to your desired consistency.  Season potatoes with salt, to taste.

Remove meat loaf patties to a platter and return pan to heat.  Reduce heat to medium and add butter and onion to your skillet.  Cook the onion 2 minutes and sprinkle pan with flour.  Cook flour 1 minute and whisk in 1 cup beef stock.  Bring broth to a bubble.  If gravy is too thick, thin with additional stock.  Stir in condiments and remove gravy from heat.

Slice meatloaf patties and drizzle with gravy.  Pile smashed potatoes along side and make a well in the center for sour cream or gravy.  Serve meatloaf and smashed potatoes with Baby Carrots, or with a tossed salad dressed with oil and vinegar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (2 turns around the pan)
     1/8         pound  pancetta - (abt 3 slices) -- chopped
  2             sprigs  rosemary - (4" to 6" long) -- left intact
  1              sprig  thyme (4" to 6" long) with
                        several sprigs on it -- left intact
  1              large  fresh bay leaf
                        = (or 2 dried bay leaves)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              small  carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cans  cannellini beans - (15 oz ea)
  1                cup  canned tomato sauce or
                        canned crushed tomatoes
  2               cups  water
  1              quart  chicken stock
  1 1/2           cups  ditalini
                        Grated Parmigiano or Romano -- for the table
                        Crusty bread -- for mopping

Heat a deep pot over medium-high heat and add oil and pancetta.  Brown the pancetta bits lightly, and add herb stems, bay leaf, chopped vegetables, and garlic.  Season vegetables with salt and pepper.

Add beans, tomato sauce, water, and stock to pot and raise heat to high.  Bring soup to a rapid boil and add pasta.  Reduce heat to medium and cook soup, stirring occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes or until pasta is cooked al dente.

Rosemary and thyme leaves will separate from stems as soup cooks.  Remove herb stems and bay leaf from soup and place pot on table on a trivet.  Let soup rest and begin to cool for a few minutes.

Ladle soup into bowls and top with lots of grated cheese.  Pass crusty bread for bowl mopping.

This recipe yields 6 BIG servings, leftovers improve.

Comments:  I could live on this recipe... a quick version of my Gran'pa Emmanuel's masterwork.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (2 turns around the pan)
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- chopped
  1                     tin flat anchovy fillets -- drained
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  20                    oil-cured black olives -- cracked away from
                        pit and coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  capers
  1                can  chunky-style crushed tomatoes - (32 oz)
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz) -- drained
                        A few grinds black pepper
     1/4           cup  flat leaf parsley -- chopped
                        = (a couple of handfuls)
  1              pound  spaghetti -- cooked to al dente
                        Crusty bread -- for mopping
                        Grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Romano -- (optional)
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Bitter Greens Salad -- (see recipe)

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add oil, garlic, anchovies, and crushed pepper.  Saute mixture until anchovies melt into oil and completely dissolve and garlic is tender, about 3 minutes: your kitchen never smelled so good!  Add olives, capers, tomatoes, black pepper, and parsley.  Bring sauce to a bubble, reduce heat, and simmer 8 to 10 minutes.

Toss sauce with cooked pasta.  Pass bread and cheese at the table and serve with a simple salad of mixed bitter greens dressed with oil and vinegar, salt, and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Note:  Get your olives from the bulk bins in the market, rather than buying a jar.  The unit price is always much less per pound and you can get just what you need for each recipe.

        Pork Chops, Cran-Apple Sauce, Parsley Potatoes, Snap Peas

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     center-cut boneless 3/4"-thk pork
                        loin chops
                        A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
                        Grill seasoning blend -- to taste
                        = (or coarse salt and pepper)
  5                     McIntosh apples -- peeled, chunked
     1/2           cup  dried sweetened cranberries
  1                cup  concentrated canned cran-apple juice
                        = (available on juice aisle of market)
  1 1/2         pounds  small red-skinned potatoes -- halved
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        A handful flat-leaf parsley leaves -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  sugar snap peas -- washed
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Drizzle chops with extra virgin olive oil, just enough to lightly coat the meat on both sides.  Place the chops in a hot pan and cook 6 to 7 minutes on each side under a loose tin foil tent.  The tent will reflect heat back into pan while allowing steam to escape.

Once the chops are turned, season with seasoning blend or coarse salt and pepper, to your taste.  After the chops are cooked through, remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes for juices to redistribute before serving.

In a medium saucepan, working over medium to medium-high heat, combine apples, sweetened dried cranberries, and cran-apple juice concentrate.  Cook apples into a chunky sauce, about 10 minutes.  Remove cran-apple sauce from heat and let it settle.

Simmer potatoes in just enough water to cover them for 10 minutes or until fork tender.  Drain and return potatoes to hot pot to dry them out.  Toss potatoes with butter, parsley, and a little salt.

Steam snap peas in 1 cup boiling water and 1 teaspoon sugar combined.  Cook covered for 3 to 5 minutes and drain with slotted spoon when serving.

Serve chops with cran-apple sauce and sides of potatoes and snap peas.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                         Quick Chicken Cacciatore

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast -- (3 pieces)
                        = (or 1 package boneless skinless
                        chicken thighs, if you prefer dark meat)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2                     portobello mushroom caps -- halved crosswise,
                        and thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed, minced
     1/2           cup  beef broth or stock
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
                        A handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  1              pound  egg ribbons or egg fettuccini -- cooked al dente
                        Crusty bread
                        Grated Parmigiano or Romano -- for passing

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add half of the extra-virgin olive oil and brown chicken breasts or thighs for 3 or 4 minutes on each side.  Remove chicken from pan and season with salt and pepper.

Return pan to stove, reduce heat to medium and add the remaining.  Add crushed pepper, sliced mushrooms, and garlic.  Season with salt (salt is a magnet for drawing out liquid).  Cover and cook mushrooms 5 minutes or until mushrooms are dark, tender and have given off their juices.  Add about 1/2 cup of beef broth to intensify the wild mushroom flavor, then stir in the tomatoes and parsley.

Cut the chicken into bite-size chunks or slices and add to sauce.  Simmer sauce 5 minutes to finish cooking chicken pieces and to allow the flavors to combine.  Toss pasta with cacciatore and serve with crusty bread and grated cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tidbits:  Beef broth and stock is now available in resealable paper containers, which can be found on the soup aisle of your market.  These paper containers make storage of remaining broth easier; keep some on hand in your refrigerator.  Beef broth is used instead of chicken broth in this recipe because it pairs better with the beefy taste of portobello mushrooms.  The broth will make your cacciatore taste as if it simmered all day because it accents the mushroom taste well.

Depending on your brand, 1 large can of tomatoes can vary in weight from 28 to 32 ounces.  Use your favorite, but check to make sure the product is sugar free.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     romaine hearts -- torn or rough cut
  1              large  fennel bulb -- trimmed of
                        fronds and tops
     1/4                red onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Several sprigs flat-leaf parsley
                        Balsamic vinegar -- as needed
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Asiago or Parmigiano Reggiano -- shaved for garnish

Cut fennel bulb down the center, then again, quartering it.  Remove the core with angled cuts on each quarter bulb.  Thinly slice quarter bulbs across and add to salad bowl.  Combine romaine and fennel with parsley sprigs and red onion.

Place one fingertip over the top of balsamic vinegar to control the pour and splash a few tablespoons into the bowl.  Drizzle the salad generously with extra-virgin olive oil and toss lightly to coat salad evenly with vinegar and oil.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and top salads with curls of Asiago or Parmigiano, created by shaving cheese with your knife.

                             Sausage Calzones

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  raw Italian sweet sausage -- casing removed
                        A drizzle olive oil
  2               cups  ricotta
                        A handful flat leaf parsley -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        A handful grated Parmigiano -- plus extra,
                        for knots
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        = (or a couple pinches of ground nutmeg)
                        A few grinds black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped pimento
  2                     tubes prepared pizza dough - (10 oz ea)
  2               cups  shredded mozzarella
                        Garlic oil
                        = (1 or 2 cloves chopped and heated in
                        1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil)
  2               cups  Five Minute Spicy Marinara -- (see recipe)
                        = (or tomato sauce or pizza sauce) -- for dipping

Preheat oven to 425.

Brown sausage in a small skillet in a drizzle of olive oil.  Transfer the cooked crumbled sausage to a paper towel lined plate to drain.

Combine sausage with ricotta, parsley, garlic, Parmigiano, nutmeg, pepper, and pimento.  Roll out doughs and halve cross-wise.  Place a dough rectangle on a nonstick cookie sheet.  Use 1/2 cup mozzarella on half of each dough rectangle and pile a mound of filling on half of the total area.  Fold dough over and pinch edges to seal.  The result is a rectangular turnover.

For half-moon shaped calzones, trim excess dough.  Roll dough bits into strips, tie in knots and brush with garlic oil and cheese.  Garlic knots are fun to dip at the table.

Bake calzones 15 minutes or until golden all over.  Serve calzones with warm tomato, marinara, or pizza sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 calzones.

Cook's Note:  For an additional time saver, 2 packages precooked sausage crumbles, 8 ounces each, may be substituted for raw Italian sausage used in the above recipe.

<DirT>
Brown sausage in a small skillet in a drizzle of olive oil.  Transfer the cooked crumbled sausage to a paper towel lined plate to drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine sausage with ricotta, parsley, garlic, Parmigiano, nutmeg, pepper, and pimento.  Roll out doughs and halve cross-wise.  Place a dough rectangle on a nonstick cookie sheet.  Use 1/2 cup mozzarella on half of each dough rectangle and pile a mound of filling on half of the total area.  Fold dough over and pinch edges to seal.  The result is a rectangular turnover.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For half-moon shaped calzones, trim excess dough.  Roll dough bits into strips, tie in knots and brush with garlic oil and cheese.  Garlic knots are fun to dip at the table.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake calzones 15 minutes or until golden all over.  Serve calzones with warm tomato, marinara, or pizza sauce for dipping.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 calzones.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook&apos;s Note:  For an additional time saver, 2 packages precooked sausage crumbles, 8 ounces each, may be substituted for raw Italian sausage used in the above recipe.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICY SHRIMP ===
  2             pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        = (a couple of handfuls)
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed, peeled
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt -- more or less
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (a couple of generous drizzles)
                        === AGLIO OLIO ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (4 turns around pan in a light stream)
  1                     tin anchovy fillets - (2 oz)
  6              large  garlic cloves - (to 8) -- crushed, minced
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat leaf parsley
                        = (a couple of handfuls)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1              pound  spaghetti -- cooked to al dente
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Tomato And Onion Salad -- (see recipe)
                        Crusty bread

Combine shrimp with next 6 ingredients and toss to coat shrimp evenly.

Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, then add half of the shrimp.  Cook shrimp 3 minutes until pink and just firm.  Remove shrimp to a warm platter and repeat process with remaining shrimp.

Return pan to heat and reduce heat to medium-low.  Add 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil.  Add anchovies, garlic, and pepper flakes to oil.  Break up anchovies with a wooden spoon until they melt away into the oil and garlic mixture.

Toss spaghetti in the pan with parsley and the garlic oil, then season with a little coarse salt, to your taste.  Top servings of garlic and oil spaghetti with spicy shrimp and serve with Tomato and Onion Salad and crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Notes:  Prepare the shrimp while the pasta is cooking.

Prep your garlic and parsley for aglio olio and set them, as well as drained pasta and remaining ingredients all within arm's reach of your stove top.

The aroma will be intense!  Cooked anchovies have a salted-nutty (rather than fishy) taste that compliments the garlic as it sweetens and softens.

                        Spinach Artichoke Calzones

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  part skim ricotta
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        = (or a few pinches ground nutmeg)
                        A few grinds black pepper
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano -- plus extra,
                        for sprinkling
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- defrosted, and
                        squeezed dry
  1                can  quartered artichoke hearts - (15 oz) -- drained, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     tubes refrigerated pizza dough - (10 oz ea
  2               cups  shredded mozzarella
                        Garlic oil -- as needed
                        = (1 or 2 cloves chopped and heated in
                        1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil)
  2               cups  Five Minute Spicy Marinara -- (see recipe)
                        = (or tomato sauce or pizza sauce) -- for dipping

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Combine first 7 ingredients in a bowl.

Roll each pizza dough out on a cookie sheet, and halve each cross-wise.  Spread 1/2 cup mozzarella and up to 1/4 of filling on each rectangle.  Work on just half of the surface of each rectangle of dough, then fold dough over top of filling and pinch edges firmly to seal.  For a half-moon "pizza parlor" look to your calzones, mound filling into a half-moon shape, fold dough over top trim edges of dough to follow the rounded shape, then seal edges.

Tie strips of dough scraps in knots, brush with garlic oil and sprinkle with grated cheese.  Bake knots with calzones.

If your dough tears, remove a little of the filling and repair.  Repeat the process, spacing the calzones evenly on baking sheet.  Bake the calzones for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown all over.  Serve calzones with warm Five Minute Spicy Marinara or tomato or pizza sauce for dunking.

This recipe yields 4 calzones.

Cook's Note:  Freeze any remaining filling in a small plastic container and use it to stuff a chicken breast on another day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  to large baking potatoes, like russets -- washed
                        A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (1 turn around the pan)
  2                     shallots -- chopped
     1/2         pound  deli baked ham in 1/8"-thk slices -- cut 2"-thk strips
     1/2         pound  Gruyere -- shredded
  2        tablespoons  butter -- in small pieces
     1/2           cup  milk or half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme -- leaves only
                        = (about 6 thyme sprigs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Tossed and dressed salad
                        Dark bread
                        = (pumpernickel, multi-grain, or dark rye)
                        Butter

Rub potatoes with a drizzle of oil and pierce skins with the tines of a fork.  Microwave on high 12 minutes or until tender.

While the potatoes cook in the microwave, heat a small skillet over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and saute chopped shallots 2 to 3 minutes or until bits are just tender.  Set aside.

Cool potatoes for 5 minutes, split potatoes down the center, and scrape flesh into a bowl.  Set skins aside on a non-stick baking sheet.  Preheat broiler to high with oven rack 6-inches from the heat source.

To the cooked potato in the mixing bowl, add shallots, ham strips, grated cheese, butter, milk or half-and-half, thyme, and season with salt and pepper.  Mash mixture with a potato masher or dinner fork until mixture is combined, but not entirely lump-free.

Scoop mixture in even amounts into skins and broil 2 or 3 minutes to lightly brown stuffed potatoes on top.  Serve the halves of stuffed potatoes with salad, dark bread, and butter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  prepared stuffing - (to 6)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (1 turn around the pan)
  2             medium  carrots -- chopped
                        = (up to 2 cups of leftover baby carrots,
                        chopped)
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
  2             quarts  chicken stock
  1 1/2         pounds  light and dark cooked turkey meat -- diced
                        A handful of flat-leaf parsley leaves -- chopped
  1                cup  frozen peas or leftover prepared peas -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and transfer stuffing into a small baking dish.  Place dish in oven and reheat 12 to 15 minutes, until warmed through.

Heat a pot over moderate heat and add extra-virgin olive oil.  Work close to the stove and add vegetables as you chop.  If you are using fresh carrots, cut them into a small dice or slice thin.  If you are using leftover baby carrots, cut carrots into bite-size pieces.  Add celery and onion and lightly season vegetables with salt and pepper.  Add bay leaf and stock and bring liquid to a boil by raising heat.  Add turkey and reduce heat to simmer.  Simmer until any raw vegetables are cooked until tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the parsley, and peas, if using.

Remove stuffing from oven.  Using an ice cream scoop, place a healthy scoop of stuffing in the center of a soup bowl.  Ladle soup around stuffing ball.  Your soup will look like a chunky matzo ball soup.  Pull spoonfuls of stuffing away as you eat through your bowl of soup.

This recipe yields 2 quarts, 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                jar  roasted red peppers - (14 oz)
                        = (or 2 medium homemade roasted red
                        peppers)
     1/2         pound  smoked fresh mozzarella -- sliced thin
  1                     packaged 12"-dia thin-crust pizza shell
     1/2        medium  zucchini -- sliced very thin
                        into discs
                        = (think of pepperoni slices as a
                        guideline)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  dried Italian seasoning
                        Coarse salt -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

If you are using jarred red peppers, drain them very well and pat peppers dry with paper towels.  Place peppers in a food processor and pulse-grind into a paste.  Spread paste in a thin layer on a thin crust shell.  Top paste with thin slices of smoked fresh mozzarella cheese.

Place very thinly sliced zucchini discs in a small bowl and combine with remaining ingredients.  Toss discs well to evenly coat with seasonings.  The zucchini discs will have a flavor similar to pepperoni.  You have just made zucchinironi!

Arrange your zucchinironi slices around your pie: as little or as much as you like, but do not overlap slices or you pie will be wet.

Bake directly on oven rack or on a preheated, perforated pizza pan.  Bake 10 minutes on the middle rack of preheated oven or, until cheese is bubbly and golden and edges of pizza are crisp.

This recipe yields one 12-inch pizza.

Tidbits:  How to roast red peppers: To roast in your oven, preheat broiler to highest setting.  Halve red peppers and rip out seeds.  Place pepper halves, skin-side up, on a cookie sheet.  Broil peppers until the skins are completely black.  Leave the oven door ajar while peppers roast to let steam escape.  Place blackened peppers in a large brown paper sack and close tightly.  Let peppers stand 10 minutes or until cool enough to handle.  Peel skins away from red pepper flesh, and discard skins.  To roast peppers on the outdoor grill, leave peppers whole and roast covered over high heat on a gas stove or close to coals.  Follow above method to peel.

If your market does not carry smoked fresh mozzarella cheese, you can substitute 1 1/2 cups of shredded smoked Gouda (the yield of grating about 8 ounces of cheese).
