  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream
  1              large  egg yolk
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  shelled natural unsalted pistachios -- (abt 2 oz)
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds -- (abt 2 oz)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  9              large  apricots -- halved, pitted
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  apricot jam
  2          teaspoons  water
                        Chopped pistachios

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add cream and egg yolk.  Using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball.  Press over bottom and up sides of 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Filling:  Combine pistachios, almonds, and sugar in processor.  Blend until nuts are finely ground.  Add butter and blend to paste consistency.  Using on/off turns, mix in egg and both extracts.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before using.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake chilled crust until light golden, pressing any bubbles with back of fork, about 18 minutes.  Cool crust on rack 15 minutes.

Spread filling evenly in crust.  Arrange apricot halves, cut-side down, close together in concentric circles atop filling, fitting in as many as possible.  Bake tart until filling is lightly browned and set and apricots are tender, about 55 minutes.  Cool tart completely on rack.

For Glaze:  Combine jam and 2 teaspoons water in heavy small saucepan.  Simmer over medium-low heat 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Strain glaze into small bowl.  Push up pan bottom to release tart.  Place tart on platter.  Brush glaze over tart.  Sprinkle chopped pistachios around edge of tart.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Frangipane is a classic pastry filling with ground almonds.  Here, pistachios are also added.  Both the pastry and the filling can be made one day before baking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  French bread - (1/4 of 1-lb loaf) -- crusts removed,
                        and bread torn into pieces
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  purchased unseasoned dry breadcrumbs
  6        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
     1/4           cup  drained capers
  6                     anchovy fillets -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- halved
  6             medium  artichokes
  2                     garlic cloves -- halved

Place bread in medium bowl.  Pour warm water over; soak 5 minutes.  Drain, then squeeze bread dry.  Return bread to same bowl.  Add 1/2 cup oil, purchased breadcrumbs, mint, capers, anchovies, and chopped garlic; blend well.  Season stuffing with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Fill large bowl with water.  Squeeze in juice from lemon.

Cut off all but 1 1/2 inches of stem from 1 artichoke.  Peel stem with vegetable peeler.  Starting at bottom of artichoke, snap off outer 3 rows of leaves.  Cut off top 1/3 of artichoke.  Spread leaves, exposing center.  Remove center leaves and bristly choke.  Place artichoke in lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Pour cold water into 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Add halved garlic.

Drain artichokes.  Pack centers with stuffing.  Place artichokes, stuffed-side down, in prepared dish.  Drizzle with 1/4 cup oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover dish.

Bake until tester inserted into artichoke bottoms meets no resistance, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Place artichokes on platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Mint and capers grow everywhere on Sicily, and anchovies are always available.  Here they enhance another island crop: artichokes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  cake flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  14       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 3/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6        tablespoons  ice water -- more or less
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
                        === FILLING ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  3               cups  fresh raspberries
  3               cups  fresh blackberries
                        Additional sugar -- (optional)

For Crust:  Combine first 5 ingredients in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter and blend, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 5 tablespoons water and vinegar.  Using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form, adding more water if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Shape each half into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray 9-inch-diameter glass baking dish with nonstick spray.  Whisk 3/4 cup sugar and cornstarch in large bowl to blend.  Add berries and toss to coat.  Let stand 10 minutes, tossing occasionally.

Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round; transfer to prepared pie dish.  Spoon filling into dough-lined dish.  Roll out second dough disk to 13-inch round.  Drape dough over filling, and trim overhang to 1/2 inch.  Press edges together to seal; fold overhang under and crimp decoratively.  Cut several small slashes in top crust to vent.  Sprinkle with additional sugar, if desired.

Bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, about 50 minutes; cool 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This pie has an exceptionally flaky crust.  It's wonderful -- of course -- with vanilla ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CURD ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  fresh lime juice
  4              large  egg yolks
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lime peel
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream -- more or less
  1              large  egg yolk
                        === TOPPING ===
  3                     baskets blueberries - (1/2 pint ea)
  1         tablespoon  sugar

For Curd:  Whisk sugar and lime juice in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Whisk in yolks, then butter.  Cook over medium-low heat until thick, smooth, and just beginning to bubble, stirring constantly, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Mix in lime peel.  Transfer to small bowl.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd.  Refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 4 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor 5 seconds.  Add butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons cream and egg yolk.  Using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form, adding more cream by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Shape dough into log.  Cut crosswise into 8 equal rounds.  Press each round over bottom and up sides of 3 3/4- by 3/4-inch tartlet pan with removable bottom.  Pierce crusts with fork.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Topping:  Place 1/2 cup berries and sugar in heavy small saucepan.  Using fork, mash berries coarsely.  Cook mixture over medium heat until beginning to simmer, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Using rubber spatula, push as much of mixture as possible through strainer set over medium bowl.  Mix remaining blueberries into strained berries.  Set topping aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake tartlet crusts until lightly golden, pressing any bubbles with back of fork, about 15 minutes.  Cool crusts completely on rack.

Spread curd in crusts.  Spoon blueberry topping over.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours or refrigerate up to 1 day.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The curd can be prepared up to four days ahead; the assembled tartlets, one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chilled unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1              large  egg
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  cherry preserves
     1/2           cup  chopped dried Bing (sweet) cherries -- (abt 2 1/2 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/4           cup  unsalted natural pistachios -- chopped
                        === GLAZE ===
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  sugar

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles fine meal.  Add egg and process just until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Flatten each half into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill until firm enough to roll, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Filling:  Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Mix preserves, chopped cherries, peel, and almond extract in medium bowl.

Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 11-inch round.  Transfer round to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Press dough gently into pan; trim overhang even with top of pan sides.  Spread filling in crust; sprinkle with pistachios.

Roll out second dough disk on lightly floured surface to 11-inch round; cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips.  Arrange several strips, spaced 3/4-inch apart, over filling.  Top with more strips at slight angle, forming lattice.  Press strip ends to edge of pan, trimming overhang.

For Glaze:  Beat egg and whole milk in small bowl to blend.  Brush some of glaze over lattice crust; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar.

Bake tart until crust is golden brown and cherry filling is bubbling thickly, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Cool tart completely in pan on rack.  (Tart can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  From Malta -- This thin, cookie-like tart with a lattice crust is offered on a feast day that commemorates the birth of the Virgin Mary and the exit of the Turks in 1565.

                        and halved
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  kirsch (clear cherry brandy)
     1/3           cup  cherry jam
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  kirsch

For Biscuits:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend.  Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Mix in chocolate.  Beat milk and egg in small bowl to blend.  Gradually add milk mixture to dry ingredients, tossing until dough comes together in moist clumps.

Gather dough together.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and gently knead 5 turns to combine.  Shape gently into 8-inch-long log.  Cut log crosswise into 8 rounds; shape each into 2 1/2- by 3/4-inch rounds.  Arrange rounds on prepared baking sheet.

Bake biscuits until bottoms are golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool on rack 15 minutes.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap in foil and rewarm in 350 degree oven 10 minutes before continuing.)

For Cherries:  Combine cherries, sugar, and kirsch in medium bowl.  Let stand until sugar dissolves and juices form, tossing occasionally, about 3 hours.  Strain cherry juices into heavy medium saucepan.  Mix in jam.  Cook over medium heat until jam melts and juices form thick syrup, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Mix syrup into cherries.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

For Topping:  Beat cream, sugar, and kirsch in large bowl until peaks form.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours.

Cut warm biscuits horizontally in half.  Place bottom halves in shallow bowls.  Spoon cherry mixture and cream over.  Cover with biscuit tops and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                         Cinnamon-Sugar Plum Cake

Recipe By     :Susan Haskell, Boston, MA
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  5              large  plums - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- pitted, and
                        cut into 1/2" wedges
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan.

Whisk first 3 ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in 3/4 cup sugar.  Add eggs 1 at a time, then lemon juice and lemon peel, beating until blended after each addition.  Beat in flour mixture.  Spread batter in prepared pan.

Press plum wedges halfway into batter in concentric circles, spacing slightly apart.  Mix remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon in small bowl; sprinkle over plums.

Bake until cake is browned on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Cut around cake; release pan sides.  Serve cake warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  I'm a social worker running my own practice.  In addition, I'm getting a doctorate in social work.  So most of my time is spent either working with patients or writing my dissertation.  Still, no matter what's on my schedule, nothing can stop me from going into the kitchen.  During the week, I make the time to pore over food magazines to find recipes I want to try.  On Saturdays, I cook for friends -- because next to cooking, sharing the results is my favorite thing to do.

This can also be made with fresh cherries, sliced peaches, nectarines, or pears.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- or more if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
     3/4           cup  warm water
                        Additional olive oil
  2               cups  grated Manchego or
                        pecorino Romano cheese -- more or less

Stir flour and salt in large bowl to blend.  Using rubber spatula, mix in 1/4 cup oil, then egg.  Gradually stir in 3/4 cup warm water to form soft dough.  Knead in bowl until smooth and elastic, flouring lightly if necessary, about 5 minutes.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.

Cut dough into 4 equal pieces; cover 3 pieces with plastic.  Roll out remaining piece on work surface to 13-inch rope.  Cut rope into 10 equal pieces.  Roll 1 piece at a time into 5-inch rope.  Dip fingers in oil and flatten rope to 1-inch-wide ribbon.  Roll ribbon tightly into coil.  Stand coil up on 1 end.  Flatten slightly and roll out coil to 3-inch-diameter round.  Cover round with plastic.  Repeat with remaining dough, covering rounds with plastic to prevent drying.

Pour enough oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan; heat oil to 350 degrees.  Fry dough rounds in batches until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer pancakes to paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle warm pancakes with cheese.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 40 pancakes.

Comments:  Cracker-like pancakes are a nice snack.

                     Fricassee Of Lobster With Pasta

Recipe By     :Chef GÈrard Lorenzoni Salini
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped shallots - (abt 9)
  2        tablespoons  Cognac or brandy
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  angel hair pasta

Cook lobsters in large pot of boiling salted water 4 minutes (lobsters will not be completely cooked through).  Working over bowl to collect juices, twist off lobster heads to separate from tails.  Cut heads in half lengthwise.  Cut tails into thick medallions (do not remove shells).  Crack claws but leave intact.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add lobster with shells and juices and Cognac and ignite carefully.  Cover skillet to extinguish flame.  Add wine and simmer 3 minutes.  Add cream and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat.  Cover to keep warm.

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Transfer to platter.  Spoon lobster with sauce over pasta and serve.

This recipe yields 4 first-course servings.

Comments:  The Hotel Le Maquis and its restaurant, L'Arbousier, are the labor of love of one remarkable woman, Catherine Salini.  She bought the land many decades ago and built this charming inn very close to where she grew up in Porticcio.  The rooms are decorated with antiques (personally selected and purchased by Salini), and the walls are hung with paintings by local artists.  It's a true pleasure to dine on L'Arbousier's terrace just above the beach, with its wonderful views of the bay.  Here you can taste the famous sardines stuffed with Swiss chard and brocciu (a local cheese), prepared by chef GÈrard Lorenzoni Salini, Catherine's son.  Another favorite dish is this lobster fricassee, which evokes the sunny splendor of this island treasure.

Comments:  The Hotel Le Maquis and its restaurant, L&apos;Arbousier, are the labor of love of one remarkable woman, Catherine Salini.  She bought the land many decades ago and built this charming inn very close to where she grew up in Porticcio.  The rooms are decorated with antiques (personally selected and purchased by Salini), and the walls are hung with paintings by local artists.  It&apos;s a true pleasure to dine on L&apos;Arbousier&apos;s terrace just above the beach, with its wonderful views of the bay.  Here you can taste the famous sardines stuffed with Swiss chard and brocciu (a local cheese), prepared by chef GÈrard Lorenzoni Salini, Catherine&apos;s son.

     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                     French-bread baguette - (18" long) -- cut crosswise

     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour

Comments:  I'm a social worker running my own practice.  In addition, I'm getting a doctorate in social work.  So most of my time is spent either working with patients or writing my dissertation.  Still, no matter what's on my schedule, nothing can stop me from going into the kitchen.  During the week, I make the time to pore over food magazines to find recipes I want to try.  On Saturdays, I cook for friends -- because next to cooking, sharing the results is my favorite thing to do.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  ripe tomatoes - (abt 8 oz ea)
     2/3           cup  polenta (coarse cornmeal)
     2/3           cup  fine yellow cornmeal
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Cut thin slice from each end of each tomato.  Discard ends.  Cut each tomato crosswise into 3 thick slices.

Mix polenta, fine cornmeal, Parmesan cheese, cayenne, and salt in medium bowl.  Dredge tomato slices thoroughly in cornmeal mixture.  Transfer to plate.

Pour enough oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1/4 inch.  Heat oil over medium heat.  Working in 2 batches, add tomatoes and cook until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer tomatoes to paper towels; drain.  Transfer tomatoes to platter and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  raisins
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed to paste
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  20                    baguette rounds, 1/2" thick
                        = (from 1 baguette)
  1              bunch  Swiss chard - (14 to 16 oz) -- thick stems trimmed
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped seeded tomato
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place raisins in small bowl.  Pour enough warm water over to cover; let stand 20 minutes.  Drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine 3 tablespoons oil and crushed garlic in another small bowl.  Arrange baguette rounds on baking sheet.  Bake until bread is crisp but not brown, turning bread once, about 5 minutes per side.  Cool.  Brush bread with garlic oil.

Cook Swiss chard in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Drain well.  Pat with paper towels to remove excess water.  Finely chop chard.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and minced garlic and sautÈ until onion is tender, about 3 minutes.  Add tomato and parsley and stir 1 minute.  Increase heat to high; add pine nuts, nutmeg, raisins, and chard and stir 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Top toasts with Swiss chard mixture.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 20 toasts.

Comments:  Although this mix of greens with pine nuts and raisins is typically a vegetable course, here it is placed on toasted bread rounds to serve as a tapa.  If you prefer it as a side dish, chop the chard very coarsely.

Increase heat to high; add pine nuts, nutmeg, raisins, and chard and stir 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top toasts with Swiss chard mixture.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 20 toasts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Although this mix of greens with pine nuts and raisins is typically a vegetable course, here it is placed on toasted bread rounds to serve as a tapa.  If you prefer it as a side dish, chop the chard very coarsely.

Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  egg yolks
  7        tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/4           cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Whisk yolks and 7 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until thick and pale yellow, about 2 minutes.  Bring cream to simmer in heavy small saucepan.  Gradually whisk hot cream into yolk mixture.  Whisk in Grand Marnier and vanilla; divide custard among six 3/4-cup custard cups.

Arrange cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal pan.  Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of cups.  Bake custards until gently set in center, about 25 minutes.  Remove cups from water and refrigerate uncovered until cold, at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)

Preheat broiler.  Place custards on baking sheet.  Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar onto each.  Broil until sugar starts to bubble and color, turning sheet often to prevent burning, about 2 minutes.  Chill until topping is hard and brittle, at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  As a kid, I'd accompany my mother to her job at the racetrack, where she would lead the horses out to the starting gate.  Eventually I was helping out in the stalls, and when I got older, I became a jockey.  My mother was also the person who, in a roundabout way, inspired my other passion: cooking.  I'd come home from school, and she would have prepared something from a box or can.  I didn't always like what was on the dinner table, so one day I asked her to buy me a cookbook.  Pretty soon I was making dinner for us almost every night.  Now, after seventeen years of racing horses and cooking for family and friends, I'm making the jump to professional cooking.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons -- halved
  6              large  artichokes
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint

Squeeze juice from halved lemons into large bowl filled with cold water.  Cut stem off 1 artichoke, leaving about 1 inch.  Snap off outer 2 rows of leaves.  Cut off top 1/3 of artichoke.  Quarter artichoke lengthwise.  Using small knife, cut out choke and prickly small leaves.  Place artichoke in lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Drain artichokes, add to pot, and boil until crisp-tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer artichokes to rack and cool.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk oil, 1/3 cup lemon juice, and mint in small bowl.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  Brush artichokes with dressing.  Grill until tender and lightly charred in spots, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Transfer artichokes to platter.  Drizzle with some of remaining dressing.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If the grill is large enough, cook the artichokes alongside the steaks; otherwise, grill these first and serve at room temperature.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  honey -- plus
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     container crËme fraÓche - (8 oz)
  6                     firm but ripe nectarines -- halved, pitted

Whisk 1/2 cup honey, vinegar, and vanilla in small bowl.  Whisk crËme fraÓche and remaining 2 tablespoons honey in medium bowl to blend.  (Glaze and crËme fraÓche mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately.  Refrigerate crËme fraÓche mixture.  Rewhisk both before using.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush nectarines generously with half of glaze.  Grill until heated through, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes.

Arrange 2 nectarine halves, cut-side up, on each plate.  Drizzle with remaining glaze.  Spoon some crËme fraÓche mixture into center of each nectarine half and serve.

Comments:  When using an outdoor grill, add a handful of fresh charcoal to the embers after serving the main course; when it's time to cook the nectarines, the fire should be at the right temperature.  Remember to brush the grill clean before adding the fruit.  Sour cream is a good substitute for the crËme fraÓche.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Grilled Striped Bass With Lemon And Fennel

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              whole  striped bass - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- cleaned
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh fennel fronds -- (packed)
  5                     lemon slices, 1/8" thick

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Whisk first 3 ingredients in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Make three 1/2-inch-deep diagonal slits in skin on each side of fish.  Brush fish generously inside and out with garlic oil.  Sprinkle fish inside and out with coarse salt.  Stuff slits with half of fennel fronds.  Place remaining fennel fronds inside fish.

Place fish in grilling basket.  Top fish with lemon slices, overlapping slightly.  Close grilling basket (fish and lemon slices should be secured by basket).  Grill fish until cooked through, about 10 minutes per side.

Remove fish with lemon slices from basket and carefully transfer to platter.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For best results, use a grill basket.  It should be big enough for the fish but snug enough to keep the fish and lemon slices from moving around.  The one we used in the Bon AppÈtit test kitchen was 17 by 6 inches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped bell peppers
                        = (mix of red, yellow, and green)
  4             ounces  Black Forest ham -- cut 1/2" dice
  1                cup  grated Swiss cheese

Whisk eggs, chives, salt, and pepper in medium bowl to blend.  Melt butter in large broiler-proof skillet over medium heat.  Add peppers and ham; sautÈ until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.

Preheat broiler.  Pour egg mixture over peppers and ham in skillet.  Cook over medium heat until bottom and edges are set, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Using spatula, carefully lift edges to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath.

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Lift edges 2 or 3 more times, allowing uncooked egg to flow underneath, until top is almost set, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle cheese over frittata.

Transfer skillet to broiler.  Broil until cheese is bubbling and eggs are set, about 1 minute.  Let frittata stand at least 1 minute and up to 1 hour.  Rewarm in microwave oven, if desired, or serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Highlight the homey flavors with boiled turnip greens splashed with vinegar and a basket of biscuits.  End with brown-sugar-sweetened peaches and sugar cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  honey
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     rack lamb - (1 1/2 lbs) -- trimmed
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  arugula - (abt 4 oz)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Combine honey, 1 tablespoon oil, and thyme in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over low heat until just warm.  Remove from heat.  Pour 2/3 of honey mixture into small bowl.

Place lamb on rack set in roasting pan; brush with half of honey mixture from bowl.  Roast lamb 12 minutes; brush with remaining honey mixture from bowl.  Continue to roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 10 minutes.  Transfer lamb to cutting board.

Meanwhile, add vinegar, 1 tablespoon water, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil to honey mixture in saucepan.  Stir over low heat until just warm.  Mix in nuts; discard thyme sprigs.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut lamb between ribs into chops.  Divide arugula among plates.  Top each serving with lamb chops.  Drizzle warm dressing over and serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 first-course or 2 main-course servings.

Comments:  Here, lamb chops are presented atop a salad that was inspired by the flavors of Sardinia.  A perfect first course or a light main course.

Transfer pork to platter; tent with foil.  Strain pan juices into 1-cup measuring cup; add enough broth to measure 1 cup liquid.  Pour into small saucepan; keep warm over low heat.

Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chard and toss to coat.  Cover and cook until chard is tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Mix in remaining lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread greens on platter.  Slice pork and arrange atop greens.  Pour pan juices over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  3 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  shallots -- chopped
  2               cups  arborio rice
                        = (or medium-grain white rice)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- (abt 3 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  4          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring broth to simmer in large saucepan over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low; cover to keep warm.

Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter with oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until tender, about 6 minutes.  Add rice; stir 1 minute.  Add wine and stir until evaporated, about 30 seconds.  Add 1 1/2 cups hot broth; simmer until absorbed, stirring frequently.  Add remaining broth 1/2 cup at a time, allowing broth to be absorbed before adding more and stirring frequently until rice is creamy and tender, about 35 minutes.

Stir in cheese and remaining 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in parsley, lemon juice, and lemon peel.  Season risotto with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Lemon juice and peel offer a double punch of flavor in this delicious dish.  Serve the risotto Italian-style as a first course, or American-style as a main course.

                  Lobster Stew With Tomatoes And Peppers

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     live lobsters - (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs ea)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2             medium  Hungarian yellow wax peppers -- finely chopped
                        = (or 1 large green bell pepper)
  1 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  5        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/4           cup  brandy
  1             bottle  clam juice - (8 oz)
  1                cup  water
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Working in batches and using tongs, lower lobsters into large stockpot of rapidly boiling water.  Boil 5 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer lobsters to platter.  Cool completely.

Working over bowl to catch juices from lobsters and using kitchen shears, cut tails from lobsters.  Cut each tail into 3 rounds.  Split open lobster heads and bodies; remove tomalley (green liver) and reserve (about 2 tablespoons total).  Divide each large claw into 2 pieces, cutting 1 side open for easy removal of claw meat.  Set aside lobster pieces and juices.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large deep skillet or pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and peppers; sautÈ until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, bay leaf, thyme, and pinch of sugar.  Sprinkle with salt.  Bring to boil.

Reduce heat and simmer until mixture thickens, about 20 minutes.  Add brandy and simmer 2 minutes.  Add all reserved lobster pieces and juices to skillet; simmer 5 minutes.  Mix in clam juice and 1 cup water.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer 10 minutes longer.

Add reserved tomalley, 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, and minced garlic to skillet with lobster and simmer uncovered 5 minutes.  Transfer lobster pieces to bowl.

Transfer sauce to blender and puree until smooth, thinning with more water if desired.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer sauce to serving bowl.  Top with lobster pieces.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A classic of the Balearic Islands, where lobster is found in abundance, this stew (known as caldereta) is intensely flavorful and fun to eat.  Live lobster is essential, since the tomalley (liver) is a key ingredient.  Serve the stew with plenty of crusty country-style bread.

Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain.  Add to sauce and toss to coat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer pasta to bowl.  Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  An interesting mix of spices lends wonderful flavor to this simple pasta dish -- known as pastitsada -- from Tavern Tripa.

Comments:  As owner and chef of Il Giardino restaurant, I've been cooking professionally for twenty-five years -- but I've been cooking for pleasure for a good fifty years.  As is the Italian way, most of my favorite recipes were handed down from my mother and grandmother, so they date from the early 1900s.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and cut into 3/4" pieces
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2             medium  red bell peppers
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2             medium  zucchini -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds
  4             medium  tomatoes -- chopped
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2                     anchovy fillets -- drained, chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place eggplant pieces in large colander set over bowl.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt.  Let stand 1 hour.  Pat eggplant dry with paper towels; set aside.

Add bell peppers; cook uncovered 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Chill.  Rewarm before continuing.)

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over low heat.  Add anchovies, oregano, and remaining parsley; stir 1 minute.  Add to vegetable mixture.  Stir in olives.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ALMOND CREAM FILLING ===
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2              large  eggs
     1/2                roll almond paste - (7-oz roll) -- diced
                        = (a scant 1/2 cup packed)
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
     2/3           cup  chilled heavy whipping cream
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  5              large  eggs -- separated
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1                cup  raspberry preserves
                        === ALMOND CREAM CHEESE FROSTING ===
  2 1/2       packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  almond extract
                        Assorted fresh berries
                        = (such as strawberries and blueberries)
                        Currant jelly -- warmed

For Almond Cream Filling:  Pour half-and-half into medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and bring cream to simmer.  Remove from heat; cover and steep 15 minutes.

Blend sugar and flour in medium bowl.  Whisk in eggs, then warm half-and-half mixture; return to same pan.  Add almond paste.  Whisk over medium heat until almond paste dissolves and custard boils, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Add white chocolate and butter; whisk until melted and smooth.  Press plastic wrap onto custard; chill 3 hours.  Remove vanilla bean.  Beat cream to peaks; fold into custard in 3 additions.  Cover; chill at least 6 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter and flour two 10-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.  Sift flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt into large bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup lukewarm water into dry ingredients; beat in oil, egg yolks, both extracts, and peel.  Using clean dry beaters, beat whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into batter in 3 additions.  Measure 4 2/3 cups batter into 1 prepared pan and 3 1/3 cups batter into second pan.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes for thinner cake and 30 minutes for larger cake.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Cut around cakes and turn out onto racks; cool completely.

Place thinner cake on 9-inch-diameter tart pan bottom.  Spread with 1/2 cup preserves, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Spoon 1 1/2 cups filling in dollops atop preserves; spread evenly.  Chill until filling is firm, about 15 minutes.

Cut larger cake horizontally in half.  Place 1 half, cut-side down, atop chilled filling.  Spread with 1/2 cup preserves, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Spoon 1 1/2 cups filling in dollops atop preserves; spread evenly.  Top with remaining cake layer, cut-side down.  Cover cake and remaining filling; chill 3 hours.

For Almond Cream Cheese Frosting:  Beat cream cheese, butter, sugar, and both extracts in large bowl to blend.  Beat in 3/4 cup remaining filling.  Spread 1 cup frosting thinly over sides and top of cake.  Spread cake with remaining frosting, building high rim around top edge.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and chill.)

Mound berries on top of cake.  Brush top of berries with warm jelly to glaze.  Serve immediately, or chill up to 6 hours.

This recipe yields 14 servings.

For Almond Cream Filling:  Pour half-and-half into medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and bring cream to simmer.  Remove from heat; cover and steep 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Blend sugar and flour in medium bowl.  Whisk in eggs, then warm half-and-half mixture; return to same pan.  Add almond paste.  Whisk over medium heat until almond paste dissolves and custard boils, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add white chocolate and butter; whisk until melted and smooth.  Press plastic wrap onto custard; chill 3 hours.  Remove vanilla bean.  Beat cream to peaks; fold into custard in 3 additions.  Cover; chill at least 6 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter and flour two 10-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.  Sift flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt into large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup lukewarm water into dry ingredients; beat in oil, egg yolks, both extracts, and peel.  Using clean dry beaters, beat whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into batter in 3 additions.  Measure 4 2/3 cups batter into 1 prepared pan and 3 1/3 cups batter into second pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes for thinner cake and 30 minutes for larger cake.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Cut around cakes and turn out onto racks; cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place thinner cake on 9-inch-diameter tart pan bottom.  Spread with 1/2 cup preserves, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Spoon 1 1/2 cups filling in dollops atop preserves; spread evenly.  Chill until filling is firm, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut larger cake horizontally in half.  Place 1 half, cut-side down, atop chilled filling.  Spread with 1/2 cup preserves, leaving 1/2-inch plain border.  Spoon 1 1/2 cups filling in dollops atop preserves; spread evenly.  Top with remaining cake layer, cut-side down.  Cover cake and remaining filling; chill 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Almond Cream Cheese Frosting:  Beat cream cheese, butter, sugar, and both extracts in large bowl to blend.  Beat in 3/4 cup remaining filling.  Spread 1 cup frosting thinly over sides and top of cake.  Spread cake with remaining frosting, building high rim around top edge.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mound berries on top of cake.  Brush top of berries with warm jelly to glaze.  Serve immediately, or chill up to 6 hours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1              large  egg white
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds -- lightly toasted,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  shelled unsalted pistachios -- chopped

Stir 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil, without stirring, 1 minute.

Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat egg white with pinch of salt in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually pour hot syrup over egg white mixture, beating constantly.  Continue beating meringue until very stiff, about 4 minutes.  Let stand until cool, about 10 minutes.

Beat cream in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Fold into honey meringue.  Fold in chopped nuts.  Spoon mixture into 11- by 7- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Keep frozen.)  Spoon ice cream into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Although nougat is made on many Mediterranean islands, the honey-and-nut confection is a real favorite on Minorca.

  2             pounds  meaty lamb neck and shoulder stew bones
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              large  leek, white and pale green parts only -- chopped

  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/4      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  4               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LAMB ===
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  minced shallots - (3 large)
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1 1/2           cups  fresh breadcrumbs -- or more if needed
                        = (made from French bread)
  8             ounces  Kalamata olives -- pitted, chopped
                        fine
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     well-trimmed racks of lamb -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea)
  4 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard

For Sauce:  Sprinkle lamb bones with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add lamb bones and sautÈ until dark brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer lamb bones to bowl.

Add leek, carrot, and onion to same pot.  SautÈ until golden, about 12 minutes.  Add tomato, red wine, garlic, bay leaves, and rosemary; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Add 4 cups water and lamb bones with any accumulated juices.  Bring to boil.  Cover partially, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened and reduced, about 2 hours.

Using tongs, discard lamb bones.  Press vegetables and liquid through sieve into large bowl.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)

For Lamb:  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and rosemary; sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add breadcrumbs and sautÈ until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add olives and stir until moist clumps form, adding more breadcrumbs if mixture is loose.  Season crumb topping with salt and pepper.  Cool.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Working in batches, add lamb racks to skillet, rounded-side down.  Sear until brown, about 6 minutes.  Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet, seared-side up.  Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons mustard over each.  Press crumb topping into mustard.  Roast lamb to desired doneness, about 25 minutes for medium.

Rewarm sauce over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Cut lamb between bones and serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The divine lamb dish featured here is a perfect example of the excellent food served at El Olivo.  This romantic restaurant, in a restored olive-oil mill, is a great spot to wine and dine someone special -- the many wax-drenched candelabra are very nice touches.  Service is impeccable, friendly, and attentive, including a sommelier at the ready to pair Spanish wines with the delicious local cuisine.  El Olivo is one of three restaurants located in La Residencia, a beautiful resort in the western Majorca town of Dei‡.

Serve this refined Spanish dish as they do at the restaurant, with sautÈed purple potatoes, mushrooms, baby carrots, and broccoli.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  25                    gingersnap cookies - (abt 6 oz) -- coarsely broken
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  4              small  peaches - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced 1/4" thick
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  4           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  peach preserves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2         large  peach -- peeled, pitted,
                        and very thinly sliced

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grind gingersnaps in processor to coarse crumbs.  Add butter and blend until evenly moistened.  Press crumbs over bottom and 1 inch up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Bake crust until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.  Cool on rack.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.

For Filling:  Combine peaches, 2 tablespoons sugar, and lemon juice in heavy large saucepan.  Cover and cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and peaches are juicy, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Uncover and cook until peaches are tender and juices thicken, about 5 minutes.  Cool compote.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar and beat until smooth.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time.  Mix in sour cream and vanilla.  Spoon half of cheese mixture (about 3 cups) into crust.  Spoon peach compote over by tablespoonfuls, spacing apart.  Top with remaining cheese mixture.

Place large piece of foil on oven rack.  Place pan with cheesecake on foil.  Bake until puffed, set in center, and beginning to brown, about 1 hour.  Place hot cheesecake on rack; cool 5 minutes.  Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen.  Place cheesecake, uncovered, on rack in refrigerator and chill overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)

For Glaze:  Combine preserves and lemon juice in heavy small saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until glaze comes to simmer.  Strain into small bowl.  Release pan sides; place cheesecake on platter.  Spread glaze over top of cheesecake to within 1/4 inch of edge.  Chill cheesecake until glaze sets, at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.  Arrange peach slices in center of cake and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This New York-style cheesecake -- with a hidden layer of sweet peach compote -- is an ideal do-ahead dessert.  It also travels well: Just glaze the cake in its pan and chill.  When ready to serve, release the sides, then top the cake with fresh peach slices.  Begin preparing this at least one day in advance.

     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  vodka
     3/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper

                        meat shredded into bite-size strips
     1/4           cup  freshly grated Parmesan cheese

  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves
  4                     strips orange peel - (ea 2" long)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  honey

                        Potato And Tuna Turnovers

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  2              large  eggs
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                can  tuna packed in oil - (6 oz) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  reserved oil from tuna
     3/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
  18                    sheets frozen phyllo pastry -- thawed
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
                        Additional vegetable oil -- for frying

Place potatoes, whole eggs (do not crack), and 1 teaspoon salt in heavy large pot.  Add enough cold water to cover.  Partially cover pot.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Remove eggs.

Continue simmering until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes longer.  Drain.  Transfer potatoes to large bowl.

Crack eggs; remove shells.  Add eggs to bowl with potatoes.  Using fork, coarsely mash potatoes and eggs.  Mix in tuna, reserved tuna oil, green onions, capers, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt; set aside.

Line 2 baking sheets with plastic wrap.  Stack phyllo sheets on work surface.  Using shears and a 9-inch plate as a guide, cut phyllo into 18 rounds.

Working quickly, stack 3 phyllo rounds on work surface.  (Cover remaining phyllo sheets with plastic, then damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.)  Place generous 1/4 cup filling in center of phyllo.  Sprinkle with 1/6 of parsley.  Brush edge with oil.  Fold phyllo to form half-moon, pressing slightly.  Fold edge over, pressing to seal.  Transfer turnover to baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining phyllo, filling, parsley, and oil.

Line baking sheet with 3 paper towels.  Pour oil into large skillet to depth of 1/2 inch.  Heat oil to 350 degrees.  Slide 1 turnover into oil.  Fry until bottom is golden, about 1 minute.

Using slotted spatula, transfer turnover onto plate; turn over.  Slide back into oil.  Fry until bottom is golden, about 1 minute.  Drain on baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining turnovers.

This recipe yields 6 turnovers.

Comments:  This recipe for breiks comes from Kitty Morse, the celebrated expert on North African cuisine.  She serves them with lemon and harissa paste, available at Middle Eastern Markets.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (17-oz pkg) -- thawed
  2              large  Bosc pears -- peeled, halved,
                        cored, cut lengthwise 1/8"-thk slices
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
  4        tablespoons  sugar
                        Vanilla ice cream
                        Brandy

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out 1 pastry sheet on floured work surface to 1/8-inch thickness.  Using 6-inch plate as aid, cut out 2 rounds.  Repeat rolling and cutting with second pastry sheet, forming 4 rounds total.

Place rounds on heavy large baking sheet, spacing apart.  Using 1 pear half for each tart, fan out pear slices in center of each round.  Brush tarts with melted butter; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon sugar.  Bake until pears are tender and pastry is golden, about 22 minutes.

Transfer tarts to plates.  Top each with ice cream and drizzle with brandy.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My husband, Ivan, and I moved to Corsica from Madagascar eleven years ago on a whim.  We restored an abandoned convent and saved the thousand-year-old olive grove surrounding it.  The fact that I live in the country -- with the luxury of having a garden full of wonderful ingredients -- makes it easy for me to love cooking.  I strive to teach my three little girls how to take pleasure in the simple, good things in life.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     frozen rabbit - (3 1/4 lbs) -- thawed, and
                        cut into 8 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  tomatoes -- chopped, with
                        seeds and juices - (abt 2 1/2 cups)
  1 1/3           cups  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary

Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat.  Sprinkle rabbit with salt and pepper.  Add rabbit to pot and sautÈ until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes and wine.  Bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until rabbit is cooked through, about 30 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer rabbit pieces to plate.  Add herbs to sauce in pot.  Simmer until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.  Return rabbit to pot.  Stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  To most Americans, Ischia, off the coast of Naples, is relatively unknown.  That's a shame, because for centuries this island's thermal springs have been luring savvy travelers for restorative dips; plus, the locals produce some of the best wine in the region.  At La Pergola, a family-run inn located on a hill just outside of Forio, guests enjoy some of that homemade wine, along with artisanal jams and olive oil.  La Pergola also serves one of the island's most popular dishes, rabbit cacciatore, or hunter's rabbit.

Chicken may be substituted for rabbit in this hearty dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STREUSEL ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted margarine - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
  4 1/2      teaspoons  ground cardamom
  2 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  matzo cake meal
                        === CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  matzo cake meal
     1/2           cup  potato starch
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  5              large  egg whites -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  liquid nondairy creamer
     1/4           cup  unsalted margarine - (1/2 stick) -- melted, cooled
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon peel
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     2/3           cup  raisins

For Streusel:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Coat 9- by 9-inch pan with 2-inch-high sides generously with margarine.

Mix 1/4 cup margarine, sugar and spices in medium bowl.  Gradually add matzo meal and mix until crumbly.  Spread half of streusel on baking sheet and bake until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.  Cool and break into bits.

For Cake:  Combine first 4 ingredients in small bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 1 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.

Using same beaters, beat egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in another bowl until mixture is thick and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted.  At low speed, beat in nondairy creamer, then margarine, lemon peel and lemon juice.  Add dry ingredients and stir until well blended.  Fold in egg whites in 2 additions.

Pour half of batter into prepared pan.  Sprinkle baked streusel over.  Sprinkle with half of raisins.  Spread remaining cake batter over.  Sprinkle with unbaked streusel and remaining raisins.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out dry, about 40 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack.  Cover with foil and let stand 1 hour to soften topping.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Keep covered and store at room temperature.)  Cut into squares and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  A spice cake that's great with coffee.

  24            ounces  fresh rhubarb -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces - (abt 5 cups)
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Comments:  "While my sister was visiting me, we had dinner at Asher Restaurant in nearby Roswell," writes Terry Taylor of Suwanee, Georgia.

Comments:  &quot;When I was staying at the Metropolitan Hotel in Toronto,&quot; writes Constance M. Shertzer of Indiana, Pennsylvania, &quot;I discovered a fabulous restaurant there called Hemispheres Restaurant and Bistro.  The pasta with mushrooms and tomato sauce was as good as any I&apos;ve ever had in Italy.&quot;

            Risotto Croquettes With Mozzarella And Prosciutto

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2        medium  onion -- chopped
  1 1/4           cups  arborio rice - (8 to 9 oz)
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  2               cups  finely-ground fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (from crustless Italian or French bread)
     2/3           cup  finely-diced whole-milk mozzarella cheese
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped prosciutto
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Bring broth to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Remove from heat and cover.  Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add onion and sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add rice; stir 1 minute.  Add wine and stir until absorbed, about 1 minute.  Add 1/2 cup broth and simmer until liquid is absorbed, stirring often.  Cook until rice is just tender and risotto is creamy, adding broth 1/2 cup at at time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next, about 25 minutes.  Mix in Parmesan.  Season risotto with salt and pepper.  Cool completely.  Mix in 1 egg.  Cover and chill.

Place some flour in 1 bowl; place remaining egg in another bowl and beat to blend.  Place breadcrumbs in third bowl.  Using moistened hands, shape 1/4 cup (packed) cold risotto into ball.  Poke hole in center.  Fill with 1 rounded teaspoon mozzarella and 1 teaspoon prosciutto.  Press risotto over filling.  Coat rice balls in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.  Place on rack to dry.  Repeat with remaining risotto, filling and coating.  Let rice balls stand at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.

Pour 1 1/2 inches oil into heavy medium pot.  Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 360 degrees.  Fry balls, 3 at a time, until golden and crusty, turning once, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 12 croquettes.

Comments:  These are called arancini (little oranges).

  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds -- plus
  2          teaspoons  coriander seeds
                        === RELISH ===
  4                     red bell peppers
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  fresh corn kernels
                        = (from about 4 ears)
  4                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        === SALMON ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  salt
  10                    skinless salmon fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea)
                        = (abt 1 3/4" thick each)

Toast coriander seeds in small skillet over medium heat until aromatic, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Crush in mortar with pestle.

For Relish:  Char bell peppers over gas flame or under broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel and seed peppers; cut into 1/2-inch pieces.  Set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add corn and green onions and sautÈ until corn begins to brown in spots, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and thyme; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add wine and stir until liquid evaporates, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bell peppers, lemon juice, honey, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Add 1 1/2 teaspoons crushed coriander seeds.  (Relish can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Stir over medium heat until heated through before serving.)  Stir parsley into relish.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

For Salmon:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Mix first 5 ingredients and remaining crushed coriander seeds in medium bowl.  Brush salmon all over with mixture.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Roast salmon until opaque in center, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Spoon relish over salmon and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

What to drink:  More Champagne or a fruity red, such as a young Rioja or a Sangiovese.

Comments:  Roasting is probably the easiest way to prepare salmon for a crowd; it requires minimal attention and ensures an effortlessly elegant presentation.

                        pasta] or medium pasta shells)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  saffron threads -- crumbled
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino Sardo cheese -- (abt 3 oz)
                        = (or pecorino Romano cheese)

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add pancetta; sautÈ until fat is rendered, about 3 minutes.  Add onion and parsley and sautÈ until onion is soft, about 5 minutes.  Add ground pork and sautÈ until brown, breaking up with back of fork, about 8 minutes.  Stir in crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, and sage.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens and flavors blend, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Chill uncovered 1 hour.  Then cover and keep chilled.  Rewarm over low heat.)

Meanwhile, bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Add pasta and saffron and cook until pasta is just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain.  Return pasta to pot.  Add sauce and 1/2 cup cheese and toss to blend.  Transfer to bowl.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  Malloreddus, the saffron-flavored pasta shaped like gnocchi, is a Sardinian specialty.  For convenience, we used dried pasta of a similar shape and added saffron to the pasta cooking water.

              Saute Of Fresh Fava Beans, Onions, And Fennel

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh fava beans -- shelled
                        = (or 3 cups thawed frozen
                        baby lima beans)
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                     fresh fennel bulb -- trimmed, sliced
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds -- coarsely ground
                        with a spice grinder
  1 1/3           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
     1/2           cup  chopped pancetta
     1/2      teaspoon  dried savory
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook fava beans in boiling salted water 2 minutes.  Drain, cool and peel outer skins (do not cook or peel l ima beans).

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and fennel bulb; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add favas or lima beans and fennel seeds; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add 1 cup broth and 2 tablespoons dill; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors.

Stir in pancetta and savory, adding more broth if mixture is dry.  Simmer until favas are tender, about 15 minutes longer.

Mix in lemon juice and 2 tablespoons dill.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  On the Cycladic islands, homemade salted pork flavors most vegetable dishes.  Pancetta makes a good substitute here.  Pancetta, Italian bacon cured in salt, is available at Italian markets, some supermarkets, and some specialty foods stores.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  uncooked medium to large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1 1/4           cups  Seafood Marinade -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced canned chipotle chilies -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Place shrimp in large bowl.  Add marinade and toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes.  Drain shrimp; discard marinade.  Return shrimp to bowl.

Puree 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 garlic clove, chipotle chilies, and dried oregano in processor until smooth.  Transfer chipotle mixture to bowl with shrimp; toss to coat.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add remaining garlic clove and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add shrimp with chipotle mixture; sautÈ until shrimp are cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to serving bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "I recently took out-of-town guests to Zarela in Manhattan for an authentic Mexican meal," writes Kelly Sfarra of Hawthorne, New York.  "Everything was fantastic, but the shrimp with chipotle chilies was especially memorable.  Can you please get the recipe?"

After a trip to Veracruz, Mexico, chef Zarela MartÌnez came up with this dish, which is called camarones enchipotlados at the restaurant.  A bowl of rice and some warm corn tortillas would be great with the spicy, smoky shrimp.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  grated whole-milk mozzarella cheese -- (abt 4 oz)
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino Sardo - (abt 3 oz)
                        = (or pecorino Romano cheese)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  7        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  room-temperature water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  room-temperature water -- more or less

Mix first 3 ingredients in medium bowl.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.

Whisk flour and salt in large bowl to blend.  Add shortening and rub in with fingertips until coarse meal forms.  Add olive oil and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water, mixing with fork until dough begins to clump together and adding more water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.

Turn dough out onto work surface and knead briefly until smooth, about 1 minute.  Divide in half; roll each half into 1 1/2-inch-diameter log.  Wrap logs in plastic and chill 1 hour.

Lightly oil baking sheet.  Cut each log crosswise into 14 rounds.  Roll out each round on floured surface to 3 1/2-inch round.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon cheese mixture in center of each of 14 rounds.  Brush dough edges lightly with water.  Cover each with another dough round.  Press edges firmly together, twisting edges of dough a little at a time so that sealed edges resemble thin rope.  Place turnovers on prepared sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Bake turnovers until pale golden, about 25 minutes.  Place on platter; serve immediately.

This recipe yields 14 turnovers.

Comments:  Called panadas, these little pastries make wonderful hors d'oeuvres.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             bottle  clam juice - (8 oz)
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  diced drained oil-packed
                        sun-dried tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  herbes de Provence -- see * Note
                        = (or salad herbs)
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lime peel
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed
  4                     red snapper fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea)
  8             ounces  angel hair pasta
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil
                        Additional minced orange peel

* Note:  A dried herb mixture available at specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.  If unavailable, a combination of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds can be substituted.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and garlic; sautÈ 30 seconds.  Add clam juice, cream, wine, orange juice, sun-dried tomatoes, lime juice, herbes de Provence, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon orange peel, and lime peel; boil until sauce is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  (Sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before using.)

Place flour in shallow dish.  Sprinkle snapper fillets with salt and pepper.  Dredge snapper in flour, turning to coat; shake off excess.  Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add snapper and cook until brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate.  Add sauce to skillet and bring to simmer.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain well.  Return pasta to pot.  Add half of sauce and toss to coat.

Divide pasta equally among 4 plates.  Top with snapper, then drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with basil and additional minced orange peel.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PLUMS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  plums -- halved, pitted,
                        and sliced 1/4" thick
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
                        === MERINGUES ===
  4              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  apple cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  chilled crËme fraÓche -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  sugar

* Note:  Sold at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 1/2 cups whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat and mix in 3 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover and let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

For Plums:  Combine all ingredients in large skillet; toss to coat.  Cover and cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Uncover and cook until plums are tender but still hold shape, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes longer; cool to room temperature.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Transfer to bowl.  Cover and chill.)

For Meringues:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl 1 minute.  Add cream of tartar.  Continue to beat until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, beating until whites are thick and resemble marshmallow creme, about 5 minutes.  Beat in cornstarch, vinegar, vanilla, and cardamom.  Drop meringue onto prepared sheet in 6 mounds, spaced 3 inches apart.  Using back of spoon, make depression in center of each.

Place meringues in oven.  Immediately reduce temperature to 250 degrees.  Bake until meringues are dry outside (but centers remain soft) and pale straw color and lift easily from parchment, about 50 minutes.  Cool on sheet on rack.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

For Topping:  Beat crËme fraÓche and sugar in medium bowl until peaks form.  Refrigerate up to 2 hours.

Place meringues on plates.  Spoon plum mixture into center depression.  Spoon topping and any plum juices over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pound  crabmeat -- well drained
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4               cups  mixed baby greens
     1/4           cup  bottled citrus vinaigrette
                        Lemon wedges

Line baking sheet with foil.  Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl.  Add crabmeat and stir gently to combine.  Shape mixture into eight 1/2-inch-thick cakes.  Transfer to prepared sheet.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Working in batches, cook crab cakes until bottoms are brown, about 4 minutes.  Using spatula, carefully turn cakes over and cook until second sides are brown, about 4 minutes longer.

Divide greens among 4 plates.  Drizzle with vinaigrette.  Top with crab cakes.  Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These crispy cakes are jazzed up with cayenne and lemon peel.  Add purchased potato salad, sliced tomatoes, and a seeded baguette.  A strawberry tart from the bakery would make a refreshing summer finish.

  2                     green onions -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Using small sharp knife, cut off peel, and white pith from oranges.  Cut oranges into 1/4-inch pieces.  Transfer to large bowl.

Add green onions, parsley, and crushed red pepper; toss to combine.  Season salad to taste with salt and pepper.  Drizzle with oil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Eremo della Giubiliana is a magical hotel near Ragusa in southeastern Sicily.  Housed in a converted fifteenth-century convent and with just nine guest rooms, it manages to combine serene simplicity with modern day pampering.  The high-beamed, airy restaurant underscores the feeling and complements the chef's fresh new takes on traditional foods.  Each dish of the five-course meal is simple, authentic, and utterly delicious.  This orange salad is a wonderful example: Made with the local blood oranges and olive oil, its flavors are both pure and distinctive.

Blood oranges make for an impressive and classic presentation, but navel oranges work just as well.

            Spicy Sauteed Fish With Olives And Cherry Tomatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2             pounds  tilapia, red snapper, or
                        orange roughy fillets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  4               cups  cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1                cup  Kalamata olives -- chopped
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Add half of fish to skillet and sautÈ until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer fish to platter.  Repeat with remaining fish.

Add parsley and crushed red pepper to same skillet; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes, olives, and garlic; sautÈ until tomatoes are soft and juicy, about 2 minutes.  Season sauce with salt and pepper; spoon over fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  As owner and chef of Il Giardino restaurant, on the tiny island of Ventotene off the coast of Naples, I've been cooking professionally for twenty-five years -- but I've been cooking for pleasure for a good fifty years.  As is the Italian way, most of my favorite recipes were handed down from my mother and grandmother, so they date from the early 1900s.

I love having so many amazing ingredients at my fingertips on Ventotene: fish, lentils, wild asparagus, mushrooms, fava beans, and artichokes.  They make it easy to produce home-style cooking at its best.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3               cups  sliced onions
  1              pound  cleaned squid -- tentacles left
                        whole, bodies crosscut into 1/2" rings
  1              pound  plum tomatoes -- chopped
  1                cup  dry red wine
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until golden, about 7 minutes.  Add squid and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add tomatoes, wine, basil, parsley, oregano, tomato paste, and crushed red pepper.  Simmer until squid is tender and sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Although I live in Athens, my connection to the islands is very strong -- my husband, Andreas, is from Crete, and we have a vacation home on the Greek island of Euboea in the Aegean Sea.  No matter where we are, we love to entertain our two children, our three grandchildren, and scores of friends.  For these get-togethers, I always prepare quick, simple dishes because my busy schedule demands it; I write children's and travel books, and I'm the general secretary of the National Society of Greek Writers.  I've often thought that cooking is like writing a story -- always best when you put your heart into it.

Rich and fragrant, this main course goes well with boiled potatoes or rice.

                        coarsely chopped - (abt 1/3 cup) -- see * Note 2
                        = (or 1 tbspn grated lemon peel)
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nam pla) -- see * Note 2
  3                     kaffir lime leaves
                        = (or 3 tbspns fresh lime juice
                        plus 1 1/2 tspns grated lime peel)
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  3             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  4                     plum tomatoes -- diced - (abt 1 cup)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

* Note 2:  Available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

Bring coconut milk to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium; add curry paste and whisk until dissolved.  Add next 6 ingredients.  Simmer uncovered 10 minutes.  Strain into bowl.

Heat peanut oil in large deep skillet over high heat.  Add mussels.  SautÈ 2 minutes.  Add strained curry sauce.  Cover and cook until mussels open, about 4 minutes (discard any mussels that do not open).  Transfer to large serving bowl.  Sprinkle with tomatoes and cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  "On a trip to the Northwest, I enjoyed dinner at Yarrow Bay Grill in Kirkland, Washington," writes Sue Eltringham of Prescott, Arizona.  "I'm a big fan of mussels and was especially fond of their version, with coconut-curry sauce.  I'd like to have the recipe so that I can enjoy it again before my next visit."

Rich coconut flavor and just the right amount of heat make this starter special.  A trip to an Asian market will likely yield most of the ingredients you need.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     skinless salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)

                        Chopped green onions

Mix sugar and next 3 ingredients in bowl.  Brush salmon with water to moisten.  Sprinkle salmon on both sides with all of sugar mixture.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add salmon and cook until crusty on outside and just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer salmon to plates.

Comments:  As a kid, I'd accompany my mother to her job at the racetrack, where she would lead the horses out to the starting gate.  Eventually I was helping out in the stalls, and when I got older, I became a jockey.  My mother was also the person who, in a roundabout way, inspired my other passion: cooking.  I'd come home from school, and she would have prepared something from a box or can.  I didn't always like what was on the dinner table, so one day I asked her to buy me a cookbook.  Pretty soon I was making dinner for us almost every night.  Now, after seventeen years of racing horses and cooking for family and friends, I'm making the jump to professional cooking.

  2              small  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  4               cups  day-old crustless French bread in 1" cubes
  6                     green onions -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  whole milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
     1/3           cup  tarama - (abt 4 oz) -- see * Note
                        = (pale orange carp roe)
  1              large  egg
  2              large  egg whites
  3               cups  fresh breadcrumbs
                        = (made from crustless French bread)
                        Olive oil -- for frying
                        Safflower oil -- for frying
                        Lemon wedges

* Note:  Tarama is available at Greek markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain.  Return to saucepan; mash.

Combine bread cubes, green onions, 1/2 cup milk, and tarama in processor.  Process until smooth paste forms.  Transfer mixture to bowl.  Add 1 whole egg and 1 cup mashed potatoes (reserve any remaining potato for another use); stir to blend well.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.

Lightly beat egg whites and remaining 2 tablespoons milk in medium bowl to blend.  Place breadcrumbs on plate.  Form 2 tablespoons tarama mixture into ball; press to flatten slightly.  Dip into egg-white mixture, then coat on both sides with breadcrumbs.  Repeat with remaining tarama mixture.

Pour equal amounts olive oil and safflower oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 1 inch.  Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of saucepan and heat oil over medium-high heat to 350 degrees.

Working in batches, add tarama croquettes to skillet and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Transfer croquettes to platter.  Serve hot, passing lemon wedges separately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Tarama, or carp roe caviar, is a favorite Kytheran ingredient.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  top sirloin -- cut crosswise
                        into thin strips
  2          teaspoons  Thai red curry paste
  4        tablespoons  Asian stir-fry oil
                        = (or peanut oil)
  12            ounces  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" lengths - (3 1/2 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  canned unsweetened coconut milk
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil
                        Lime wedges

Place beef and curry paste in medium bowl.  Stir to coat beef thoroughly.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over high heat.  Add asparagus and sautÈ until crisp-tender and beginning to char slightly, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer asparagus to bowl.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to skillet.  Add curry-coated beef in single layer.  Cook over high heat without stirring until bottom of beef begins to char slightly, about 2 minutes.  Add coconut milk and cook, stirring often, until sauce is bubbling and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Add asparagus and heat through.  Stir in basil.  Squeeze lime wedges over mixture and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serve this intensely flavored curry -- made with Thai red curry paste and coconut milk from the supermarket's Asian foods section -- over steamed jasmine rice.  A side salad of bean sprouts drizzled with Asian salad dressing would be a cooling accompaniment; follow it with mango slices.

Comments:  Serve this intensely flavored curry -- made with Thai red curry paste and coconut milk from the supermarket&apos;s Asian foods section -- over steamed jasmine rice.  A side salad of bean sprouts drizzled with Asian salad dressing would be a cooling accompaniment; follow it with mango slices.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  3        tablespoons  amaretto
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped toasted almonds -- plus
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped toasted almonds
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

Using handheld electric mixer, beat sugar, egg yolks, corn syrup, and amaretto in large metal bowl to blend.  Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Beat until candy thermometer registers 160 degrees and parfait base is thick and billowy, about 8 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Continue to beat parfait base until cool, about 7 minutes.  Fold in 1/2 cup almonds.

Beat cream and vanilla in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Fold cream into cool parfait base in 3 additions.  Transfer parfait to 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.  Scoop parfait into goblets.  Sprinkle with chocolate and 3 tablespoons almonds.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  As owner and chef of Il Giardino restaurant, on the tiny island of Ventotene off the coast of Naples, I've been cooking professionally for twenty-five years -- but I've been cooking for pleasure for a good fifty years.  As is the Italian way, most of my favorite recipes were handed down from my mother and grandmother, so they date from the early 1900s.

This rich dessert is called a semifreddo ("half frozen") in Italian.

                Tomatoes Stuffed With Spiced Lamb And Rice

Recipe By     :Yolanda Paterakis, Athens, Greece
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  firm tomatoes - (3" to 3 1/2" dia ea)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              pound  ground lamb
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4           cup  cooked long-grain white rice
                        = (abt 1/4 cup uncooked)
     1/4           cup  plain dry breadcrumbs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut off top third of tomatoes; chop tops and reserve.  Scoop out seeds, juice, and pulp from tomatoes and discard.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until tender and golden, about 8 minutes.  Add lamb and sautÈ until browned, about 7 minutes.  Add chopped tomato tops, wine, mint, 2 tablespoons parsley, and cinnamon.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until mixture thickens, stirring frequently, about 12 minutes.  Stir in cooked rice.

Place tomatoes in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spoon lamb mixture into tomatoes.  Sprinkle each tomato with 1/2 tablespoon breadcrumbs, then 1 tablespoon cheese.  Bake until heated through and cheese begins to turn golden, about 25 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  My husband, Andreas, is from Crete, and we have a vacation home on the Greek island of Euboea in the Aegean Sea.  No matter where we are, we love to entertain our two children, our three grandchildren, and scores of friends.  People often come over in the evening for mezedes and ouzo.  For these get-togethers, I always prepare quick, simple dishes because my busy schedule demands it; I write children's and travel books, and I'm the general secretary of the National Society of Greek Writers.  I've often thought that cooking is like writing a story -- always best when you put your heart into it.

  8        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
  2              large  shallots
  4                     garlic cloves
                        Salt -- to taste

                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1 1/2         pounds  red-skinned new potatoes
  1 1/2         pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes - (abt 1 1/2" dia ea)
  1              pound  purple potatoes - (abt 1 1/2" dia ea)
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Blend 4 tablespoons olive oil, basil, shallots, and garlic in processor until smooth.  Season basil sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray large baking sheet with nonstick spray.  Toss all potatoes with 4 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper in large bowl to coat.

Comments:  Farmers' markets offer the widest selection of fresh baby potatoes, but if you can't find golf-ball-size versions of any of the varieties in this recipe, simply purchase large potatoes and cut them into 1 1/2-inch pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     thick-cut bacon slices -- chopped
  1              pound  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1 3/4         pounds  veal scallops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/3           cup  dry vermouth
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme

Cook bacon in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to small bowl.

Add potatoes to drippings in skillet.  Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Transfer potatoes to medium bowl; cover to keep warm.  Reserve skillet.

Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper; coat with flour and shake off excess.  Add butter to skillet and melt over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, add veal to skillet and cook until brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer veal to platter.

Add broth, vermouth, garlic, and thyme to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Boil until sauce is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes.  Mix in bacon.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over veal.  Surround with potatoes; serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My husband, Ivan, and I moved to Corsica from Madagascar eleven years ago on a whim.  We restored an abandoned convent and saved the thousand-year-old olive grove surrounding it.  The fact that I live in the country -- with the luxury of having a garden full of wonderful ingredients -- makes it easy for me to love cooking.  I like to surprise my family and guests with unexpected flavor combinations that don't take a lot of effort.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  self-rising flour
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut small pieces,
                        and at room temperature
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1              large  egg -- blended with
  1         tablespoon  water
  9             ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated

Place flour, sugar, and cumin seeds in large bowl.  Add butter.  Using handheld mixer, beat until coarse crumbs form.  Beat in buttermilk and all but 1 tablespoon egg mixture.  Add 2/3 of cheddar cheese and beat just until incorporated.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Using floured hands, divide dough into 2 pieces.  Pat each piece into 7-inch-diameter round.  Brush rounds with reserved 1 tablespoon egg mixture.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese, dividing equally.

Cut each round into 6 wedges.  Transfer to large baking sheet, spacing 1/2 inch apart.  (Scones can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake scones until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes.  Let scones cool on baking sheet 10 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 scones.

Comments:  In these easy scones, cumin seeds complement the sharp cheddar, and self-rising flour eliminates the need for baking powder or baking soda.  If you prepare the dough the night before, you can just pop the scones into the oven when guests arrive.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1 3/4         pounds  zucchini -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/3"-thick rounds
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/3           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and sautÈ 10 seconds.  Add zucchini and 2 tablespoons cilantro; sautÈ until zucchini is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Add cream and simmer until juices thicken slightly, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My husband, Ivan, and I moved to Corsica from Madagascar eleven years ago on a whim.  We restored an abandoned convent and saved the thousand-year-old olive grove surrounding it.  Today we produce an olive oil called 'de pays de Corse Ivan Popoff.'

Although I was born in Lyons, the subtle flavors typical of Corsican cooking have definitely influenced my style.  My dishes are extremely varied and well thought-out, but most of all simple.  I like to surprise my family and guests with unexpected flavor combinations that don't take a lot of effort.

While this is delicious on its own as a side dish, HÈlËne also recommends it as a sauce spooned over roasted fish.
