             Balsamic-Grilled Radicchio With Shaved Pecorino

Recipe By     :Michael Presnal
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  4              large  radicchio heads -- each quartered
                        through core end
  1                cup  Pecorino Romano cheese shavings

Whisk oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, orange peel, and crushed red pepper in large bowl.  Add radicchio and toss to coat.  Marinate 15 minutes.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Drain marinade into small bowl.  Place radicchio on grill; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill radicchio until edges are crisp and slightly charred, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Transfer radicchio to serving platter.  Drizzle with reserved marinade and sprinkle with cheese shavings.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Chef Michael Presnal of The Federal Restaurant in Agawam, Massachusetts, writes: "The recipe here was featured on one of my first menus as a chef, before I got into the kind of complex cooking I do now at The Federal.  That was over ten years ago, but I still love making this dish at home.  It calls for just a few fresh ingredients and takes only a couple of steps."

Serve as a side dish or first course.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To make the cheese shavings, use a vegetable peeler to cut long strips from a wedge of Pecorino Romano.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (3 to 4 lbs)
  1                can  beer - (12 oz)

Apply your favorite spice rub, if desired, under and on skin of one 3- to 4-pound whole chicken.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

"Stand" the chicken onto an open beer can (filled halfway with beer or seasoned liquid from the article in the August issue) so that the can is inside the cavity.  Stand upright on grill.  Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat (see specifics below) until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 175 degrees.

For charcoal grill:  Rake hot coals to the sides and roast chicken over drip pan containing a half an inch of water for one hour.  Add 12 more briquets; leave uncovered until smoking.  Recover and continue cooking.

For gas grill:  Leave one burner off and put chicken over unlit burner for cooking time.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Here's a grilled chicken technique that's become a cult hit with backyard barbecue masters.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEEF ===
  1             bottle  beer - (12 oz)
     1/3           cup  pomegranate molasses*
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  dried crushed red pepper
  1                     tri-tip beef roast - (2 1/4 lbs) -- trimmed
                        === MUSHROOMS AND ONIONS ===
  2              large  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        dark gills scraped out
  8             ounces  large fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed
  6             ounces  oyster mushrooms
  1                     onion - (abt 12 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2"-thk rounds
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  beef broth
     1/4           cup  heavy whipping cream
  1                cup  crumbled blue cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh herbs

* A thick pomegranate syrup; sold at some supermarkets and Middle Eastern markets, and at adrianascaravan.com.

For Beef:  Combine first 5 ingredients in large heavy-duty resealable plastic bag; shake to blend and seal.  Chill overnight.

For Mushrooms And Onions:  Place mushrooms and onions on rimmed baking sheet.  Whisk oil, garlic, and vinegar in small bowl; season with salt and pepper.  Brush vegetables with some dressing.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill mushrooms and onions until tender and lightly browned, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Return vegetables to same baking sheet; cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips.

Boil all broth in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 12 minutes.  Add cream, mushrooms, and onions.  Boil until sauce coats vegetables, tossing occasionally, about 6 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Drain marinade from beef into medium saucepan; boil 2 minutes.  Cook beef over hottest part of grill until brown, about 5 minutes per side.  Move beef to coolest part of grill; cover and cook until thermometer inserted into center registers 135 degrees for medium-rare, turning occasionally and basting with marinade, about 30 minutes.  Transfer to cutting board; let rest 10 minutes.

Rewarm mushroom sauce.  Thinly slice beef across grain.  Overlap slices on platter.  Spoon some sauce over; sprinkle with cheese and fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Ted Reader likes to marinate the roast in a coffee porter (a dark beer that's flavored with coffee or with dark malts and highly roasted barley) or a similar beer with body, such as Guinness or a honey brown lager.

What to drink:  Wyndham Estate 2003 Shiraz, Bin 555, South Eastern Australia ($10).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     purchased 10-oz fully-baked thin pizza
                        crust - (such as Boboli)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  baby spinach leaves - (packed) -- 1 1/2 to 2 oz
  1 1/2           cups  thickly-sliced mushrooms - (5 to 6 oz)
     1/2           cup  drained roasted red peppers from jar -- cut thin strips
     1/2           cup  paper-thin red onion slices
  8              large  fresh basil leaves -- cut thin strips
  1            package  soft fresh goat cheese - (5 oz) -- coarsely crumbled

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place pizza crust on large baking sheet.  Mix olive oil and minced garlic in small bowl.  Using pastry brush, brush 2 tablespoons garlic oil evenly over crust.  Top with spinach leaves, then sprinkle with sliced mushrooms, roasted red peppers, red onion slices, fresh basil, and crumbled goat cheese.  Drizzle pizza evenly with remaining garlic oil.

Bake pizza until crust is crisp and cheese begins to brown, about 18 minutes.  Transfer pizza to board.  Cut into wedges and serve warm.

Comments:  Marielle Ainsworth of Roswell, New Mexico, writes: "I'm a vegetarian, but my husband isn't, so I'm always looking for recipes that will make both of us happy.  I came up with the goat cheese pizza because it combines things we both love ó cheese and veggies.

If you're not a fan of goat cheese, whole-milk mozzarella, Fontina, or Gorgonzola can also be used.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASTING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  apple butter
     1/4           cup  bourbon whiskey
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  apple cider
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
                        === RIBS ===
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2                     racks baby back pork ribs - (2 to 2 1/4 lb
  1              large  onion -- sliced
  1                     cinnamon stick -- broken in half
  6                     thin rounds peeled fresh ginger
  1 1/4           cups  apple cider

For Basting Sauce:  Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

For Ribs:  Mix first 7 ingredients in small bowl.  Using small sharp knife, loosen membrane from underside of each rib rack and pull off (or score membrane).  Rub 1 tablespoon seasoning mix into each side of each rib rack.  Place ribs in large roasting pan.  Cover and chill at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lift ribs from pan.  Scatter onion, cinnamon stick, and ginger in pan.  Pour in cider.  Return ribs, meat-side down, to pan; cover pan with foil.  Roast ribs until meat is tender and begins to pull away from bones, about 2 hours.  Uncover; cool at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill ribs until heated through and slightly charred, about 5 minutes per side.  Brush generously on all sides with basting sauce.  Grill until sauce becomes sticky glaze, about 3 minutes longer per side.  Transfer rib racks to cutting board.  Cut racks between bones into individual ribs.  Arrange on platter and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Be sure to remove (or score) the membrane on the underside of the ribs so that the seasonings can penetrate and fully flavor the meat.  Even better, ask the butcher to remove the membrane.

What to drink:  Kenwood Vineyards 2003 Pinot Noir, Russian River Valley ($17).

Recipe By     :Chef Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  coarsely-grated Monterey Jack cheese - -- (packed)
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Butter 8- by 8- by 2-inch metal baking pan.

Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Stir in cheese.  Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and honey in another medium bowl to blend.  Add butter; whisk until blended.  Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients; stir just until combined (do not overmix).

Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Bake until tester inserted into center of bread comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely in pan on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields one 8-inch square cornbread.

Comments:  This cornbread is a little firmer and denser than one made for eating on its own so that it will hold up to grilling and tossing with the dressing for the Grilled Cornbread Salad with Red Onions, Arugula, and Red Wine Vnaigrette.

                        thigh pieces
  6                     chicken breast halves with skin and ribs
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1 1/2         pounds  cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced shallot
  4          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  3               cups  canola oil - (about)
  12              cups  baby spinach leaves

Mix buttermilk, curry powder, 3 teaspoons salt, and pepper in large bowl.  Add chicken; turn to coat.  Cover; chill at least 4 hours or overnight.

Remove chicken from refrigerator.  Line 2 baking sheets with paper towels.  Mix flour, chili powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in shallow dish.  Mix tomatoes and next 3 ingredients in another large bowl.

Add enough canola oil to 12-inch skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch.  Heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.  Remove 6 chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture.  Dip in flour mixture and turn to coat; shake off excess.  Add chicken, skin-side down, to skillet.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover; cook until brown, about 12 minutes.  Turn chicken over.  Cook uncovered until cooked through, about 5 minutes for breasts and 10 minutes for legs and thighs; transfer to paper towels.  Repeat with remaining chicken.  (Salad and chicken can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Add spinach to tomato salad; season with salt and pepper.  Divide salad among plates; top with chicken.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A good hit of curry spices up this classic.  Begin marinating the chicken in the buttermilk mixture the night before.

        Caesar Salad With Homemade Croutons And Balsamic Dressing

Recipe By     :Alexis Watson, Irvine, CA
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- divided
  3              large  garlic cloves -- crushed, divided
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  1                     loaf country-style white bread - (15 oz) -- crust removed,
                        cut into cubes
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2                     anchovy fillets
  1 1/2    tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2    tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1              large  romaine lettuce head -- torn bite size

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Whisk 1/4 cup oil, 2 garlic cloves, and coarse salt in large bowl to blend.  Add bread cubes and toss to coat.  Transfer croutons to baking sheet.  Bake croutons until golden brown, about 12 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

Combine cheese, mayonnaise, anchovies, vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, remaining 1/4 cup oil, and 1 garlic clove in blender; puree until smooth.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Place lettuce and croutons in large bowl.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Serve with any remaining dressing.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Alexis Watson of Irvine, California, writes: "You could say I'm a bit obsessive when it comes to cooking.  Often I'll take a particular recipe and spend months perfecting it, as I've done with the Caesar salad here.  My wife wanted an easy do-ahead dressing that was creamy but didn't use egg yolks.  Now we make this salad several times a week, so it was certainly well worth the effort."

        Cedar-Planked Monkfish With Fire-Roasted Puttanesca Relish

Recipe By     :Ted Reader
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     untreated (abt 12" by 10" by 1") red
                        cedar plank
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2                     plum tomatoes -- halved lengthwise
  1              small  sweet onion -- quartered
                        = (such as Vidalia or Maui)
  1              large  red bell pepper -- halved lengthwise
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped
  3                     anchovy fillets -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
  1         tablespoon  white balsamic vinegar
                        = (or unseasoned rice vinegar)
  4                     monkfish fillets - (6 oz ea)
  8                     long thin prosciutto slices

Fill roasting pan with water.  Add cedar plank; weigh down with can or small pot to keep submerged and soak 1 day.

Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Brush grill rack with 1 tablespoon oil.  Arrange tomatoes, onion, and bell pepper on rimmed baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Grill vegetables until lightly charred and blistered, turning occasionally with tongs, about 4 minutes for tomatoes and 8 minutes for onion and pepper.  Return vegetables to same sheet and cool slightly.

Peel tomato halves; peel pepper halves.  Chop all vegetables coarsely and place in medium bowl.  Add olives, anchovies, garlic, basil, capers, vinegar, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Toss to blend.  Season relish to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 hour ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Sprinkle fillets with salt and pepper.  Wrap 2 prosciutto slices around each fillet, leaving top and bottom exposed.  Secure prosciutto with toothpicks.  Press each fillet slightly to flatten top.

Drain cedar plank.  Place fillets on plank.  Spoon 1/4 cup relish atop each fillet and press to adhere.  Place plank on grill; cover barbecue.  Cook fish until just opaque in center and thermometer inserted into center registers 120 degrees, checking occasionally and spraying plank with water if beginning to burn, about 18 minutes.  Transfer fish to plates.  Serve, passing remaining relish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Planking is one of Ted Reader's favorite ways to cook because it simultaneously bakes, grills, and smokes the meat or fish.  It's an especially good technique for barbecuing fish, which has a tendency to flake and fall apart on the grill.  For this recipe, begin soaking the cedar plank one day ahead.

What To Drink:  J.L. Wolf 2003 Riesling, Wachenheimer Belz, Pfalz, Germany ($20).

Shopping tip:  Use a 1-inch-thick cedar plank for the monkfish.  Thinner planks have a tendency to burn and warp on the grill.  Look for cedar marked "untreated" at lumberyards and some home-improvement stores.  Or order planks from Satuee Cedar Company (sauteecedar.com; 866-728-8332).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                cup  chopped sweet onion
                        = (such as Vidalia or Maui)
  3               cups  fresh corn kernels
                        = (cut from about 3 ears of corn)
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice -- divided
  1                cup  water - (or more)
  1           teaspoon  adobo sauce from canned chipotle chiles
                        Fresh cilantro leaves

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add corn kernels, broth, and 1 tablespoon lime juice; bring mixture to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until corn is just tender, about 3 minutes.  Working in batches, puree soup in blender until almost smooth.  Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice and 1 cup water (or more as needed to thin soup to desired consistency).  Season corn soup to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer soup to large bowl; cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours or overnight.

Meanwhile, whisk remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and adobo sauce in small bowl to blend.  Divide chilled corn soup among 4 bowls.  Drizzle soup with adobo oil, then garnish with cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Adobo is the spicy tomato sauce that comes in the can with chipotle chiles.  Look for canned chipotles at supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Latin markets.

                        Chopped Honey-Mustard Slaw

Recipe By     :Chef Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     green cabbage head - (abt 2 lbs) -- quartered, cored,
                        thinly sliced lengthwise, then chopped
                        crosswise (abt 16 cups)
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2 1/2    tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  celery seeds
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce

Place cabbage in large colander; set colander over large bowl.  Sprinkle salt over cabbage and toss.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Whisk all remaining ingredients in small bowl to blend.  (Dressing can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Discard all liquid accumulated in bowl from cabbage.  Rinse cabbage under cold water to remove some of salt.  Working in batches, squeeze out as much liquid as possible from cabbage.  Transfer cabbage to large serving bowl.  Pour 3/4 cup dressing over and toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)  Season with pepper.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Prep Tip:  When Tom Douglas makes the chopped slaw, he likes to salt the cabbage and let it sit in a colander to drain overnight before using it.  Draining prevents the cabbage juices from diluting the dressing, so the slaw stays creamy, even when chilled overnight.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4         sticks  unsalted butter - (1/2 cup plus 2 tbspns) -- 1 stick cold and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes and 2 tbspns melted
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  well-shaken chilled buttermilk
  3        tablespoons  turbinado sugar
                        = (such as Sugar in the Raw)
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Parchment paper
                        A 2 1/2" round biscuit cutter
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Softened butter
                        Jam

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Whisk together flour, baking powder, granulated sugar, and salt in a bowl.  Blend in butter cubes with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir together egg and buttermilk in another bowl, then add to flour mixture, stirring with a fork until a dough forms.

Gather dough into a ball, then turn out onto a floured surface and gently knead 7 or 8 times.  Roll out dough with a floured rolling pin into a 1/2-inch-thick round and cut out as many biscuits as possible with biscuit cutter.  Gather scraps and knead once, then pat out into a 1/2-inch-thick round and cut out more biscuits.

Arrange biscuits 1 inch apart on baking sheet and brush tops and sides with melted butter.  Stir together turbinado sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over biscuits (sugar will form a crust).

Bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 15 minutes.  Transfer biscuits to a rack and cool to warm, about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields about 12 biscuits.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     eggplant - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1             medium  onion -- cubed
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings in
                        juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  drained capers
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil
                        Toasted pine nuts

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add eggplant, onion, and garlic cloves.  sautÈ until eggplant is soft and brown, about 15 minutes.  Add diced tomatoes with juice, then red wine vinegar and drained capers.  Cover and simmer until eggplant and onion are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.

Season caponata to taste with salt and pepper.  Mix in fresh basil.  Transfer caponata to serving bowl.  Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts.  Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.  (Caponata can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Doris Jacobson of Anaheim, California, writes: "I host many family gatherings, and I always get requests for my lemon bars and my caponata appetizer.  They're easy to make and perfect for picnics at the beach or an evening at the Hollywood Bowl.  Plus, both recipes can be made ahead.

Fresh basil brightens up this traditional eggplant spread.  Serve it on baguette slices or crackers.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh chives
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lime peel
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        Sugar -- (optional)
  8               ears  corn

Mix first 7 ingredients in medium bowl.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

To boil corn:  Bring large pot of water to boil; add pinch of sugar, if desired.  Husk corn.  Add corn to pot.  Return water to boil and cook corn 4 minutes.  Drain corn and serve immediately with lime-chive butter.

To grill corn:  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Remove all but the innermost husks from corn.  Fold back inner husks and remove corn silk.  Rewrap inner husks around corn.  Grill until husks are slightly charred and corn is tender, turning often, about 10 minutes.  Serve immediately with lime-chive butter.

Easy Serving:   Place the seasoned butter in large sealable container.  Add hot drained corn.  Seal container and shake until butter melts and coats corn.  Transfer buttered corn to bowl.

Comments:  Lime juice, sea salt, and chives come together in a bright-tasting butter for sweet summer corn.

What to drink:  An oaky California Chardonnay.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2             pounds  small white-skinned potatoes
                        = (such as White Rose)
  1                cup  cooked corn kernels
                        = (from 1 medium ear)
     1/2           cup  chopped sweet onion
                        = (such as Vidalia or Maui)
  1                can  hearts of palm - (14 oz) -- drained, each
                        cut crosswise into 1/3"-thk rounds
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        diced - (abt 1 1/4 cups)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1                     avocado -- pitted, peeled,
                        and chopped

Whisk buttermilk, mayonnaise, lime juice, cumin, and cayenne in medium bowl to blend.

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain; cool.

Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes.  Place potatoes in large bowl; add corn, onion, hearts of palm, tomatoes, and cilantro.  Drizzle dressing over potato mixture; toss to coat.  Season generously with salt.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)  Gently stir in avocado and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A bold medley of cumin, cayenne, corn, and cilantro ups the flavor here.  Great with grilled-fish tacos, steak fajitas, or chipotle-rubbed chicken.

Test-Kitchen Tip: Pitting an avocado - Cut an unpeeled avocado in half lengthwise.  Grasp both sides and twist to open.  Tap a large knife into the pit so it sticks, then twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit.

Comments:  A bold medley of cumin, cayenne, corn, and cilantro ups the flavor here.  Great with grilled-fish tacos, steak fajitas, or chipotle-rubbed chicken.

Test-Kitchen Tip: Pitting an avocado - Cut an unpeeled avocado in half lengthwise.  Grasp both sides and twist to open.  Tap a large knife into the pit so it sticks, then twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  quinoa - (abt 6 oz)
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  7        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice with pulp
     1/4           cup  finely-grated lemon peel
                        = (from about 6 large lemons)
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
                        Additional powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in 2/3 cup powdered sugar.  Add 2 cups all purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, beating until moist clumps form.  Using back of fork, press dough over bottom of nonstick 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan.  Bake crust until light golden, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, beat 2 cups sugar and eggs in medium bowl until blended.  Beat in fresh lemon juice with pulp, lemon peel, and baking powder, then remaining 1/4 cup all purpose flour for filling.

Pour lemon filling over hot crust.  Bake until filling is set in center and begins to brown on top, about 20 minutes.  Transfer pan to rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Cut pastry into 24 bars.  Transfer lemon bars to serving platter and dust with additional powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 24 bars.

Comments:  Doris Jacobson of Anaheim, California, writes: "I host many family gatherings, and I always get requests for my lemon bars.  They're easy to make and perfect for picnics at the beach or an evening at the Hollywood Bowl.  Plus, they can be made ahead."

Lots of lemon zest and lemon juice with all the pulp set these bars apart.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To remove all juice and pulp for the lemon filling, cut lemons in half and use a tiny spoon to scoop between the membranes; discard seeds.

                  Fennel- And Dill-Rubbed Grilled Salmon

Recipe By     :Chef Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar -- plus
  2          teaspoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  PimentÛn de la Vera
                        = (Spanish smoked paprika)
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  dried dill weed
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1                     side of salmon with skin - -- (3 3/4 to 4 lbs)
                        = (preferably wild salmon)
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Finely grind fennel seeds in spice mill or coffee grinder.  Transfer to small bowl.  Mix in next 5 ingredients.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray.  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush salmon lightly on both sides with olive oil.  Rub spice mixture generously over flesh side of salmon.  Place salmon, skin-side up, on grill rack; cover and cook until fish is slightly firmer, about 8 minutes.

Slide rimless baking sheet under salmon to turn salmon over without breaking.  Place another rimless baking sheet atop salmon.  Using both hands, firmly hold baking sheets together and invert salmon; slide salmon, flesh-side up, off baking sheet and onto grill rack.  Cover and grill until just opaque in center, about 8 minutes longer.

Using rimless baking sheet, remove salmon from grill.  Gently slide salmon, flesh-side up, onto platter and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Be sure to buy the salmon with the skin on, which makes it much easier to handle as it grills.  Keep in mind this is a special cut that your fish market or supermarket seafood counter may have to order.

What to drink:  Tom Douglas likes to pair this with a Washington State Chardonnay.  Try: Columbia Crest 2002 Grand Estates Chardonnay ($11).

Market tip:  Look for PimentÛn de la Vera at specialty foods stores, or order it from La Tienda (888-472-1022; tienda.com) or The Spanish Table (206-682-2827; spanishtable.com).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt -- divided
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced, divided
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped red onion
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2 1/4           cups  water
     1/2         pound  sugar snap peas
  2               cups  couscous
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  2 1/2         pounds  ahi tuna steaks, abt 1 1/4" thick

Combine first 3 ingredients in heavy small skillet.  Toast over medium heat until fragrant, shaking skillet occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Grind spice mixture in spice grinder.  Transfer to bowl; mix in 1 teaspoon salt.

Whisk mayonnaise, lemon juice, chives, and half of garlic in small bowl.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store spice mixture airtight at room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate lemon aioli.)

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add carrot and onion and sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Add thyme and remaining garlic and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add 2 1/4 cups water and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; bring to boil.  Add sugar snap peas and cook until crisp-tender, about 1 minute.  Using slotted spoon, transfer peas to plate.  Immediately add couscous to water in skillet and stir to combine.  Cover and remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Fluff couscous with fork.  Transfer to bowl and cool completely.  Mix in sugar snap peas and dill.  Season to taste with pepper.  (Couscous can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Coat tuna with 6 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle with spice mixture.  Grill tuna until seared outside and rare in center, about 4 minutes per side.  Refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour, then cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Spoon couscous onto plates.  Top with tuna and drizzle with lemon aioli.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Chef Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     2/3           cup  olive oil
                        === SALAD ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
                        Buttermilk Cornbread With
                        Monterey Jack Cheese -- (see recipe)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  2              small  red onions -- cut 3/4"-thk rounds
  1                     container cherry tomatoes - (12 oz) -- halved
  1            package  baby arugula - (5 oz)
  2               cups  torn fresh basil leaves - (packed)
     1/2                English hothouse cucumber -- halved lengthwise,
                        then thinly sliced crosswise
     1/2           cup  oil-cured black olives -- pitted

For Vinaigrette:  Whisk vinegar, shallots, and mustard in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in oil.  Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring vinaigrette to room temperature and rewhisk before using.)

For Salad:  Spray grill rack with nonstick spray.  Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Cut cornbread into 4 squares; remove from pan.  Cut each square into four 1-inch-wide strips.  Brush cornbread strips lightly on all sides with oil.  Grill bread just until grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer bread to work surface; cool.  Brush onion rounds with oil.  Grill until tender and golden, turning once, about 6 minutes per side.  Transfer to large bowl; cool.

Cut bread into 1-inch cubes.  Separate onion rounds into rings; return onions to same bowl.  (Grilled cornbread and onions can be prepared 4 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.)

Add tomatoes, arugula, basil, cucumber, and olives to bowl with onion rings.  Add vinaigrette and toss to coat, then add cornbread and toss gently; serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  To make this fresh American rendition of panzanella (the Italian bread-and-tomato salad), bake the cornbread one day ahead so that it will be firm enough to toast on the grill.

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder -- divided
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     Cornish game hens - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea) -- each cut lengthwise
                        in half
  2               cups  basmati rice
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/3           cup  dried currants
  4               cups  fresh arugula - (loosely packed)
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1                cup  hickory-smoked almonds

Mix 3 tablespoons oil, 2 teaspoons chili powder, and next 5 ingredients in small bowl until paste forms.  Spread paste all over hens.  Let marinate 30 minutes at room temperature.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Grill hens until cooked through, turning occasionally, about 35 minutes.  Transfer to platter and cool.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate.)

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add rice and stir 3 minutes.  Add broth and currants; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.

Place arugula in large bowl.  Top with hot rice; toss to wilt arugula.  Cool.

Whisk remaining 4 tablespoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and vinegar in small bowl; pour over rice, add almonds, and toss.  (Can be made 3 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)  Serve game hens with rice.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  If you buy fresh game hens, ask the butcher to cut them in half for you.  To halve frozen thawed game hens, first cut out the back bones using poultry shears, then cut hens in half.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2    tablespoons  mirin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Chinese five-spice powder
                        = (or 4 whole star anise, ground)
  3        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  3        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
  3        tablespoons  unseasoned rice vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  toasted sesame oil (such as Asian)
  2                     beef rib-eye steaks - (10 to 12 oz ea)
  4              large  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed
  2                     baby bok choy -- quartered lengthwise

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Mix mirin, Chinese five-spice powder, hoisin sauce, toasted sesame seeds, vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil in small saucepan; bring to boil.  Cool.  Place steaks, mushrooms, and bok choy on baking sheet.  Pour half of sauce over; turn to coat.  Reserve remaining sauce in same saucepan.  Sprinkle steaks evenly with salt and pepper.

Grill steaks, mushrooms, and bok choy until meat is medium-rare and vegetables are partially charred, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes for steaks, 8 minutes for mushrooms, and 5 minutes for bok choy.  Slice steaks; divide between 2 plates with mushrooms and bok choy.  Bring remaining sauce to simmer; drizzle sauce over steak slices, mushrooms, and bok choy and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Meat and veg all in one recipe ó and all from the grill.

Market Tip:  If you can't find some of the ingredients for the steaks at the grocery store, look for them at Asian markets.  Star anise is a brown star-shaped seed pod native to China; it is often an ingredient in Chinese five-spice powder.

              Grilled Moroccan Chicken With Curried Couscous

Recipe By     :Courtesy of Brix, Denver, CO
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HARISSA ===
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds
  1         tablespoon  dried crushed red pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves
  3        tablespoons  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        === CHICKEN AND DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  5        tablespoons  fresh lime juice -- divided
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lime peel
  1                     chicken - (2 3/4 to 3 lbs) -- quartered, and
                        backbone removed
  1              pinch  sugar
                        === CURRIED COUSCOUS ===
  1 3/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
  1            package  plain couscous - (10 oz)

For Harissa:  Toast caraway, coriander, and cumin seeds in medium skillet over medium heat until slightly darker in color, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Cool completely.  Grind cooled spices and dried crushed red pepper in mortar with pestle or spice grinder to fine powder.  Add oil and garlic; grind to smooth paste.  Stir in paprika and salt.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Chicken And Dressing:  Whisk 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon harissa, 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons lime juice, and lime peel in small bowl.  Rub mixture over all sides of chicken pieces.  Place chicken in 11- by 7- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Cover and marinate overnight.

Whisk remaining 1/2 cup oil, 3 tablespoons lime juice, and pinch of sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.  (Dressing can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat barbecue (medium-low heat).  Grill chicken until cooked through, turning and repositioning occasionally for even cooking, about 45 minutes total.  Let stand at room temperature.

For Couscous:  Bring chicken broth and curry powder to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Stir in couscous, cover, and remove from heat; let stand 5 minutes.  Fluff couscous with fork and transfer to platter.  Place chicken atop couscous.  Serve, passing dressing and remaining harissa alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Julie Fendrich of Denver, Colorado, writes: "My husband and I love going to Brix in Denver's Cherry Creek neighborhood.  We are absolutely crazy about the Moroccan chicken.  Any chance the restaurant might share the recipe?"

Harissa, a spicy sauce from North Africa, adds heat to the marinade and tastes great drizzled over both the chicken and the couscous.  The chicken needs to marinate overnight, so plan accordingly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD ===
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted bell peppers - (abt 3 large) -- cut 1 1/2"-wide
                        strips
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted summer squash -- cut lengthwise into

  1             medium  red onion -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
  1                     loaf of ciabatta - (12 to 14 oz) -- some crust trimmed
                        to expose bread, cut crosswise into
                        1"-thk slices
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        cut into thirds
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1              pound  tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut into 3/4" dice, juices reserved
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped assorted fresh herbs
                        = (such as chives, dill, chervil, and
                        tarragon)
  2        tablespoons  drained capers

For Salad:  Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Brush both sides of bell peppers, squash, onion, and bread slices lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill vegetables until tender and brown, about 4 minutes per side for peppers and squash and 3 minutes per side for onion.  Grill bread until browned and crisp, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Rub bread with cut sides of garlic.  Tear bread into 3/4-inch pieces; place in very large bowl.  Cut grilled vegetables into 1-inch pieces; add to bread in bowl.

For Dressing:  Whisk first 3 ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in 1/3 cup oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Assembly:  Add dressing, tomatoes with juices, and all remaining ingredients to salad; toss.  Let stand 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Grilled vegetables pump up the classic Tuscan bread-and-tomato salad.  Can't find ciabatta?  Use any good-quality crusty Italian or French bread.

What to drink:  An Italian white like Vernaccia di San Gimignano or Orvieto.

For Salad:  Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Brush both sides of bell peppers, squash, onion, and bread slices lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill vegetables until tender and brown, about 4 minutes per side for peppers and squash and 3 minutes per side for onion.  Grill bread until browned and crisp, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Rub bread with cut sides of garlic.  Tear bread into 3/4-inch pieces; place in very large bowl.  Cut grilled vegetables into 1-inch pieces; add to bread in bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Dressing:  Whisk first 3 ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in 1/3 cup oil.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assembly:  Add dressing, tomatoes with juices, and all remaining ingredients to salad; toss.  Let stand 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Grilled vegetables pump up the classic Tuscan bread-and-tomato salad.  Can&apos;t find ciabatta?  Use any good-quality crusty Italian or French bread.
</DirT>
<DirT>
What to drink:  An Italian white like Vernaccia di San Gimignano or Orvieto.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  1           envelope  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
                        Generous pinch of sugar
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour - (to 3 3/4) -- divided
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2      teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
                        === TOPPING ===
  3             medium  zucchini - (abt 1 lb total) -- trimmed, and
                        cut lengthwise into 1/4"-thk slices
  2              small  eggplants - (abt 1 1/2 lbs total) -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4"-thk slices
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (about) -- divided
     3/4           cup  purchased black-olive tapenade* - -- (abt 5 1/2 oz)
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh marjoram or fresh oregano
     3/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-grated Fontina cheese - (packed)
  1                cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley

* A thick paste or spread made from brine-cured olives, capers, anchovies, and seasonings; available at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Italian markets.

For Dough:  Stir 1 1/4 cups warm water, yeast, and sugar in large bowl to blend.  Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in 1 cup flour; let stand in warm draft-free area until bubbling, about 30 minutes.

Stir oil and salt, then 2 cups flour into yeast mixture.  Knead dough in bowl until almost smooth and beginning to pull away from sides, adding 1/4 cup more flour to prevent sticking.  Turn dough out onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls as needed (dough should be slightly sticky), about 7 minutes.  Place dough in lightly oiled large bowl; cover with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, for Topping:  Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Arrange zucchini and eggplant slices on 2 large baking sheets.  Brush vegetables with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until tender and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter.

If using charcoal barbecue, remove grate and arrange coals so that 1 side of grill is hot and 1 side is cooler (for gas barbecue, adjust burners accordingly).

Sprinkle 3 baking sheets with flour.  Punch down dough.  Divide dough into 3 equal pieces; roll out each piece on floured surface to 12- by 8-inch oval.  Transfer to prepared baking sheets.  Brush dough tops with oil.  Place ovals, oiled-side down, on hot side of grill rack and grill until bottoms are firm (watch closely to avoid burning), about 3 minutes.  Turn crusts over; grill until dough is set, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to baking sheets, grill-mark-side up.

Spread 1/4 cup tapenade over each pizza; arrange grilled zucchini and eggplant slices over.  Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon marjoram and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper.  Drizzle lightly with oil.  Sprinkle each with 1/2 cup Fontina and 1/3 cup Pecorino Romano.  Return pizzas to cooler side of grill.  Cover and grill until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle pizzas with parsley; slice and serve.

This recipe yields 3 medium pizzas.

Comments:  Ultra-creamy Fontina cheese and a layer of black-olive tapenade give this an unctuous, satisfying quality that is usually missing from other veggie pizzas.

What to drink:  Dry rosÈ or a spicy RhÙne-style red.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HAM HOCKS ===
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                cup  chopped carrots
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  dry vermouth
  6              whole  black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  mustard seeds
  1                     bay leaf
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1 1/3         pounds  meaty smoked ham hocks
                        === GRITS ===
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2               cups  quick-cooking grits
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
                        SautÈed Apples -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  grated extra-sharp white cheddar cheese -- divided
                        Chopped fresh thyme -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Melt butter in large ovenproof pot over high heat.  Add onions and next 3 ingredients; sautÈ until vegetables are soft and golden, about 7 minutes.  Add vermouth and next 3 ingredients; stir 1 minute.  Add chicken broth and ham hocks.  Bring to boil; cover and bake until ham hocks are very tender, about 1 hour.  Cool.

Remove ham hocks.  Boil ham hock broth until reduced to 1 cup, about 25 minutes.  Pull ham from bones and reserve (discard bones and skin).  Strain broth.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover ham and broth separately; chill.)

For grits:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bring chicken broth to boil in large saucepan.  Gradually whisk in grits.  Add 2 teaspoons minced thyme.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until grits are thick and smooth, whisking frequently, about 7 minutes.

Stir reserved ham, SautÈed Apples, and 1 cup cheddar cheese into grits.  Transfer mixture to 13- by 9- by 2-inch oval baking dish.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.  Bake until cheese is golden, about 30 minutes.  Rewarm ham hock broth.  Garnish grits with chopped thyme and serve, drizzling broth over.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Karen Schineller of Ridgewood, New Jersey, writes: "Every year, I visit my cousins in Dallas, and every year, we try a different restaurant.  This time, we went to George.  The short ribs came with the most unusual grits.  I'd like to make them, but don't know where to start."

This rich casserole would pair well with fried eggs at brunch.  For a more savory version, simply omit the sautÈed apples.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  honey
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)

                        === SPICY RANCH SAUCE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

  4                     green onions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chile
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === BURGERS ===
  2             pounds  ground beef
  1 1/4           cups  chopped onion - (abt 1 small)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

  1           teaspoon  salt

     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === WORCESTERSHIRE-COFFEE GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee crystals
  2          teaspoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  butter
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  16                    bacon slices
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  8                     hamburger buns -- split horizontally
                        = (or 3" to 4" square focaccia rolls)
  8                     lettuce leaves
  2               cups  coarsely-shredded sharp white cheddar
                        cheese
                        Assorted additional toppings
                        = (such as tomato and grilled onion
                        slices)

For Spicy Ranch Sauce:  Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

For burgers:  Gently mix all ingredients in large bowl.  Form mixture into eight 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick patties.  Place on small baking sheet.  Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

For Glaze:  Stir first 5 ingredients in small saucepan over medium heat until coffee is dissolved.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in butter.  Season glaze to taste with salt and pepper.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Working in batches if necessary, cook bacon in large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and brown.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray.  Toast buns until golden, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer buns, cut-side up, to plates.  Place lettuce on each bun bottom.  Grill burgers 5 minutes, basting with glaze.  Turn burgers, baste with glaze, and grill until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes longer for medium.  Press cheese atop each burger and allow cheese to melt.  Place some sauce, then 1 burger on each bun bottom.  Top each with 2 slices bacon and desired additional toppings.  Cover with bun top.  Serve with remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The little green chile makes an appearance in the burger and in its creamy ranch sauce.

What to drink: Chateau Souverain 2002 Zinfandel, Dry Creek Valley ($22).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON CURD AND MOUSSE ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2 1/4      teaspoons  cornstarch
     3/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  9              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  chilled heavy whipping cream
                        === BLUEBERRY COMPOTE ===
  1 1/2           cups  fresh blueberries -- divided
                        = (from two 1/2-pint containers)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
                        === CRUST ===
  1                     Tender Pie Crust dough disk -- (see recipe)
                        === MERINGUE ===
  3              large  egg whites
     1/2           cup  sugar

For Lemon Curd And Mousse:  Whisk sugar and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Gradually add lemon juice, whisking until cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in yolks.  Add butter.  Cook over medium heat until curd thickens and boils, whisking constantly, about 8 minutes.  Transfer curd to medium bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd.  Refrigerate at least 1 day.  (Can be prepared 5 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold 3/4 cup lemon curd into whipped cream 1/4 cup at a time.  Chill lemon mousse at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.  Keep remaining curd chilled.

For Blueberry Compote:  Combine 3/4 cup blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, grated lemon peel, salt, and cinnamon in small saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in flour; cook 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Stir in remaining 3/4 cup blueberries.  Transfer compote to small bowl.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep compote refrigerated.)

For Crust:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Roll out pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13 1/2-inch round.  Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold edges under and crimp decoratively; chill 30 minutes.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans from crust.  Bake crust until golden and cooked through, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes longer.  Transfer crust to rack and cool completely.

Spread 1 1/2 cups of remaining lemon curd over bottom of crust.  Using slotted spoon and leaving most of juices behind, spoon 3/4 cup blueberry compote evenly over curd.  Drop lemon mousse in dollops over blueberries; spread to cover berries completely.  Using slotted spoon, spoon remaining blueberries over mousse.  Chill pie while preparing meringue.

For Meringue:  Whisk egg whites and sugar in large metal bowl to blend.  Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water); whisk constantly until sugar dissolves and mixture is very warm to touch, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat mixture until thick and fluffy peaks form, about 5 minutes.  Spoon meringue into pastry bag fitted with large (about 3/4-inch) plain tip.  Pipe meringue decoratively over top of pie, leaving 1-inch plain border to expose some of mousse and blueberries.  Using pastry torch, singe meringue until golden.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Begin making this at least one day ahead.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To make the dramatic meringue peaks, be sure to use a large pastry tip to pipe the rosettes, then sweep them upward using an offset spatula or butter knife.  Even easier: Just spoon dollops of fluffy meringue atop the pie.

For Lemon Curd And Mousse:  Whisk sugar and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Gradually add lemon juice, whisking until cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in yolks.  Add butter.  Cook over medium heat until curd thickens and boils, whisking constantly, about 8 minutes.  Transfer curd to medium bowl.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd.  Refrigerate at least 1 day.  (Can be prepared 5 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold 3/4 cup lemon curd into whipped cream 1/4 cup at a time.  Chill lemon mousse at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.  Keep remaining curd chilled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Blueberry Compote:  Combine 3/4 cup blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, grated lemon peel, salt, and cinnamon in small saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in flour; cook 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Stir in remaining 3/4 cup blueberries.  Transfer compote to small bowl.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep compote refrigerated.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Crust:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Roll out pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13 1/2-inch round.  Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold edges under and crimp decoratively; chill 30 minutes.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans from crust.  Bake crust until golden and cooked through, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 20 minutes longer.  Transfer crust to rack and cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread 1 1/2 cups of remaining lemon curd over bottom of crust.  Using slotted spoon and leaving most of juices behind, spoon 3/4 cup blueberry compote evenly over curd.  Drop lemon mousse in dollops over blueberries; spread to cover berries completely.  Using slotted spoon, spoon remaining blueberries over mousse.  Chill pie while preparing meringue.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Meringue:  Whisk egg whites and sugar in large metal bowl to blend.  Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water); whisk constantly until sugar dissolves and mixture is very warm to touch, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat mixture until thick and fluffy peaks form, about 5 minutes.  Spoon meringue into pastry bag fitted with large (about 3/4-inch) plain tip.  Pipe meringue decoratively over top of pie, leaving 1-inch plain border to expose some of mousse and blueberries.  Using pastry torch, singe meringue until golden.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Begin making this at least one day ahead.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Test-Kitchen Tip:  To make the dramatic meringue peaks, be sure to use a large pastry tip to pipe the rosettes, then sweep them upward using an offset spatula or butter knife.  Even easier: Just spoon dollops of fluffy meringue atop the pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  whole milk
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- diced
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                cup  whole-milk ricotta cheese
     1/3           cup  mascarpone cheese
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel

Bring milk, butter, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter melts.  Add flour; stir until batter is smooth and forms ball, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat and whisk in eggs, 1 at a time.

Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 2 inches.  Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pan and heat oil to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, drop 1 tablespoon batter into oil for each cream puff.  Fry until golden brown and puffed, about 5 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer cream puffs to paper towels to drain.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Blend ricotta cheese, mascarpone cheese, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, and lemon peel in medium bowl for filling.  Cut cream puffs in half horizontally.  Spoon 1 rounded teaspoon filling into bottoms; cover with tops.  Arrange on platter.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 3 dozen.

Comments:  Chef Sal Passalacqua of Dimaio Cucina in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, writes: "My father's family is from Sicily and I spent my teenage years there, so that's where a lot of my culinary influences come from.  At first glance, Sicilian cooking seems very simple, but that simplicity depends on using the freshest ingredients and often the combination of sweet and tart flavors.  The anchovy pasta and the ricotta and mascarpone cream puffs here are perfect examples."

These can be served for dessert, tea, or brunch.  Mascarpone, an Italian cream cheese, is sold at many supermarkets and at Italian markets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  hot water
  5        tablespoons  fish sauce
  3 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2                     Thai bird chiles with seeds -- minced
                        = (or 1/2 jalapeÒo chile with seeds)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        === PORK ===
  6                     green onions -- chopped (1/2  cup)
                        = (white and pale green parts only)
  3        tablespoons  chopped lemongrass
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless pork loin chops - (to 1 3/4)
                        = (each 1/3" to 1/2" thick)
                        === SALAD AND NOODLES ===
  1              small  English hothouse cucumber -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced crosswise
  1                     baby pineapple -- peeled, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
                        = (or 1/2 small pineapple, peeled, cut
                        into 2 wedges, cored, thinly sliced)
  2               cups  bean sprouts
  1                cup  fresh Thai basil leaves
  1                cup  fresh cilantro leaves
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves
  20                    fresh green shiso leaves
     1/2           cup  finely shredded carrot
  1            package  dried rice vermicelli noodles - -- (8 to 9 oz)
  3              heads  butter lettuce -- cored, leaves
                        separated

For Dipping Sauce:  Mix all ingredients in small bowl.  Season sauce to taste with salt.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Pork:  Mix first 6 ingredients and 2 tablespoons oil in 11- by 7-inch glass dish.  Add pork chops to marinade, turn several times to coat evenly, then crowd together in single layer.  Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

For Salad And Noodles:  Arrange cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts, all herbs, and carrot around edge of large platter.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender and turning white, separating often with tongs, about 4 minutes.  Drain.  Arrange in center of platter.  Mound lettuce leaves in large shallow bowl.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush grill rack with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Grill pork with marinade still clinging to meat until slightly charred and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side, depending on thickness.  Transfer pork to cutting board.  Let rest 10 minutes.

Cut pork crosswise into 1/3-inch-wide strips.  Place pork and any juices from board atop noodles.  To serve, fill lettuce leaves with pork, noodles, herbs, and vegetables.  Serve with sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Great for a summer party, this recipe doubles easily, and most of the elements can be done ahead.  "This dish exemplifies the lively and engaging nature of the Vietnamese table," says Mai Pham, "the ritual of wrapping meats in crisp lettuce with fresh herbs, then dipping them into a zesty sauce."  Provide each person with a little bowl of sauce, as well as the usual plate to make assembly easier.

Comments:  Great for a summer party, this recipe doubles easily, and most of the elements can be done ahead.  &quot;This dish exemplifies the lively and engaging nature of the Vietnamese table,&quot; says Mai Pham, &quot;the ritual of wrapping meats in crisp lettuce with fresh herbs, then dipping them into a zesty sauce.&quot;  Provide each person with a little bowl of sauce, as well as the usual plate to make assembly easier.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  2              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and chopped
                        === FILLING ===
  5             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  3             ounces  high-quality milk chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Perugina)
  1 1/2           cups  chilled heavy whipping cream -- divided
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  heavy whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        === GARNISH ===
  1              Large  chocolate shards or curls
                        = (from 1" to 2"-thick 8-oz piece
                        bittersweet or semisweet chocolate)
                        Additional toasted husked hazelnuts
                        Candied orange peel strips

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 13- by 9- by 1-inch baking sheet with parchment paper; butter parchment.  Combine first 4 ingredients in medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water; stir until chocolate and butter melt.  Remove bowl from over water; stir in salt (mixture will be grainy).

Beat eggs and 2 tablespoons sugar in another medium bowl until pale, about 6 minutes; fold into chocolate mixture.  Fold in flour, then hazelnuts.  Spread batter evenly on baking sheet.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 13 minutes (cake will be thin).  Transfer pan to rack.  Cool cake completely.

For Filling:  Combine chocolates in medium metal bowl.  Bring 1 cup cream to simmer in small saucepan; pour cream over chocolates and let stand 1 minute.  Stir until melted and smooth.  Chill mixture until firm, about 2 hours.

Place bowl with chilled chocolate mixture over saucepan of barely simmering water until mixture is partially melted (do not stir), about 5 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water; add butter to bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat until filling is thick and glossy, about 3 minutes.  Using clean dry beaters, beat 1/2 cup chilled whipping cream in another medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into filling.

Cover 14- by 5-inch cardboard rectangle with foil.  Invert cake onto work surface; remove parchment.  Cut cake lengthwise in half.  Place 1 cake half on foil-covered cardboard.  Spread 1/2 cup chocolate filling over.  Top with second cake half.  Spoon remaining filling into pastry bag fitted with large plain round tip.  Pipe filling atop cake in side-by-side lengthwise rows, then smooth top.  Chill until filling is firm, about 1 hour.

For Glaze:  Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; let stand 5 minutes.  Stir until smooth.  Add butter; stir until melted.  Let stand until barely lukewarm but still pourable, about 20 minutes.

Place cardboard base with cake on rack set over rimmed baking sheet.  Spoon glaze over top of cake, allowing glaze to run down sides.  Using offset spatula, smooth glaze over sides.  Mound chocolate shards or curls over top and sides of cake.  Garnish with hazelnuts and candied orange peel.  Refrigerate until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  "All my favorite things are about chocolate," says Elizabeth Falkner.  Thin layers of flourless chocolate cake and an intensely chocolaty mousse are paired with crunchy hazelnuts and hints of orange in this truly decadent dessert.  Try it with a scoop of coffee-chocolate chip ice cream alongside.

For best results, use a premium bittersweet chocolate with a high cocoa bean content (variously labeled "cocoa solids," "cocoa," or "cacao"), such as Scharffen Berger 70 percent or Callebaut.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To get a neat slice each time, dip a large knife into a glass of hot water, then wipe it dry before cutting the next.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 13- by 9- by 1-inch baking sheet with parchment paper; butter parchment.  Combine first 4 ingredients in medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water; stir until chocolate and butter melt.  Remove bowl from over water; stir in salt (mixture will be grainy).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat eggs and 2 tablespoons sugar in another medium bowl until pale, about 6 minutes; fold into chocolate mixture.  Fold in flour, then hazelnuts.  Spread batter evenly on baking sheet.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 13 minutes (cake will be thin).  Transfer pan to rack.  Cool cake completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Combine chocolates in medium metal bowl.  Bring 1 cup cream to simmer in small saucepan; pour cream over chocolates and let stand 1 minute.  Stir until melted and smooth.  Chill mixture until firm, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place bowl with chilled chocolate mixture over saucepan of barely simmering water until mixture is partially melted (do not stir), about 5 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water; add butter to bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat until filling is thick and glossy, about 3 minutes.  Using clean dry beaters, beat 1/2 cup chilled whipping cream in another medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover 14- by 5-inch cardboard rectangle with foil.  Invert cake onto work surface; remove parchment.  Cut cake lengthwise in half.  Place 1 cake half on foil-covered cardboard.  Spread 1/2 cup chocolate filling over.  Top with second cake half.  Spoon remaining filling into pastry bag fitted with large plain round tip.  Pipe filling atop cake in side-by-side lengthwise rows, then smooth top.  Chill until filling is firm, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Glaze:  Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; let stand 5 minutes.  Stir until smooth.  Add butter; stir until melted.  Let stand until barely lukewarm but still pourable, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place cardboard base with cake on rack set over rimmed baking sheet.  Spoon glaze over top of cake, allowing glaze to run down sides.  Using offset spatula, smooth glaze over sides.  Mound chocolate shards or curls over top and sides of cake.  Garnish with hazelnuts and candied orange peel.  Refrigerate until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  &quot;All my favorite things are about chocolate,&quot; says Elizabeth Falkner.  Thin layers of flourless chocolate cake and an intensely chocolaty mousse are paired with crunchy hazelnuts and hints of orange in this truly decadent dessert.  Try it with a scoop of coffee-chocolate chip ice cream alongside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For best results, use a premium bittersweet chocolate with a high cocoa bean content (variously labeled &quot;cocoa solids,&quot; &quot;cocoa,&quot; or &quot;cacao&quot;), such as Scharffen Berger 70 percent or Callebaut.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Test-Kitchen Tip:  To get a neat slice each time, dip a large knife into a glass of hot water, then wipe it dry before cutting the next.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  6             medium  tomatoes or large romas -- cored, halved
                        crosswise, and seeded
  2              small  garlic cloves -- thinly slivered
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme -- divided
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry - (half of 17.3-o -- thawed
  1                cup  coarsely-grated whole-milk mozzarella
     1/2           cup  soft fresh goat cheese - (abt 4 oz)
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/3           cup  oil-cured black olives -- pitted
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil; brush foil with 1 tablespoon oil.  Place tomato halves, cut-side up, on baking sheet.  Sprinkle garlic and 1 tablespoon thyme over tomatoes; drizzle remaining 1/4 cup oil over.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Bake until tomatoes begin to shrink and are slightly dried but still soft, about 2 hours.  Cool tomatoes on sheet.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store in single layer in covered container in refrigerator.)

Roll out pastry on lightly floured surface to 13-inch square.  Transfer pastry to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom, pressing pastry firmly onto bottom and sides of pan.  Trim overhang to 3/4 inch.  Fold overhang in and press, pushing crust 1/4 inch above pan.  Pierce crust all over with fork; chill 30 minutes.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Line pastry with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until crust is set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans; bake until crust edges are golden, piercing with fork if crust bubbles, about 12 minutes longer.  Cool crust 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, using fork, mash mozzarella cheese, goat cheese, and remaining 1 tablespoon thyme together in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add eggs and cream and stir until mixture is well blended.  Spread cheese filling evenly in crust.  Arrange tomato halves in filling, cut-side up.  Place olives between tomatoes.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese evenly over top.  Bake until filling is puffed and set, about 35 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.  Push up pan bottom, releasing sides.  Serve tart warm.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Oven-drying the tomatoes before baking the tart concentrates their sweetness and prevents juices from softening the filling.

This makes a great summer starter, light lunch, or supper.

What to drink:  A glass of dry rosÈ to echo the ProvenÁal flavors of the tart, or a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Tender Pie Crust dough disks -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg white -- beaten to blend
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  sugar -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon - (scant)
  1              pinch  salt
  3 1/2         pounds  firm but ripe peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        pitted, each half cut into 3 wedges
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water -- (glaze)
  1         tablespoon  sugar mixed with
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon -- (cinnamon sugar)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Place foil-lined baking sheet in bottom of oven to catch any spills.  Roll out 1 pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 13 1/2-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold edges under and crimp decoratively, forming high rim (about 1/2 inch above sides of dish).  Chill crust 30 minutes.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans.  Bake crust until sides are set and pale golden, about 35 minutes.  Transfer to rack; remove foil and beans.  Brush warm crust with egg white.  Cool completely.

Meanwhile, line another baking sheet with parchment paper.  Roll out second pie crust disk on floured surface to 13 1/2-inch round.  Cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips.  Place strips on prepared baking sheet.  Chill while preparing filling.

For Filling:  Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl.  Add peaches and lemon juice and toss gently to coat.  Let stand 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir remaining 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 11 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add butter and cream (mixture will bubble vigorously); stir caramel until smooth.  Strain juices from peaches into caramel; cool to lukewarm.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Add caramel and flour to peaches in bowl; toss gently.  Transfer filling to crust, mounding in center.

Arrange 6 dough strips in 1 direction across top of pie, spacing apart.  Working with 1 strip at a time, arrange 6 more strips in opposite direction atop first, lifting strips and weaving over and under, forming lattice.  Gently press ends of strips to edge of baked bottom crust to adhere.  Trim overhang.  Brush lattice strips (but not crust edge) with egg yolk glaze.  Sprinkle strips with cinnamon sugar.

Bake pie 35 minutes.  Tent pie loosely with foil to prevent overbrowning.  Continue to bake pie until filling bubbles thickly and lattice is golden brown, about 25 minutes longer.  Cool pie on rack.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The fruit is tossed with a peach caramel sauce (juices from the peaches combined with homemade caramel) that adds depth of flavor to the filling.  Keep an eye on this pie as it bakes; it browns quickly and so needs to be tented with foil.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Here's an easy way to create the beautiful lattice-top look without any of the tricky weaving: Simply arrange 6 of the chilled pie crust strips diagonally across the top of the pie, then place the remaining 6 pastry strips diagonally in opposite direction atop first 6 strips.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Appetizers
                Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced anchovies
  2        tablespoons  minced cornichons
  2        tablespoons  harissa paste
                        Peel from 1 preserved lemon -- rinsed, minced
                        = (about 1/4 cup)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  vegetable oil
  1                cup  olive oil

Whisk first 8 ingredients in large bowl.  Gradually whisk in both oils.  Chill at least 2 hours or up to 2 weeks.  Rewhisk before serving.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Any kind of flatbread or crusty roll is perfect with this Moroccan concoction.  You could also use the dip as a salad dressing or sauce for fish.

Buying Guide:  Harissa paste, a spicy North African red chili paste, is sold at some supermarkets and Middle Eastern markets.  If unavailable, substitute hot Thai-style chili sauce, such as Sriracha.  Jars of preserved (brine-cured) lemons can be found at many specialty foods stores.  If unavailable, substitute a mixture of 1/4 cup grated lemon peel, 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon salt (let stand at room temperature for an hour before using).

  1            package  thinly sliced pancetta - (3 oz) -- chopped
                        = (Italian bacon)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Fontina cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage

Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead just until dough holds together, about 4 to 6 turns.  Flatten dough to 3/4-inch thickness.  Using 2 1/4-inch-diameter biscuit or cookie cutter, cut out rounds.  Re-roll dough and cut out more rounds until all dough is used.

Transfer biscuits to large rimmed ungreased baking sheet, spacing apart.  Brush biscuit tops with remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Bake until biscuits are puffed and golden, about 14 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields about 12 biscuits.

           Salad Of Fresh Herbs And Greens With Fried Eggplant

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  2        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
                        = (or fresh lemon juice)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground sumac* - (or more) -- optional
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (or more) -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  fresh Italian parsley leaves - -- (loosely packed)
  1 1/2           cups  arugula - (loosely packed) -- torn if large
  1                cup  small fresh basil leaves - -- (loosely packed)
  1                cup  torn fresh sorrel or
                        baby spinach leaves - (loosely packed)
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/3           cup  one-inch pieces fresh chives - -- (loosely packed)
     1/3           cup  fresh chervil leaves - (loosely packed) -- optional
  2                     eggplants - (10 to 12 oz ea) -- stems cut off
                        Coarse kosher salt -- as needed
                        Nasturtium blossoms or
                        other edible flowers -- (optional)

* A fruity and acidic seasoning powder made from ground dried sumac berries.  It is available at Middle Eastern markets and by mail from Adriana's Caravan (adrianascaravan.com).

Whisk shallot, vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon sumac, and cumin in small bowl.  Gradually whisk in 4 tablespoons oil.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.  Combine herbs and greens in large bowl.  (Dressing and salad can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover separately and chill.)

Using vegetable peeler, remove eggplant peel in vertical strips every 1 to 1 1/2 inches, making striped pattern.  Cut eggplants crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick rounds.  Place rounds in large colander.  Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and toss to coat evenly.  Let stand until rounds soften and release moisture, tossing occasionally, about 1 hour.  Rinse rounds, 1 at a time, and press to release excess moisture.  Arrange rounds in single layer on several thicknesses of paper towels.  Pat dry with additional towels.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, fry eggplant until golden and soft, adding more oil by tablespoonfuls as needed, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer eggplant to paper towels to drain.

Overlap eggplant rounds on platter.  Sprinkle with pepper and more sumac, if desired.  Toss herbs and greens with dressing; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Mound salad atop eggplant.  Garnish with nasturtium blossoms, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Make this Turkish-inspired side dish into a light summer main course by adding grilled shrimp or chicken or by simply sprinkling with goat cheese.

What to drink:  Assyrtiko (a white varietal from Greece), Pinot Grigio, or Sauvignon Blanc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    uncooked large shrimp - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, deveined
  1              large  egg
  1                     green onion -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil -- or more
                        Chili-Lime Cream Sauce -- (see recipe)

Coarsely chop shrimp in processor.  Add egg, green onion, lemon juice, mustard, cilantro, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper.  Blend in using on/off turns.  Add 1 cup panko and blend in using on/off turns.  Form mixture into twelve 3-inch-diameter cakes.  Roll cakes in remaining 1 cup panko; transfer to waxed-paper-lined baking sheet.  Refrigerate 10 minutes.  (Can be made up to 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, fry cakes until cooked through and golden brown on both sides, adding more oil to skillet as needed, about 6 minutes.

Spoon 3 tablespoons Chili-Lime Cream Sauce onto each of 6 plates.  Place 2 shrimp cakes on each and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Bonnie Hillard of Washington, DC, writes: "My sister and I stumbled across Sansei Seafood Restaurant & Sushi Bar at the end of a day of shopping at the Kapalua Shops on Maui.  We'd read about this popular spot in a guidebook, and we couldn't resist stopping in for dinner.  Everything was fabulous, especially the shrimp cakes we shared."

Market Tip:  Unseasoned Japanese breadcrumbs called panko, give these shrimp cakes a light, crispy coating.  Dry white breadcrumbs make a good substitute.  Panko is available in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets and at Asian markets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  yu choy -- bottom 2" trimmed,
  1             stalks  and leaves cut 1 1/2"-wide strips
  4               cups  cubed 3/4" peeled seeded kabocha squash
                        = (from abt one 2 3/4-lb squash)
  2               cans  unsweetened coconut milk - (13 oz ea) -- divided
     2/3           cup  Thai basil leaves - (packed) -- divided
  6              large  fresh cilantro sprigs
  3                     double-leaf kaffir lime leaves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  Thai green curry paste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced lemongrass
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar
     3/4         pound  uncooked medium-size shrimp -- peeled, deveined

Bring large saucepan of water to boil.  Add yu choy.  Cook until crisp-tender, about 1 minute.  Using strainer, transfer yu choy to colander.  Rinse with cold water and set aside.  Return water to boil.  Add squash.  Boil until almost tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.

Blend 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1/3 cup basil, cilantro, and lime leaves in mini processor or blender until herbs are finely chopped and loose paste forms.  Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shallot and curry paste; stir 30 seconds.  Add herb paste and lemongrass; stir 1 minute.  Add remaining milk, fish sauce, sugar, and squash.  Boil until squash is tender, about 4 minutes.  Add shrimp and yu choy.  Simmer until shrimp are opaque in center, about 2 minutes.  Mix in 1/3 cup basil leaves.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The mildly bitter flavor of yu choy plays nicely against the sweet curry sauce and kabocha squash.  Chinese broccoli or broccoli rabe (rapini) can be used instead.  Serve with white rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
     1/2           cup  coarsely-grated smoked cheddar cheese
  1         tablespoon  pure maple syrup -- plus
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  cream cheese -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
  4                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin
                        and tenderloin attached
     1/4           cup  Scotch whisky
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
                        === GREEN APPLE SLAW ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  pure maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  Scotch whisky
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
  1              large  Granny Smith apple -- halved, cored,
                        cut matchstick-size strips - -- (abt 2 1/2 cups)
     1/4           cup  paper-thin slices red onion
  2                     green onions -- chopped
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed

For Chicken:  Stir cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, cream cheese, and sage in small bowl to blend.  Place 1 chicken breast, skin-side down, on work surface.  Using small sharp knife, cut 1 1/2-inch-deep by 2-inch-long horizontal pocket in chicken.  Pack in 1/4 of stuffing.  Press tenderloin into pocket opening to seal in stuffing.  Repeat with remaining chicken and stuffing.  Arrange chicken on small baking sheet.

Combine 1/4 cup maple syrup, whisky, brown sugar, and butter in small saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until sauce comes to simmer and is blended.  (Chicken and basting sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

For Green Apple Slaw:  Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Mix in apple, red onion, and green onions.  Season slaw to taste with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, tossing occasionally.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rewarm basting sauce; transfer half to bowl and reserve.  Set pan with remaining sauce at edge of grill to keep warm.  Grill chicken, skin-side down, until golden, about 3 minutes.  Turn chicken over, repositioning over medium to medium-low heat.  Grill until cooked through, turning occasionally and basting with sauce in pan during last 5 minutes, about 8 minutes.  Transfer chicken to platter.  Serve with apple slaw, passing reserved sauce separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The classic apple and cheese combo gets a fun twist in this delicious dish.

What to drink:  Taz 2003 Chardonnay, Santa Barbara ($20).

For Chicken:  Stir cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, cream cheese, and sage in small bowl to blend.  Place 1 chicken breast, skin-side down, on work surface.  Using small sharp knife, cut 1 1/2-inch-deep by 2-inch-long horizontal pocket in chicken.  Pack in 1/4 of stuffing.  Press tenderloin into pocket opening to seal in stuffing.  Repeat with remaining chicken and stuffing.  Arrange chicken on small baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine 1/4 cup maple syrup, whisky, brown sugar, and butter in small saucepan.  Whisk over medium heat until sauce comes to simmer and is blended.  (Chicken and basting sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Green Apple Slaw:  Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Mix in apple, red onion, and green onions.  Season slaw to taste with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, tossing occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Rewarm basting sauce; transfer half to bowl and reserve.  Set pan with remaining sauce at edge of grill to keep warm.  Grill chicken, skin-side down, until golden, about 3 minutes.  Turn chicken over, repositioning over medium to medium-low heat.  Grill until cooked through, turning occasionally and basting with sauce in pan during last 5 minutes, about 8 minutes.  Transfer chicken to platter.  Serve with apple slaw, passing reserved sauce separately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Tender Pie Crust dough disk -- (see recipe)
                        === STREUSEL ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  sugar - (scant)
  3 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
  2 1/2         pounds  sour cherries -- pitted

Roll out pie crust disk on floured surface to 13 1/2-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold edges under.  Crimp, forming high rim (about 1/2 inch above sides of dish).  Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.

For Streusel:  Mix first 5 ingredients in bowl.  Add melted butter and vanilla; rub in with fingertips until small clumps form.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover; let stand at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 375 degrees.  Place foil-lined baking sheet in bottom of oven to catch spills.  Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl.  Add cherries; toss to coat.  Let stand until cherries begin to release juice, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer filling to chilled crust, mounding in center.  Sprinkle streusel over, covering completely and pressing to adhere.

Bake pie 20 minutes.  Tent loosely with foil.  Bake until filling bubbles thickly and streusel is golden, about 1 hour 10 minutes longer.  Cool on rack.

Comments:  Look for fresh sour cherries at farmers' markets.  Or use Bing cherries instead and add 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice to the filling.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

               Soy-Glazed Chicken Skewers With Green Onions

Recipe By     :Bird Land, Tokyo, Japan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             ounces  ground chicken breast meat
  9             ounces  ground chicken leg meat
  2              large  green onions -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  sansho powder
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce -- plus
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  16                    bamboo skewers - (10" long) -- soaked 1 hour in
                        water
  2        tablespoons  mirin
                        Shichimi togarashi -- to taste
                        = (Japanese seven-spice seasoning)

Mix first 7 ingredients and 1 teaspoon soy sauce in large bowl.  Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Brush baking sheet with water.  Using wet hands, shape generous 1/4 cup chicken mixture into 4-inch-long log.  Insert 2 skewers lengthwise into meat, each slightly off center.  Push skewers all the way through meat, leaving 3 inches of skewers exposed on each end.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and skewers to form total of 8 skewers.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Mix remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce and mirin in small bowl.  Space 2 bricks 4 1/2 inches apart and wide sides down on grill.  Working in batches, suspend skewers across bricks, allowing skewer ends to rest on bricks (meat will not touch grill).  Cook until golden, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Brush with soy sauce mixture and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute per side.  Brush with more soy sauce mixture; transfer to plates.  Sprinkle with shichimi togarashi.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  The skewers grill above the flames, suspended between two bricks to keep them from touching the grates of the barbecue.  No bricks handy?  Substitute disposable foil mini loaf pans (found on the baking aisle at the supermarket).

Ingredient Tips:  Sansho powder, made from the dried ground berries of prickly ash, has a peppery, lemony flavor.  Mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine) adds sweetness, while shichimi togarashi ó a spice blend that usually contains red chile flakes, dried orange peel, white sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, poppy seeds, nori flakes, and ginger ó lends depth of flavor.  Look for these ingredients in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets or at Japanese markets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar

  3        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1                cup  sugar
  1 3/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon -- divided
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated orange peel - (packed)
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise

                        and thinly sliced crosswise
  4          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil (such as Asian)
  1              large  avocado -- halved, peeled,
                        pitted, and cut into thin slices
  8               cups  mixed baby greens - (loosely packed)
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh mint leaves

Mix chili-garlic sauce, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in large bowl.  Add shrimp and toss to coat.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over high heat until hot.  Add half of shrimp and sautÈ until cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer shrimp to plate.  Add 1 tablespoon oil to same skillet.  Add remaining shrimp and sautÈ until cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Transfer shrimp to plate and cool.

Cook corn in pot of boiling salted water until almost tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain and cool.  Cut corn kernels off cobs.  Mix corn, tomatoes, and cucumber into shrimp.

Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, lime juice, soy sauce, and sesame oil in medium bowl.  (Shrimp mixture and dressing can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

Combine shrimp mixture with any accumulated juices, avocado, greens, and mint in large bowl.  Add dressing and toss to coat.

This recipe yields 6 main-course servings.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To prevent the avocado from turning brown, rinse the slices under cold water.  They should retain their color for up to 2 hours.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  grated lime peel
  1 1/2           cups  fresh lime juice
  1 1/4           cups  water
  3              small  melons -- halved lengthwise,
                        seeded, each half cut 8 wedges (abt 3/4"
                        wide), peeled
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh mint leaves -- plus
  8                     fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

Mix sugar, chopped mint, basil, and lime peel in medium bowl.  Mash with wooden spoon until herbs turn dark green, about 3 minutes.  Stir in lime juice and 1 1/4 cups water.  Let stand 1 hour.  Strain into large bowl, pressing on solids.  Transfer 1/2 cup lime syrup to small pitcher; cover and refrigerate.  Pour remaining lime syrup into 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking dish.  Place dish in freezer.  Stir syrup with fork every hour until frozen, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep frozen.)

Divide melon wedges among 8 shallow soup bowls.  Drizzle melon with reserved lime syrup.  Scrape granita into flakes with fork.  Spoon generous 1/2 cup granita atop melon in each bowl.  Sprinkle with sliced mint leaves, garnish with mint sprigs, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Use any combination of ripe melons that you can find.  Charentais (or Cavaillon), delicious French melons with orange flesh, are at farmers' markets now, while Galia (sweet and aromatic, similar to honeydew) and Sharlyn (a white-fleshed variety that tastes like a combination of honeydew and cantaloupe) are increasingly available at supermarkets.

                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry Sherry

  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        === KEBABS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  swordfish -- cut sixteen 1 1/2"
                        cubes
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- cut sixteen 1 1/2"
                        cubes
  8                     plum tomatoes -- halved crosswise
  2              large  peaches with skin -- halved, pitted,
                        and each half cut into 4 wedges
  16                    green onion bottoms, 3" long
  1              large  red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 16 squares
  1                     eggplant - (abt 1 lb) -- cut sixteen 1 1/2"
                        cubes
  3              small  zucchini -- trimmed, and
                        cut into sixteen 1/2"-thk rounds
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into 8 slices

For Marinade:  Whisk all ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

For Kebabs:  Place fish and lamb in separate medium glass or stainless steel bowls.  Add 2/3 cup marinade to each; toss to coat.  Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Reserve remaining marinade for basting and making sauce.

Drain fish.  Alternate 2 fish cubes, 2 tomato halves, 2 peach wedges, and 2 onion bottoms on each of 8 skewers.

Drain lamb.  Alternate 2 lamb cubes, 2 bell pepper squares, 2 eggplant cubes, and 2 zucchini rounds on each of 8 skewers.  (Kebabs can be assembled 2 hours ahead.  Arrange on 2 rimmed baking sheets.  Cover; chill.)

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray, then prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Transfer 1 cup reserved marinade to small saucepan for sauce.  Grill kebabs until slightly charred and cooked as desired, turning occasionally and basting with remaining marinade, about 8 minutes for fish and 10 minutes for lamb.  Transfer kebabs to platter.

Bring marinade in saucepan to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Whisk in butter, 1 slice at a time, allowing each to melt before adding next (do not boil).  Season butter sauce to taste with pepper.  Serve sauce with kebabs.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Swordfish or lamb ó guests can choose just one kind of kebab or both.  (Chicken can be substituted for the lamb, if you prefer.)  The same quick marinade flavors the kebabs, then gets reduced to a sauce for serving alongside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  Asian sesame oil
     1/4           cup  mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  10                    green onions -- chopped
  6             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, caps
                        cut into 1/3"-thick slices
  1              pound  choy sum or baby bok choy -- just enough of
                        bottoms cut off to separate stalks,
                        stalks and leaves cut crosswise
                        into 2"-wide strips
     1/4         pound  snow peas (strings removed) -- halved lengthwise
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into matchstick-size strips - -- (abt 1 cup)
  8             ounces  Chinese vermicelli with
                        sweet potato starch
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  3              large  shallots -- sliced thin rounds

Stir sesame seeds in heavy medium skillet over medium-low heat until lightly toasted, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to small dish.

Mix next 5 ingredients in small bowl.  Stir in green onions and 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds; season with salt and pepper.  Transfer 3 tablespoons sauce to medium bowl and mix in mushrooms; marinate 15 minutes.

Blanch choy sum, snow peas, and carrot in large pot of boiling salted water 1 minute.  Using strainer, transfer vegetables to colander.  Rinse with cold water and set aside to drain.  Return water to boil; add noodles.  Cook until just tender but still slightly chewy, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Drain, rinse with cold water, and drain again.  Using kitchen shears, cut noodles crosswise in several places.  (Sauce, mushrooms, vegetables, and noodles can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add half of shallots; stir 30 seconds.  Add mushroom mixture; sautÈ until tender, about 4 minutes.  Scrape mushroom mixture into large bowl.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium heat.  Add remaining shallots and stir 30 seconds.  Add remaining sauce and noodles.  Simmer until noodles absorb almost all sauce, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Add noodle mixture to bowl with mushrooms.  Add choy sum, snow peas, and carrot; toss.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer stir-fry to large shallow bowl.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "What really makes this Korean-inspired dish delightful is the contrast between the crisp vegetables and the soft, chewy sweet potato noodles," says Mai Pham.  Look for the noodles at Asian markets; cellophane noodles (sold in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets) also work here.  For best results, choose a thicker noodle, about the size of spaghettini.  Serve this dish at room temperature as a side or main.

Categories    : Desserts                        Pies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  chilled unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (2 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  8        tablespoons  ice water - (or more)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  apple cider vinegar

Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter; using on/off turns, process until coarse meal forms.  Add 8 tablespoons ice water and cider vinegar; blend until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough together.

Turn dough out onto work surface; divide dough in half.  Form each half into ball and flatten into disk.  Wrap disks separately in plastic; refrigerate at least 1 hour.  (Can be made ahead.  Keep dough refrigerated up to 2 days, or enclose in resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 1 month, then thaw in refrigerator overnight.  Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)

This recipe yields 2 dough disks (enough for 2 nine-inch pie crusts).

Comments:  Based on a classic p‚te brisÈe, the buttery French pastry dough used for making pies and tarts, this pie crust dough is easy to work with and wonderfully versatile.

       Triple-Chocolate Cookie And Strawberry Ice Cream Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Chef Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  chopped fresh strawberries
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  16                    frozen Triple-Chocolate Cookies -- (see recipe)

Combine strawberries, 1/3 cup sugar, and corn syrup in medium bowl.  Using potato masher, mash until puree forms; let stand 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring cream, milk, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Remove from heat.  Using electric mixer, beat yolks in medium bowl until thick and pale yellow, about 3 minutes.  Gradually beat in hot cream mixture.  Return mixture to saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until custard thickens and forms path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes (do not boil).  Strain custard into large bowl.  Cool.  Stir in strawberry mixture and vanilla.  Cover and refrigerate custard until cold, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer ice cream to container; cover and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Place 1 frozen Triple-Chocolate Cookie flat-side up on work surface.  Place 1/2 cup ice cream atop cookie.  Using offset spatula or butter knife, gently spread ice cream to cover cookie; top with another cookie, flat-side down, and press gently to adhere.  Repeat with remaining ice cream and cookies, making 8 ice cream sandwiches total.  Wrap and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.  Let ice cream sandwiches stand at room temperature 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields ice cream 8 sandwiches.

Comments:  Bake and freeze the Triple-Chocolate Cookies a day before filling them with ice cream.  For convenience, you can make the homemade ice cream up to three days in advance.  Purchased strawberry ice cream (softened slightly at room temperature until spreadable) also works in these sandwiches.

Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Continue to beat until mixture is light, pale, and creamy, about 5 minutes.  Add lukewarm melted chocolate and vanilla and beat just until blended.  Fold in dry ingredients, then chocolate chips.

Drop chocolate cookie batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Bake cookies, 1 baking sheet at a time, until tops are evenly cracked but cookies are not yet firm to touch, about 16 minutes.  Cool cookies completely on baking sheets.  Using metal spatula, carefully transfer 4 cookies to each of 4 large resealable plastic bags, arranging in single layer.  Freeze cookies overnight.  (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.)

This recipe yields about 16 cookies.

Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 oz) -- plus
                        additional for greasing
  1             medium  carrot
  1                     celery rib
  4                     trout fillets with skin - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4             medium  shallots -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/8"-thick slices - (1 cup)
  2                     fresh parsley sprigs
  5                     black peppercorns
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  dry Riesling
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        An adjustable-blade slicer
                        Tweezers or needlenose pliers

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter bottom and sides of a 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish.

Cut carrot and celery lengthwise with slicer into very thin matchsticks (less than 1/8 inch wide and 2 1/2 inches long).

Rinse trout and remove any pin bones with tweezers or needlenose pliers.  Pat dry, then sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper on fish (flesh sides only).  Arrange fillets in baking dish, skin-sides down, overlapping slightly.

Heat butter (2 tablespoons) in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook shallots, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes (do not brown).  Add carrot, celery, parsley, and peppercorns and cook, stirring, until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Add water, wine, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and boil 1 minute.  Remove skillet from heat and pour liquid over fish, then spread vegetables evenly in baking dish.  Set skillet aside.  Cover dish tightly with foil and bake until fish is just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.

Transfer fish (topped with vegetables) to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.  Pour cooking liquid with any remaining vegetables through a sieve set over a bowl.  Sprinkle vegetables from sieve over fish (discard peppercorns) and re-cover with foil.

Spoon 1 cup of strained cooking liquid into cleaned skillet.  Boil over high heat until reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 2 minutes.  Whisk cream into cornstarch until smooth, then whisk into sauce and boil, whisking, until thickened, about 1 minute.  Stir in tarragon, lemon juice, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.

Remove foil from fish and blot any liquid accumulated on platter with paper towels.  Pour sauce over fish.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  white peaches -- halved, pitted,
                        and each half cut into 4 wedges
  2              pints  peach ice cream
     3/4           cup  crËme de cassis (black-currant liqueur) -- plus
                        additional for drizzling
  2               cups  chilled brut Champagne
                        = (or sparkling wine)

Place 3 peach wedges in bottom of each of 6 tall glasses.  Top with 1 scoop ice cream, then another 3 peach wedges.  Add second scoop ice cream and top with 2 more peach wedges.  Drizzle each with 2 tablespoons crËme de cassis.  Pour 1/3 cup Champagne into each glass.  Top with 1 scoop ice cream, drizzle with additional crËme de cassis, and serve.

Comments:  This super-easy and refreshing dessert is part Kir Royale, part peach parfait.  For a very cool treat, layer the fruit and ice cream in frosty collins or pilsner glasses straight from the freezer.  Serve with iced-tea spoons.

        Ziti With Roasted Peppers, Green Olives, And Spicy Salami

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1              large  yellow bell pepper
  1              large  green bell pepper
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              small  shallot -- halved
  1                cup  pitted green olives in brine -- drained
  1                cup  fresh Italian parsley leaves
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh oregano leaves
  1              pound  ziti
  4             ounces  sliced 1/8"-thk spicy salami -- cut into
                        matchstick-size strips
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Parmesan cheese

Char bell peppers directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose peppers in paper bag and cool completely.  Peel, stem, and seed peppers.  Cut peppers lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.

With machine running, drop garlic and shallot through processor feed tube and chop coarsely.  Add olives, parsley, olive oil, and oregano and chop finely.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Peppers and olive mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate separately.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain well.  Return pasta to pot; stir in peppers and olive mixture.  Add salami and cheese; toss to combine.  Serve warm or let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Think of this flavorful medley as an antipasto pasta.  Add sides like tomato bruschetta and a romaine-radicchio salad for a fantastic summer supper.

What to drink:  A bold Sangiovese or Rioja.

Buyer's guide:  Look for brined green olives (not canned) in bins or jars in the supermarket's deli section.  Spicy salami is widely available at Italian delis and at some supermarkets.  The test kitchen used Piller's Caliente Salamil call 323-588-2100 or go to pillers.com to find a store in your area.
