              'Clean Out The Ice Box And Freezer' Jambalaya

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1              pound  andouille -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" slices
  3               cups  chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell peppers
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell peppers
  2          teaspoons  salt -- divided
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  cayenne -- divided
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless white and dark chicken meat -- cut 1" cubes
     1/2         pound  ham -- cubed
  3                     bay leaves
  3               cups  medium-grain white rice
  6               cups  water
     1/2         pound  shelled shrimp
  1                cup  chopped green onion tops only
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Heat the oil in a large cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the sausage and cook.  Add the onions, bell peppers, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the Essence, and 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne.  Stirring often, brown the vegetables and sausage until they are caramelized, about 15 minutes.  Scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to loosen any browned particles.

Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute.  Season the chicken with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cayenne.  Add the chicken, ham, and the bay leaves to the pot.  Brown the chicken for 8 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned particles.  Add the rice and stir for 2 to 3 minutes to coat evenly.

Add the water, stir to combine, and cover.  Cook over medium heat for 30 to 35 minutes, without stirring, or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed.  Add the shrimp during the last 5 minutes of cooking and cook until just pink.  Remove the pot from the heat and let stand, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the bay leaves.  Stir in the green onions and parsley, and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  anisette or sambuca
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
  1         tablespoon  aniseeds
                        Lemon Ice Cream -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 1 large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy.  Add the eggs, beating after the addition of each.  Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the anisette.  Add the vanilla and mix well.  Fold in the nuts and aniseeds.

Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each under your palms to make a log, about 12-inches in length, and 2-inches in diameter.  Place logs on the baking sheets, about 2-inches apart.  Bake until golden brown and firm, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely on the sheet.

Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.

Transfer the cookie log to a large cutting board and with a heavy knife cut into 3/4-inch thick slices.  Spread the cookies on the baking sheet.  Bake, turning halfway through cooking, until firm and crisp, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Serve with Lemon Ice Cream.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rack beef short ribs - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cut 4-oz portions
  2        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1                     dried ancho chile
  1             medium  yellow onion -- sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled and smashed
  6        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  6        tablespoons  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
  1             gallon  water
                        === CHEDDAR POLENTA ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2               cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                     bay leaf
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  polenta
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  grated cheddar cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan

Season both sides of the ribs with the ancho chile powder.  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place a roasting pan over 2 burners on the stove.  Add oil and sear ribs on all sides.  Add the soy sauce, ancho chile, onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, kosher salt, and water to the roasting pan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and tightly cover, and transfer to the oven.  Cook until the ribs are tender and fall from the bones, about 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and serve on top of the cheddar polenta, with the cooking liquid spooned over the top.

Cheddar Polenta:  In a large, heavy saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of water with the milk, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil and slowly add the polenta, whisking constantly.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often with a large wooden spoon, until the polenta thickens, about 25 minutes.

Add the butter and stir until melted.  Add the cheddar and Parmesan, and stir well.  Adjust seasoning, to taste, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

<DirT>
Place a roasting pan over 2 burners on the stove.  Add oil and sear ribs on all sides.  Add the soy sauce, ancho chile, onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, kosher salt, and water to the roasting pan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and tightly cover, and transfer to the oven.  Cook until the ribs are tender and fall from the bones, about 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and serve on top of the cheddar polenta, with the cooking liquid spooned over the top.

<DirT>
Cheddar Polenta:  In a large, heavy saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of water with the milk, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil and slowly add the polenta, whisking constantly.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often with a large wooden spoon, until the polenta thickens, about 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the butter and stir until melted.  Add the cheddar and Parmesan, and stir well.  Adjust seasoning, to taste, and serve hot.

        Bittersweet Chocolate Marquise With Orange Creme Anglaise

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  roughly-chopped toasted pistachios
  1                cup  cold heavy cream
                        === ORANGE CREME ANGLAISE ===
  2               cups  half-and-half
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise,
                        and seeds scraped
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated orange zest
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  orange-flavored liqueur
                        === CANDIED ALMOND SLIVERS ===
     1/2           cup  almond slivers
     1/2           cup  sugar

Line a lightly oiled 6-cup loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside.

In the top of a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, combine the chocolate and butter and melt until smooth, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and fold in the pistachios.  Let cool.

In a bowl fitted with an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.  Whisk about 1/3 of the cream into the cooled chocolate, then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream.  Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill it overnight.

Unwrap the terrine, invert onto a serving platter, and shake gently to release.  Remove the plastic wrap from the top and let sit at room temperature about 15 minutes to soften.  Slice into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch slices and serve with the Orange Creme Anglaise on the side, and garnish with the Candied Almond Slivers.

Orange Creme Anglaise:  In a medium saucepan, bring the half-and-half, vanilla bean and vanilla seeds, and orange zest to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla bean.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and ribbons form, about 3 minutes.  Gradually whisk in about 3/4 cup of the hot half-and-half, and whisk until well incorporated.  Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half and cook, stirring, over medium heat, until it forms a thick custard, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl set in an ice bath to chill quickly.  Add the orange flavored liqueur and stir to combine.

Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours, or overnight.  (Makes about 2 1/2 cups)

Candied Almond Slivers:  Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the almonds and lightly toast, stirring.  Add the sugar, and cook, stirring until the sugar melts and the almonds are evenly coated.  Transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet, stirring to separate the nuts.  Let cool.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the leek and carrot, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the beef, Essence, salt, and pepper, and cook until browned, about 4 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine the flour with 2 tablespoons of stock to make a slurry.  Add to the pot and stir well.  Add the remaining stock, bay leaf, and bouquet garni, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until the meat is tender, about 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Remove the bay leaf and bouquet garni and discard.  Add the parsley, and garnish with rosemary popcorn and rosemary sprigs and serve immediately.

Rosemary Popcorn:  In a deep pot, add oil and rosemary and heat until oil shimmers.  Add popcorn and cover.  Shake pan until all corn is popped.  Remove to a paper towel lined plate and season with salt.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                Butternut Squash And Italian Sausage Soup

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  butternut squash - (abt 3 lbs) -- halved, seeded
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  sweet Italian sausage -- casings removed
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage -- plus
  12             whole  sage leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh marjoram
  6               cups  light chicken stock or broth
  1           teaspoon  cider vinegar
                        = (or lemon juice)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- or more to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Lightly coat the squash halves with 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil.  Season the inside with salt and pepper and place cut-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Bake until very tender, about 45 minutes.  When the squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and reserve.  Discard the peel.

In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the remaining vegetable oil and, when hot but not smoking, add the sausage.  Cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until the onions wilted and starting to caramelize, about 6 minutes.  Add the garlic, sage and marjoram, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the cooked squash and chicken stock, stir well to combine, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

With a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor or blender, puree the soup.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean saucepan.  Add the cider vinegar and stir to combine.  Add the cream and adjust seasoning, to taste.

In a small saute pan, cook the butter over medium-high heat until it begins to turn brown around the edges.  Add the whole sage leaves and cook until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer the leaves to paper towels to drain.

Serve the soup in bowls, garnished with the crispy sage leaves.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cold cubed unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  room temperature eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh gingerroot
  3               cups  halved pitted stemmed fresh cherries
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar
     1/2           cup  brandy
  1 1/2           cups  sweetened whipped cream
  3        tablespoons  toasted crushed hazelnuts
                        Fresh mint leaves -- as garnish
     1/4           cup  potato starch
                        = (available in the kosher food section,
                        or in specialty food markets)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease two sheet pans with the 2 teaspoons of butter, and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of flour.  Knock out the excess flour, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, sift together 1/2 cup flour, potato starch and salt.  In a separate bowl, beat together the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the sugar until pale yellow and thick.  Add the vanilla to the egg yolks.

In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.  While beating, slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold 1/4 of the egg yolk mixture into the beaten egg whites.  Gradually fold the flour and remaining egg yolk mixture into the egg whites.  (The batter should be light and fluffy.)

Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.  Pipe 4-inch long strips of batter, about 1-inch apart, onto the prepared pans.  Sift a generous amount of powdered sugar on the top of the cookies, and bake until golden and set, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool.

In a large saute pan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the ginger and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the cherries, lemon juice, and brown sugar and cook, stirring, until the cherries are softened and the sugar is melted, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the brandy.  Return to the heat and flame the brandy.  When the flames subside, remove from the heat.

To assemble the dessert, form a triangle of ladyfingers in the center of 6 dessert plates.  Divide the cherries among the 4 plates, in the center of the triangle.  Drizzle the sauce over the ladyfingers.  Place a dollop of whipped cream on top of the cherries, sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts, and garnish with mint.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  pearl onions
     1/2         pound  salt pork or bacon -- diced
  1              whole  chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Original Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- quartered
     1/4         pound  cremini mushrooms -- quartered
     1/4         pound  oyster mushrooms -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  cognac
  1             bottle  dry red wine
                        = (Cote du Rhone or Pinot Noir)
  2               cups  dark chicken stock
                        Bouquet garni
                        = (3 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf, few sprigs
                        of parsley, and some black peppercorns)
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  flour
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme
  15                    toast points
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley

Bring 3 cups of water in a medium saucepan to a boil.  Add the onions and boil for 5 minutes.  Drain in a colander and refresh under cold running water.  Cut away the stem ends of the onions and slip off the skins.  Set aside.

Heat a saute pan or dutch oven, large enough to hold the chicken in one layer, over medium heat.  Add the salt pork and cook, stirring, until brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Season the flour with the Essence, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.  Lightly dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.

Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add the chicken to the fat in the pan and cook until light brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Add the pearl onions, mushrooms, and garlic and cook until onions begin to brown and the mushrooms release their liquid.

Remove the pot from the heat and carefully add the cognac.  With a match, ignite the cognac, return to the heat and cook for 1 minute, until flames die out and the alcohol cooks off.

Add the wine and cook, stirring to deglaze the pan. Add the stock to cover the chicken and the bouquet garni, bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pot and place on a large serving platter.

Make a beurre manie by combining the butter with 1 tablespoon of the flour, mixing well.  Return the pan with the wine to the heat and bring to a boil to reduce slightly.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the beurre manie.  Continue whisking until the paste has been absorbed and the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.  Reseason to taste with salt and pepper.  Add the chicken, thyme and reserved salt pork to the pan and cook until heated through and the flavors are blended, about 5 minutes.

Dip the tips of the toast points in the parsley to coat.  Serve with the parsley dipped croutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  sugar
                        Finely-grated bittersweet chocolate -- as garnish

For the Pie Crust:  In a medium bowl using a pastry blender or fork, mix together the flour, butter, shortening, and salt until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water and mix just until the water is incorporated.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Remove from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry to a large round, about 12-inches in diameter.  Transfer to a deep dish 9-inch pie pan, trim to within 1/2-inch of the pan, and crimp decoratively.  Prick with a fork, cover, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line the shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the paper and bake until golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

Filling:  In the top of a double-boiler, or in a metal bowl set over a pot of barely simmering water, melt the bittersweet and unsweetened chocolates and butter, stirring, until smooth.  Remove from the heat.

In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until thick and pale yellow.

In a medium, heavy saucepan, heat milk.  Add 1 cup of the hot milk mixture to the yolks and whisk until smooth.  Add the beaten yolk mixture to the saucepan with the hot milk and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.  Whisk in the cornstarch and salt and cook over very low heat until thickened.  Simmer, whisking constantly, until thick and smooth, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the melted chocolate and vanilla.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down on the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and cool completely.  Pour the filling into the crust and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or overnight.

Meringue:  In a large non-reactive bowl using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and salt until soft peaks start to form.  Slowly add the sugar while beating and continue to beat until glossy and stiff peaks form.  (Be careful not to overbeat, as will be difficult to spread.)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Spread the meringue over the chocolate pie, smoothing out to the pastry edges (so the meringue won't draw up during baking).  With a dull knife, make decorative peaks in the meringue.  Bake until the meringue is golden, about 14 to 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.  Sprinkle with grated chocolate, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COUNTRY STYLE PORK RIBS ===
  6             pounds  country-style pork ribs
     1/2           cup  liquid crab boil
  1                     garlic head -- cut in 2 pieces
  2                     celery ribs -- cut 3" lengths
  1              large  onion -- quartered
  2                     carrots -- washed, ends
                        trimmed, and quartered
  3                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
                        === BARBECUE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2              small  onions -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  crushed toasted cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  2               cups  ketchup
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated horseradish
  1                cup  malt or cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar
  4          teaspoons  Worcestershire Sauce

In a large pot, combine all the rib ingredients and enough water to cover by 1-inch (about 12 cups) and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to a slow boil, cover the pot, and cook for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until ribs are very tender when pierced with a fork.

While the ribs are cooking, prepare the BBQ sauce.  In a medium, non-reactive saucepan, over medium-high heat, heat the oil.  Add the onions, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, cumin and cayenne pepper and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the ketchup, horseradish, cider vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce and stir to mix well.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened and the flavors have married, about 20 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to broil.  Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil.  Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the ribs to one of the prepared pans.  Blot any excess liquid with paper towels, and discard the vegetables and cooking liquid.  Spread half of the BBQ sauce over the 2nd lined pan.  Lay the ribs flat over the sauce, and spoon the remaining sauce over the ribs to coat generously.  Broil until the sauce is caramelized, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     beef tenderloin - (abt 3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- trimmed, tied
     1/2           cup  Creole mustard
                        = (or other spicy whole-grained mustard)
  8                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1              bunch  fresh rosemary -- finely chopped
  1              bunch  fresh thyme -- finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Season beef on all sides generously with salt and pepper and transfer meat to the skillet.  Cook beef until well-browned on all sides, turning with tongs when necessary.

Transfer the beef to a cutting board or platter and, using a rubber spatula or spoon, rub all over with Creole mustard and garlic.  Cover meat with chopped herbs, using your hands to evenly pat herbs into the mustard coating.  Place prepared meat in a shallow roasting pan and cook about 20 to 25 minutes, or until meat registers 125 degrees on a meat thermometer for medium-rare.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  vanilla wafers - (12 oz)
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  whole milk
  3              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  banana extract
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  4          teaspoons  dark rum
  3                     ripe bananas -- sliced crosswise
                        === CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts -- for garnish

Line the bottom and sides of a 9- by 9-inch square baking dish with the vanilla wafers.  Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and flour.  Add the milk, whisk, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, whisking constantly, until thick, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs.  Gradually whisk about 3/4 cup of the hot milk into the egg.  Return the egg mixture to the saucepan with the hot milk and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, whisking constantly, until smooth and thick, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the butter, vanilla, and banana extract.  Whisk until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.  Transfer to a clean bowl and cool to room temperature.

In a bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks begin to form.  Add the sugar and whip until stiff peaks start to form.  Add the rum and whip to incorporate.  Set aside.

Pour half of the pudding over the vanilla wafers, top with the bananas.  Add the remaining pudding, smoothing it over the sliced bananas.  Top with the whipped cream, and smooth with the back of a spoon.  Drizzle chocolate sauce over the cream and top with walnuts.

Cover tightly and chill at least 2 hours before serving.

Chocolate Sauce:  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the cream to a bare simmer over low heat.  Place the chocolate pieces in a medium bowl.  Whisk the cream slowly into the chocolate.  Add the vanilla and continue whisking until the chocolate melts and the sauce thickens.

Let the sauce cool to room temperature before pouring over the Banana Pudding.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 10 servings.

     1/2           cup  duck stock
                        = (or chicken stock)
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
  1           teaspoon  lavender
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  toasted skinned chopped hazelnuts -- as garnish
                        === NUTTY WILD RICE ===
  1            package  wild rice - (8 oz)
                        Chicken stock -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  toasted skinless chopped hazelnuts
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Cook and Pair with Schramsberg Brut Rose Sparkling Wine

Score the fatty side of the duck breasts and lightly season with salt, pepper, and Essence on both sides.  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the duck breasts and sear on the fatty side for 4 minutes.  Turn and cook on the other side for 2 minutes, for medium-rare.  Remove from the skillet and cover to keep warm.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the wine, stock, cherries, lavender, honey, and thyme, and bring to a simmer, stirring to scrape up any bits clinging to the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the cherries are plump and the liquid is reduced to a thick sauce, about 4 minutes.  Add the butter in pieces, stirring constantly to incorporate.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Return the duck breasts to the pan with any accumulated pan juices and cook over low heat until warmed through, about 1 minute.

Transfer to 4 serving plates and spoon the sauce and cherries over each portion.  Garnish with the toasted nuts and serve with the Nutty Wild Rice.

Nutty Wild Rice:  Cook the rice according to package directions, using chicken stock instead of water, and adding 1 tablespoon of butter to the stock.  When all the liquid has been absorbed, remove from the heat and let rest for at least 10 minutes.  Fluff with a fork and add the nuts and parsley.  Season to taste, as necessary.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  eggplant -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/3" thick rounds
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus more as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  1              pound  Italian sausage -- casings removed
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                can  whole Italian tomatoes - (28 oz) -- crushed, and
                        their juices
  1           teaspoon  Italian seasonings
     1/2           cup  pitted black olives -- coarsely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4           cup  minced fresh basil leaves
  4        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  whole milk
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  8             ounces  ziti -- cooked according
                        to package directions and drained
  1                cup  grated mozzarella

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish and set aside.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1/4 cup of the oil.  Add the eggplant in batches, seasoning on both sides with salt and pepper, and cook until golden, adding more oil as needed.  Transfer to a plate as they cook, and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot but not smoking, add the onion and sausage, and cook, stirring, until the sausage is browned and the onion is soft, about 6 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, their juices, the Italian seasoning, black olives, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the crushed red pepper.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer, uncovered, until the flavors marry and the sauce slightly thickens, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Add the basil and adjust seasoning, to taste.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and forms a light roux, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the milk and, whisking frequently, cook until the sauce is thickened and smooth, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and season with the nutmeg and salt and pepper, to taste.

Arrange half of the eggplant slices on the bottom of the casserole, overlapping as necessary.  Top with half of the cooked pasta, then half of the sausage-tomato sauce.  Place another layer of eggplant slices on top of the sauce, then layers of pasta and sausage-tomato sauce.  Pour on the white sauce, then top with the grated mozzarella and Parmesan.

Bake for 1 hour, or until puffed and golden brown on top.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme
  1              pound  cooked lobster meat -- cut bite-size pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
  1                     egg yolk -- lightly beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water

In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until wilted and golden brown around the edges, about 5 minutes.  Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 1 minute.  Add the cognac and cook until almost completely evaporated.

Sprinkle the flour over the top of the mushrooms and shallots, stir to combine well, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp stock and milk, and whisk until smooth.  Continue to cook until thickened.

Add the heavy cream, green peas, salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme, and cook for 15 minutes, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and the flavors have come together.  Set aside until cooled.

Add the lobster meat, chives, and tarragon.  Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, then divide lobster mixture evenly among four 12-ounce ramekins.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll puff pastry to a thickness of 1/8-inch.  Using a decorative cutter, cut the pastry into circles 3/4-inch larger than the diameter of the ramekins.  Transfer the dough rounds to the top of the ramekins and press the edges of the pastry around the top of the dishes.  With a pastry brush, lightly coat the top of the pastry with some of the egg yolk mixture.  Using the tip of a paring knife, cut  slits in the center of the pastry for the steam to escape.

Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until pastry is puffed and golden brown and sauce is bubbling hot.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings, or 8 first course servings, in smaller ramekins.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  sliced bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
  1              pound  cremini or button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and thinly sliced
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  minced shallots
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary leaves
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  rich beef stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef -- such as chuck
     3/4        pounds  ground veal
     1/2        pounds  ground pork
  2                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        === ROAST GARLIC MASHED POTATOES ===
  3                     garlic heads -- top 1/2" cut away
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  russets or Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  heavy cream

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until most of the fat is rendered but it is not yet crisp.  Transfer the bacon to the bowl of a food processor and set aside.  Remove all but 3 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet.  Reserve the additional rendered bacon fat in a small bowl and set aside.

Add the chopped onions to the fat in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and caramelized around the edges, about 6 minutes.  Combine the onions with the bacon in the bowl of the food processor and process until smooth.  Transfer to a large bowl and set aside to cool.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the remaining bacon fat in the pan.  Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon of the salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have released their liquid and are golden brown around the edges, about 5 minutes.  Add the minced shallots, thyme, and rosemary, and cook until the shallots are soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the red wine and cook until almost completely evaporated.

Sprinkle the flour over the shallots and mushrooms, and stir to combine.  Cook for 1 minute.  Add the beef stock and cook for 5 minutes, until thickened.  Add 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, stir to combine, and cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and the flavors come together, about 6 minutes.  Cover and keep hot while you prepare the meat patties.

Preheat the broiler to 500 degrees.

In the mixing bowl with the pureed onion-bacon mixture, add the beef, veal, pork, remaining 2 tablespoons of heavy cream, egg yolks, mustard, Worcestershire Sauce, garlic, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and pepper, and mix lightly but thoroughly.

Shape into 6 oval patties, about 1 cup each, and 1-inch thick, and transfer to a nonstick baking sheet or broiling pan.  Broil the patties close to the heat source, about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

Add the meat pan drippings, butter, and chives to the sauce and stir until the butter is thoroughly incorporated.  Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Serve the patties immediately with the Roast Garlic Mashed Potatoes, with some of the mushroom sauce ladled over the top.

Roast Garlic Mashed Potatoes:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the garlic on a pie pan and drizzle with the oil.  Season lightly with salt and pepper, and roast for until the garlic is very tender and golden brown, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  When cool enough to handle, squeeze the head to release the cloves into a small bowl.  Use a fork to mash the garlic until smooth.

Place the potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt in a medium pot and cover with water by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until fork tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain in a colander.  Return to the saucepan over medium heat and cook 1 minute.  Reduce the heat to low, add the mashed garlic and butter, and mash using a hand-held masher.  Add the cream and continue to mash until thoroughly combined and the desired consistency is reached.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 generous servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- for frying
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)
  6             ounces  finely-chopped country ham
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  chopped mixed soft fresh herbs
                        = (such as parsley, chives, chervil,
                        basil, and tarragon)
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Sift the flour and salt into a medium bowl.  Add 6 tablespoons of the cold butter and mix with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time and mix until the dough comes together and is no longer dry, being careful not to overmix.  Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 10-inches in diameter.  Transfer to a tart pan with a removable bottom and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line the pastry with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake until the crust is set, about 12 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights and bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

In a skillet, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the ham and cook until beginning to color and the fat is rendered, about 3 minutes.  Add the shallots and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and spoon into the bottom of the tart.

In a bowl, beat together the eggs and egg yolks.  Add the cream and beat well.  Add the mixed herbs, thyme, salt, and pepper, and mix well.  Pour into the tart shell and bake until the top is golden and the filling is set, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves -- rinsed well,
                        and patted dry
  2               cups  red-wine vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  watercress -- washed, spun dry
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  apple-smoked bacon -- diced
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
  1                cup  thinly-sliced Granny Smith apples
  2        tablespoons  honey
  4                     blue fish fillets, 1/2" thick - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Original Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt

                        Fresh basil sprigs -- as garnish
     1/2           cup  apple cider vinegar

Place the watercress in a large heatproof bowl and set aside.  Preheat the grill.

Place a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the olive oil and when hot, add the bacon.  Cook, stirring often, until most of the fat has been released and the bacon is crispy, about 6 minutes.

Add the shallots and garlic, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the walnuts and cook until just toasted, stirring, about 1 minute.  Add the apples and honey and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes.

Season the blue fish filets on both sides with the Essence, and 1 teaspoon of salt.  Place on the grill and cook for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes per side.

Season the bacon apple mixture with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper, and the basil.  Add the vinegar and reduce by half, about 30 seconds.  Remove the dressing from the heat and pour over the watercress.

Season the watercress with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  Toss well to coat and divide the watercress among 4 plates.  Place the fish on top of the watercress, and garnish with the fresh basil sprigs.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  6             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
     1/4           cup  minced green onions
                        = (green and white parts)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  36                    won ton or egg roll wrappers
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        === ORIENTAL DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  grated carrots
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  crunchy peanut butter
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        === HOT MUSTARD SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  dry Chinese hot mustard
  3        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  1              pinch  salt

Put the ham hocks in a large saucepan and add 12 cups of water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered, for 2 hours.  Remove the pan from heat and drain the ham hocks in a colander.

When the ham hocks are cool enough to handle, remove the skin, and discard along with the bones.  Coarsely chop the meat, which should yield about 1 1/4 cups.  Put the chopped ham in a large mixing bowl.  Add the goat cheese and blend with a fork, then add the green onions, olive oil, parsley, garlic, salt, and black pepper.  Stir to mix well.

Lay 12 won ton wrappers on a flat work surface and place a cup of water nearby.  Place a generous teaspoon of the meat mixture in the middle of each wrapper.  With a fingertip, rub a bit of water along the 4 edges of the wrapper and fold in half, pressing down on the outer edges to seal.  Repeat with the remaining wrappers and meat mixture.  (The filled won tons can be covered tightly with plastic wrap and kept refrigerated for 2 hours before frying.)

Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy pot or electric fryer, to 350 degrees.  Add the won tons, about 10 to 12 at a time, and fry, stirring occasionally, until they float to the top and are golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove the fried won tons with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel line baking sheet.  Serve immediately, alone or with dipping sauce of choice.

Oriental Dipping Sauce:  Combine the ingredients in a bowl and whisk until well blended.  Set aside until needed, stirring well to re-combine before serving.  The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.  (Makes 1 cup)

Hot Mustard Sauce:  Put the mustard in a small bowl and slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup water and whisk to make a thin paste.  Add the vinegar and salt, and whisk well to blend.  Set aside until needed, and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week, stirring as needed before serving.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields about 36 dumplings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     ham hocks - (1/2 lb ea) -- scored
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  minced yellow onions
     1/4           cup  minced celery
     1/4           cup  minced green bell pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              pound  navy beans -- rinsed, picked over,
                        soaked overnight and drained
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
     1/2           cup  minced green onions

In a large, heavy stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the ham hocks, onions, celery, bell pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, thyme and bay leaves, and saute until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, and saute for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer covered for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Add the navy beans and stir.  Continue simmering over medium-low heat for 45 minutes to one hour, or until the beans are almost cooked and ham hocks are very tender.  Season with salt and continue cooking 15 to 30 minutes, until beans are done and ham hocks are beginning to fall apart.

Remove from the heat.  Serve the ham hocks with the beans at the table, sprinkled with parsley and green onions, or cut the meat from the bones in the kitchen before serving, return the meat to the pot and serve with the beans at the table.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  orange blossom honey
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange peel
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted dates
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted walnuts
                        Orange-Honey Butter -- (see recipe)

Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.

Lightly butter a standard 12-cup muffin pan with the 2 teaspoons of butter.  Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, cream together the remaining 1 stick of butter and honey until fluffy.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating after the inclusion of each.  Add the buttermilk and orange peel, and beat to combine.

Stir in the dry ingredients until just combined, being careful not to overmix the batter.  Fold in the dates and nuts.  Divide the batter among the prepared cups of the muffin tin.

Bake until golden brown and a tester inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and turn out onto wire racks to cool.  Serve with Orange Honey Butter.

This recipe yields 12 muffins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEER SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots

  1                cup  porter

  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and cut
                        into 1" cubes and blanched until tender
  3        tablespoons  Creole mustard

  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  pork sausage -- removed from casings
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- more as needed
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
     1/2           cup  chopped green or red bell peppers
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              large  Idaho potato -- peeled, cubed
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1                cup  chicken stock
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  shredded sharp cheddar
                        Hot toast or tortillas -- for accompaniment

Heat an electric skillet or large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 3 minutes.  Add the butter, and when melted, add the onions, bell peppers, 1 teaspoon of the Essence, the hot sauce, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the potatoes (and additional butter if needed to prevent sticking), and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.  Add the parsley and chicken stock, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes are soft and stock is absorbed, about 10 minutes.

With a spoon, make 4 indentations in the mixture, and break an egg into each.  Cover and cook until the eggs are set, about 4 minutes.  Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of Essence and the cheese.  Serve immediately with hot toast or tortillas.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lamb fillet, shoulder or leg -- trimmed of fat,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  diced peeled sweet potatoes
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled seeded Italian plum -- (1 or 2 tomatoes)
                        tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  herbes de Provence -- (listed below)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  dry red wine
  3               cups  lamb or beef stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium beef broth)
                        French or Italian bread -- accompaniment
                        === HERBES DE PROVENCE ===
     1/4           cup  dried thyme
     1/4           cup  dried majoram
     1/4           cup  dried savory
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  dried rosemary
  1           teaspoon  dried lavender blossoms

Season the meat with the Essence and use your hands to coat the meat thoroughly.  In a large dutch oven or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the seasoned lamb and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate, and set aside.

To the fat in the pan, add the onions, potatoes, and carrots, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes, herbs, salt, pepper, and red wine, and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Add the lamb and stock to the pan and return to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the lamb is tender, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Ladle into soup bowls and serve with hot, crusty French or Italian bread.

Herbes de Provence:  Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.  Store in an airtight container and use as needed.  (Makes almost 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  half-and-half
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated fresh lemon zest
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  limoncello
                        = (or other lemon-flavored liqueur or
                        grappa)

In a medium, heavy saucepan, bring the cream, half-and-half, sugar, and zest to a boil, stirring occasionally until the sugar is melted.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks until thick and pale, about 2 minutes.  In a slow stream, whisking constantly, add about 1 cup of the hot cream mixture to the egg yolks.  Beat until well incorporated.

Return the yolk mixture to the saucepan with the hot cream and bring to a bare simmer.  Cook until a thick custard forms, and the mixture reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes.

Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean container.  Stir in the lemon juice and limoncello, and cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the custard to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well-chilled, about 2 hours.

Transfer to an ice-cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight plastic container and freeze until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  lime zest
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  1                     egg yolk
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  coarse sugar
                        === CHERRY COMPOTE ===
  1              pound  cherries -- washed, pitted,
                        and halved
     3/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  lime juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  kirsch
                        = (or orange flavored-liqueur)
  1                cup  sweetened whipped cream

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Add the butter to the dry ingredients and cut into the flour using your hands or a pastry-cutter until it resembles small peas.  Add the lime zest and buttermilk and mix just until the liquid is incorporated, being careful not to over mix.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk with the milk.  With a large spoon, drop dollops of the dough onto the prepared pan.  Brush the tops of the dough with the egg wash, and sprinkle with the sugar.  Bake until risen and golden, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve hot with the Cherry Compote and whipped cream.

Cherry Compote:  In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries, water, lime juice, and sugar.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and kirsch and add to the cherry mixture.  Return to a boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 4 minutes.  Serve warm with the Lime-Scented Scones and whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 scones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  Essence -- plus more
                        for dusting turkey
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
                        = (or canned chicken stock)
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  fresh breadcrumbs
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                     boneless skinless turkey breast - (3 lbs)
                        = (a 6-pound breast may be halved)
     1/2         pound  Homemade Linguica -- (see recipe)
                        Buttered Egg Noodles -- (see recipe)

In a medium skillet over medium-high, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil and, when hot, add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, scallions, Essence, and chicken broth, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute longer.  Add the melted butter, bread crumbs, parsley, sage, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, and cayenne pepper, and mix well.  Transfer to a mixing bowl to cool slightly.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place turkey breast half on a flat work surface covered with plastic wrap and, using a sharp knife, cut a deep slit all the way down one side, being careful not to cut through to the other side.  Fold the flap of turkey outward so that the breast resembles an open book.  Place a second piece of plastic wrap on top of the turkey, then use a meat cleaver or other heavy object to pound the breast to a uniform 1/2-inch thickness.

Season the inside of the turkey breast with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and Essence, to taste.  Spread the breadcrumb mixture over the top of the breast to within 1/2-inch of the edges.  Place the sausage link lengthwise over the stuffing.  Carefully fold one edge of the breast over the top of the sausage, and repeat with the other side so the breast can be rolled into a neat parcel.  Tie at 1-inch intervals with kitchen twine.  Rub the outside of the turkey breast with the 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then season with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.

Heat a large oven-proof skillet over high heat.  When hot, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and when hot, sear the stuffed turkey breast, turning occasionally to brown on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 30 minutes, or until juices run clear and the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes.  Remove the kitchen twine, slice into 1/2-inch slices, and serve with Buttered Egg Noodles.

                        finely chopped
  1 3/4           cups  grated sharp cheddar cheese

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to get hot.

In a large skillet, fry the bacon over medium-high heat until brown, about 6 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Drain all the fat but 2 teaspoons.  Return to medium-high heat and add the corn.  Cook, stirring, until golden and tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the cream, butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and water, and cook until thick and creamy, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and mash with a potato masher to crush some of the corn.  Let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, remaining salt, and cayenne.  Stir to combine.

In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons of the melted butter.  Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.  In a separate bowl, combine the cooled cream corn, bacon, jalapeÒos, and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese, and mix well.

Remove the skillet from the oven and add the remaining tablespoon of melted butter, tilting the skillet to coat the bottom and sides.  Pour half of the batter into the bottom of the skillet.  Top with the corn-cheese mixture, then top with the remaining half of the batter.  Bake until golden brown and set, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves - -- (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, squeezed dry
  1                cup  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped drained oil-packed
                        sun-dried tomatoes
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted, halved
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2                     tablespooons chopped fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh thyme
  4             ounces  goat cheese or feta -- crumbled

Prepare a grill, or preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Prepare 4 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil to measure about 12 by 15 inches.  Fold in half crosswise to crease, then unfold.  Divide the spinach among the 4 foil sheets, placing it in the center of the bottom half.

Lightly coat both sides of each chicken breast with oil, then season with the Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper.  Place one chicken fillet in the center of each spinach portion.

In a medium bowl, combine the onions, tomatoes, olives, garlic, wine, basil, thyme, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and stir to combine.  Pile the tomato mixture on top of each chicken breast, spreading to cover evenly and allow any liquid to puddle around the chicken.  Top each portion with 1 ounce of cheese.

One at a time, fold the top of the foil over the chicken, and starting at the corner, fold the edges of foil over to tightly seal, each fold overlapping the previous one.  Place on the grill, or if using the oven, place the packets on a baking sheet and bake until the packages puff and the chicken is cooked through, about 12 minutes.

Remove from the grill or oven, and cut the tops of the packets open with a small, sharp knife.  Serve immediately either in the foil packets, or by removing the chicken, toppings and sauce to dinner plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     poblano chile peppers - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  1 1/2         pounds  Mexican chorizo
                        = (or other hot sausage) -- removed from
                        casings and crumbled
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell peppers
  4          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4          teaspoons  chili powder
  5                     corn tortillas -- quartered
  10             large  eggs
  3               cups  half-and-half
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped green onion tops only
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1 1/2           cups  grated pepper jack
  1 1/2           cups  grated medium cheddar
                        Sour Cream -- for garnish
                        Picante Sauce - (store bought) -- for garnish

Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, split in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds and the stems.

Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Spread the chiles in a flat layer across the bottom of the dish.

In a large skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat, stirring to break up the meat, until browned.  Add the onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and chili powder, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and half-and-half with the hot sauce, salt and black pepper.

In another bowl, combine the green onions, cilantro, jack, and cheddar, and mix well.

Spoon 1/3 of the sausage mixture over the chiles in the dish, top with 1/3 of the tortilla quarters, and 1/3 of the cheese mixture.  Repeat layering, ending with a cheese layer.  Pour the egg mixture over the ingredients.  Let rest, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bake until bubbly and golden brown, and a knife inserted into the custard comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let rest 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with sour cream and picante sauce.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unsalted butter -- plus
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  4          teaspoons  all-purpose flour -- divided, plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  cold heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  cold heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  nut-flavored liqueur
     1/2          pint  fresh raspberries
  4             sprigs  mint
                        Sweetened cocoa -- as garnish

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Grease and flour 4 (6-ounce) ramekins or baking dishes with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of butter and 1 teaspoon of flour in each, tapping out the excess flour.  Set on a baking sheet.

In a double boiler, or a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, melt the remaining 1/4 pound of butter with the chocolate, cream, and powdered sugar, stirring until smooth.  Remove from the heat.

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, and salt until thick ribbons form, about 3 minutes.  Sift 2 tablespoons flour into the egg mixture and fold together.  Fold the chocolate into the egg mixture.  Divide among the prepared dishes and bake until the sides of the cake are set and the tops are puffed but still soft, about 12 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool in the ramekins for 2 minutes, then unmold onto dessert plates.

Meanwhile, in a bowl whip the cream until beginning to form soft peaks.  Add the sugar and nut liqueur and beat until stiff peaks start to form.  Spoon a dollop of the whipped cream on each unmolded cake, and garnish each plate with raspberries and a sprig of mint.  Sprinkle cocoa over the cakes, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fiddlehead ferns
  2                     shallots -- minced
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  fresh morels -- trimmed, rinsed well
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmesan curls -- for garnish

In a saucepan, bring 1 1/2 quarts of salted water to a boil.  Add fiddleheads and return to a boil.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer fiddleheads to an ice bath and chill.  Drain and pat dry, removing as much of the outer brown, tissue-like membrane as possible.

In a skillet saute shallots in butter until softened, about 2 minutes.  Add thyme, morels, and garlic and continue to cook until morels have softened and given up their liquid, about 3 minutes.  Continue to cook until almost all liquid is evaporated, about 2 more minutes.

Add chicken stock and cook until reduced by half.  Add fiddleheads and cook 2 minutes, add cream, chives, and parsley, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.  Serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan curls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     bacon slices -- roughly chopped
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut into strips
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou blast recipe)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
     1/4           cup  minced green onions
                        Cheesy Rice Pilaf -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley -- for garnish

In an electric skillet or a large heavy skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 5 minutes.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels.

Season the chicken with the Essence, and add to the fat in the pan.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  tomatoes
     1/2           cup  white raisins
  8             ounces  orzo
  1                cup  feta or goat cheese -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/2           cup  chopped seeded cucumber
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste

Cut off about 1/2-inch from the top of each tomato.  With a finger, scoop out the seed pockets and, over the sink, remove the seeds and juice.  With a small sharp knife, remove the inner pulp and discard or save for another use.  Place the tomatoes upside down on a rack to drain.

In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of water to a boil.  Place the raisins in a small bowl and add the boiling water.  Let sit until plumped up, about 5 minutes.  Drain and set aside to cool.

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the orzo and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold running water.  Drain well.

In a large bowl, combine the cooled pasta, raisins, feta, green onions, cucumbers, pine nuts, mint, olive oils, and lemon juice, and toss to combine.  Add salt, to taste.  Scoop the mixture into the tomato shells and serve.

  2             pounds  red bliss potatoes -- scrubbed well,
                        patted dry, skins left on
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Using a mandolin or very sharp, heavy knife, slice the potatoes into rounds as thin as possible, and place in a large bowl of water to prevent discoloration.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot to between 340 and 350 degrees.

Pat the potatoes completely dry.  Add to the oil in batches and cook until golden brown, stirring with a long handled spoon to turn and cook evenly, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and place in a large bowl.  Toss with the cheese, truffle oil, salt, and pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/4           cup  prepared horseradish
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fusilli or penne
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/4           cups  chopped red bell peppers
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2               cups  vegetable stock
                        = (or canned vegetable broth)
  1                can  chickpeas - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  8             ounces  fresh baby spinach -- rinsed well,
                        and stems removed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  cubed mozzarella
     1/2           cup  grated asiago

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes.  Drain well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED GRAVY ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  5               cups  chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  1           teaspoon  salt

  2        tablespoons  whole fennel seeds
  2               cans  tomato paste - (6 oz ea)
  4               cans  tomato sauce - (15 oz ea)
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- pureed with
                        their juice
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === SAUSAGE MEATBALLS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chuck
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet Italian sausage -- casings removed
  1              pound  hot Italian sausage -- casings removed
  10                    garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  4          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1              pound  spaghetti -- cooked according
                        to package directions
  1                cup  grated Parmesan -- garnish

In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, Italian seasoning, salt, and red pepper, and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft, 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and fennel, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until paste begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomato sauce, pureed tomatoes, 2 1/2 cups of water, and Essence, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, sweet sausage, hot sausage, garlic, eggs, Essence, salt, and black pepper, and mix briefly but thoroughly to distribute seasonings.  Shape into meatballs and set aside, refrigerated.

Add the meatballs to the sauce and do not stir until the meatballs float to the top of the sauce, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Stir well, and simmer the meatballs in the sauce for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and skimming any fat that rises to the surface.  Taste, adjust seasoning as necessary, and serve immediately over hot pasta.  Pass the grated Parmesan at the table.

This recipe yields 4 hearty servings, plus enough leftover meatballs and gravy for 4 meatball sandwiches the next day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  creme fraiche
                        = (or 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup
                        heavy cream well combined)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  36                    oysters -- shucked
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  anise-flavored liqueur
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and cut into thin strips
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  2             ounces  Sevruga caviar

Combine the creme fraiche, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper in a small bowl, and mix well.  Transfer to a fine mesh strainer and place over a bowl.  Let the mixture drain, refrigerated, for up to 2 hours.  Cover until needed.

Drain the oysters in a fine mesh strainer over a bowl, and reserve their liquid to equal 1 1/2 cups.

Melt the butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add cayenne pepper.  Add the heavy cream, the 1 1/2 cups oyster liquor, and the liqueur, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and reduce the heat to medium.  Simmer until reduced by 50 percent in volume, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Add half of the spinach to the cream and puree with an immersion blender, or in batches in a blender or food processor.  Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a large clean saute pan, and keep warm.

Heat the oil in a medium stockpot to 350 degrees.

Add the remaining spinach to the pot in batches and fry until crispy, about 45 seconds.  With a slotted spoon remove the cooked spinach and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt to taste.

Add the oysters to the sauce and bring to a gentle simmer.  Cook until the edges of the oysters start to curl, about 3 minutes, depending upon their size.  Remove from the heat.

To serve, arrange 6 oysters around the inner edge of a shallow, rimmed soup bowl like the spokes of a wheel, and spoon 1/2 cup of sauce around the oysters.

Spoon a dollop of Black Pepper Creme Fraiche into the center of the bowl, top with a teaspoon of the Beluga caviar, and garnish with fried spinach.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Mushrooms                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  4              large  fresh portobello mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and stems removed
  4                     thick Vidalia onion slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  Gorgonzola -- thinly sliced
  4              large  whole-wheat hamburger buns
                        = (or large kaiser rolls)
  1              bunch  watercress -- rinsed, dried,
                        stems removed
                        === LEMON AIOLI ===
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, oil, garlic, and rosemary.  Place the mushrooms in a large re-sealable plastic bag, or a baking dish, and cover with the marinade.  Marinate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.

Prepare the grill.

Remove the mushrooms from the marinade and pat dry.  Season both sides with salt and pepper, and place gill sides-down on the grill.  Cook for 5 minutes, then turn.  Arrange the cheese and onion slices on the gills of each mushroom and continue to cook until tender, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Open the rolls and lightly toast on the grill, insides down.

Place 1 grilled mushroom inside each bun and garnish each, to taste, with Lemon Aioli.  Divide the watercress among the 4 buns and serve immediately.

Lemon Aioli:  With the back of a knife, mince the garlic, then crush.  Gradually work the salt into the crushed garlic to make a paste.  Place in a bowl.  Whisk the eggs and lemon juice with the garlic paste and incorporate.  Add the cayenne.  Slowly whisk in the oil, a little at a time, until all the oil is incorporated and the mixture emulsifies.  Keep refrigerated until ready to use.  Use within 24 hours.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2              large  yellow onions -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" chunks
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                     bay leaf
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  light cream
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  crumbled Roquefort
                        = (or other creamy blue cheese)
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  Tawny Port
  6             slices  bacon -- cooked, crumbled
                        === BLUE CHEESE AND WALNUT CRUMPETS ===
  5             ounces  Roquefort -- crumbled
                        = (or other creamy blue cheese)
  5          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  4          teaspoons  Tawny Port
  7          teaspoons  chopped walnuts
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  8                     crumpets or English muffins -- split
  16                    walnut halves

In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until just beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the potatoes, salt, pepper, cayenne, and bay leaf, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until the potatoes are tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Remove from the heat and puree with a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor, until smooth.  Add the light and heavy creams, and stir well to blend.  Gently reheat and barely simmer, being careful not to boil.  Add 3/4 cup of the cheese, the thyme, and Port, and whisk until the cheese is just melted.  Adjust the seasonings, to taste.

Ladle the soup into bowls, and top each with some of the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese and the crumbled bacon.  Serve immediately with the Blue Cheese and Walnut Crumpets.

Blue Cheese and Walnut Crumpets:  In a bowl, cream together the cheese and butter.  Add the Port, walnuts, and salt, and mix until creamy.

Lightly toast each crumpet or muffin half.  Spread about 1 heaping tablespoon of the cheese mixture onto each of the 16 crumpet or muffin halves and top each with half a walnut.  Toast until just bubbling.  Serve immediately with the Potato, Onion, and Roquefort Soup.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        === SAUTEED BANANAS AND GINGER SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  coarsely-grated ginger
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  ripe bananas -- cut in half, and
                        halved lengthwise
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream -- softened

For the pound cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Grease a 9- by 4- by 3-inch baking pan with 1 teaspoon of butter, then lightly flour with 2 teaspoons of the flour.

Sift the remaining 2 cups of flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl, and set aside.

Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and cream on high speed.  Add the dry ingredients to the bowl, alternating with the eggs, beating on low speed, and scraping the sides of the bowl.  Add the vanilla and beat until just incorporated.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake until the cake has risen, is golden brown on top, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Remove the cake from the oven and let it rest in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.

To serve, slice the pound cake and place in dessert bowls.  Scoop vanilla ice cream onto the cake and spoon the Sauteed Bananas and Ginger Syrup over each serving.

Sauteed Bananas and Ginger Syrup:  In a medium saucepan, combine the wine, water, sugar, and ginger, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the butter in a saute pan and melt.  Add the bananas, cut-sides down, add the five-spice and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Transfer to a bowl.  Pour the hot syrup onto the bananas and gently toss.  Let stand at least 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Scotch whisky
  2                     oranges -- cut into eighths
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     pheasants - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             slices  bacon -- halved
                        === WHISKY-CUMBERLAND SAUCE ===
  1                cup  Scotch whisky
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  grated orange zest
  1                cup  red currant jelly
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Wild rice

For the Pheasant:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, toss the oranges with 3 tablespoons of the whisky.  Rub the pheasants with the remaining 1 tablespoon of whisky and lightly season with salt and pepper.  Stuff each pheasant with the oranges and 1 sprig of fresh thyme, and close the cavities with skewers.  Wrap the breast of each pheasant with the bacon and set in a roasting pan.  Roast the pheasants until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let stand 10 minutes.

For the Whisky Cumberland Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, combine the whisky, orange juice, and orange zest, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced by 50 percent in volume to about 3/4 cup.  Add the currant jelly, salt, and cayenne, and stir well.

Cook until thickened, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and pour into a decorative bowl.  Cool slightly before serving.

Remove the bacon from the pheasant breasts, if desired, and cut each bird in half.  Discard the oranges and thyme in the cavity.  Serve hot with Whisky-Cumberland Sauce and wild rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 30    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SYRUP ===
  1 1/2           cups  Australian Leatherwood honey
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2                     lemons
                        === FILLING AND DOUGH ===
  1 1/2         pounds  mixed shelled pecans,
                        cashews, and pistachios
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  fine salt
  1 3/4           cups  unsalted butter - (3 1/2 sticks)
  18                    sheets phyllo dough - (abt 1 lb) -- thawed

To make the Syrup:  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the honey, water, sugar, and cinnamon stick.  Use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest of the lemons in large pieces and add to the syrup mixture.  Squeeze the lemons, discard the seeds, and add the juice to the syrup.

Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 35 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.  Remove and discard the cinnamon and lemon zest.

To make the Filling:  In a food processor, combine the nuts, cinnamon, allspice, and salt; pulse until finely chopped (don't over chop!).  Transfer the nut mixture to a bowl and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, completely melt the butter over medium heat.  Set aside for 5 minutes, then skim the white foam from the surface of the butter and discard.  Pour the clear butter into a small bowl, stopping before the watery liquid on the bottom pours in.  Discard the watery butter in the bottom of the pan.  Stir 1/2 cup of the syrup into the nut mixture.  Set the remaining syrup aside.

To assemble the baklava:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place a piece of parchment paper in a 10 by 14-inch baking dish.  (The edges of the parchment should come half way up the sides of the dish.)

Unroll the phyllo onto the work surface, and place the stack off to one side.  Lift 1 sheet and lay it on the workspace, lengthwise, and parallel to the edge of the counter.  Brush the sheet with some of the butter.  Lay another sheet on top, and brush with butter; repeat with 1 more sheet.  Mound 1/6 of the nut mixture, lengthwise, about 1-inch from the bottom edge and ends.  Roll the bottom edge of phyllo over the nut mixture, fold in the sides to seal the log, and continue rolling until completely closed.  Place the phyllo roll seam-side down in the baking dish.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 6 rolls in all, arranging them in snug rows.

Brush the top of the rolls lightly with water.  Using a paring knife, lightly score the rolls, crosswise, at 3-inch intervals.  Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Rewarm the syrup over medium heat.  Cut through the scored lines of the pastry and pour the syrup over the warm pastry.  Set aside to cool for 1 hour.

This recipe yields about 30 servings.

Stir 1/2 cup of the syrup into the nut mixture.  Set the remaining syrup aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the baklava:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a piece of parchment paper in a 10 by 14-inch baking dish.  (The edges of the parchment should come half way up the sides of the dish.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unroll the phyllo onto the work surface, and place the stack off to one side.  Lift 1 sheet and lay it on the workspace, lengthwise, and parallel to the edge of the counter.  Brush the sheet with some of the butter.  Lay another sheet on top, and brush with butter; repeat with 1 more sheet.  Mound 1/6 of the nut mixture, lengthwise, about 1-inch from the bottom edge and ends.  Roll the bottom edge of phyllo over the nut mixture, fold in the sides to seal the log, and continue rolling until completely closed.  Place the phyllo roll seam-side down in the baking dish.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 6 rolls in all, arranging them in snug rows.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the top of the rolls lightly with water.  Using a paring knife, lightly score the rolls, crosswise, at 3-inch intervals.  Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rewarm the syrup over medium heat.  Cut through the scored lines of the pastry and pour the syrup over the warm pastry.  Set aside to cool for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 30 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter -- sliced thinly
  1              pound  rutabagas -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/8" thick
  1              pound  Rome or Winesap apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced 1/8" thick
  1              pound  turnips -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/8" thick
  1              large  yellow onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1              pound  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/8" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  grated Fontina
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Butter a 13- by 9-inch casserole dish with 1 teaspoon of the butter.

Starting with the rutabagas, layer 1/3 of the vegetables, apples and onions in the prepared dish, very lightly seasoning with salt and pepper and dotting with butter between each.  Top with a layer of Fontina.  Repeat the layering, seasoning, and cheese, ending with cheese on top.

In a saucepan, bring the cream, chicken stock, and thyme to a boil.  Remove from the heat and pour over the vegetables.  Bake in the oven, covered, for 30 minutes.  Uncover and continue baking until nearly all the cream is absorbed, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan and bake until golden, all the liquid is absorbed, and the vegetables are fork tender, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

           Salmon With Beurre Rouge And Red Wine Braised Endive

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  skin-on salmon fillet
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Emeril's Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        = (preferably California Zinfandel)
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  minced shallots
  3                     fresh tarragon sprigs -- plus
  4                     tarragon sprigs -- for garnish
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  6             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
                        Red Wine Braised Endive -- (see recipe)

Preheat the grill.

Lightly oil the salmon and season with Essence, salt, and pepper.  Place on the grill, skin-side down, and cook to desired temperature.

Combine the wine, vinegar, shallots, 3 sprigs of tarragon, and peppercorns in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup in volume, about 15 minutes.  Strain into a clean medium saucepan.

Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Remove the salmon from the grill and cut the salmon into 4 pieces.  Place one fillet on each of 4 serving plates, top with the beurre rouge, and garnish each with a sprig of tarragon.  Serve with Red Wine Braised Endive.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  linguine pasta
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8             ounces  hot sausage -- removed from casing,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  red bell pepper in thin 1" strips
     1/2           cup  yellow bell pepper in thin 1" strips
     1/2           cup  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions -- plus extra
                        for garnish
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2         pounds  small raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes for dry pasta.  Drain in a colander.  Return to the pot and toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Cover and keep warm while finishing the recipe.

While the pasta is cooking, in a large saute pan, cook the sausage over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Pour off the fat from the pan.

Heat the oil in the pan over medium-high heat.  Add the bell peppers and shallots and cook, stirring, until just soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, green onions, and 1 tablespoon of the Essence, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Deglaze with white wine and cook until almost completely reduced.

Add the shrimp and sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons of the Essence.  Cook, stirring, until the shrimp are just pink, about 1 minute.  Add the lemon juice and cream and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring until starting to thicken, about 1 minute.

Add the cooked pasta, cheese, and parsley, and toss to combine.  Cook until the pasta is heated through and well coated, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Divide among 4 pasta bowls, garnish with additional chopped green onions, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  crawfish tails
  1              pound  deveined peeled shrimp
     1/3           cup  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  brandy
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3               cups  cooked medium-grain rice
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
                        Casings abt 1 1/2" dia and 4 feet long
     1/4      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                     yellow onion -- quartered
  4                     lemon slices
  1                     bay leaf
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        Mustard Cream Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a food processor, combine the crawfish, shrimp, shallots, cream, brandy, salt, cayenne, and pepper.  Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the rice and parsley.

Using the feeding tube on a mixer, stuff the seafood mixture into the casings to make 3-inch links.  Bring a large saucepan of salted water up to a boil.  Add the peppercorns, onion, lemon slices and bay leaf and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the sausage and poach until firm to the touch and plump, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the water and let cool.  In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Pan-fry the sausage for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.

To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of each plate, and top with sausages.  Serve immediately with Mustard Cream Sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  8        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  5            bunches  fresh watercress -- coarse stems
                        removed, well rinsed, with a little
                        water clinging to leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  20                    sea scallops -- patted dry
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  Brut Champagne -- see * Note
                        === PARMESAN CRISPS ===
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- defrosted
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1                cup  grated Parmesan
  4          teaspoons  sesame seeds

* Note:  Cook and Pair with Charbaut Brut Champagne, Epernay, France

In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the watercress, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pinch white pepper, and cook, stirring, until the watercress is wilted and tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Lightly season both sides of the scallops with salt and white pepper.  Heat the oil in a large skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the scallops and cook until golden and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.

Add the shallots to the oil remaining in the pan, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 1 minute.  Add the Champagne and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits clinging to the bottom of the pan, and cook until reduced by 50 percent in volume.  Add the remaining butter, 1 piece at a time, taking the skillet from the heat as necessary to prevent the sauce from breaking, and cook, whisking constantly, until all the butter is incorporated.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Divide the wilted watercress among 4 serving plates, top each with 5 sauteed scallops, and drizzle with the Champagne Butter Sauce.  Serve immediately with the Parmesan Crisps.

Parmesan Crisps:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside.

Unfold the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.  Using a pastry brush, brush the dough with the beaten egg.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan and sesame seeds, then roll with a rolling pin to make the cheese and seeds adhere to the pastry.  Cut the pastry in half horizontally, then into desired shapes, such as diamonds or rectangles.  Transfer to the prepared pan and bake until golden and risen, about 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        = (or Japanese udon noodles)
  2        tablespoons  Chinese rice wine

  4               cups  canola oil -- for frying
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  10                    shiitake caps -- finely sliced
  1                cup  finely-sliced carrots
     1/2         pound  Napa cabbage -- shredded
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  rice wine

  1              whole  sea bass or yellow fish - (2 lbs) -- scaled, and
                        eviscerated
     1/2           cup  Shaoxing cooking wine
                        = (Chinese rice wine)
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2               cups  rice flour
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs
                        === FOR THE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1                     star anise
  1             medium  yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  julienned carrots
  1                     red bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and julienned
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (homemade or low-sodium canned)
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1                cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  chili sauce
  2               cups  diced (1/2") fresh pineapple
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  sliced green onions, white and green

To make the Fish:  Score each side of the fish with 3 diagonal cuts.  Put the fish in shallow dish and pour over the rice wine.  Using your hands, rub the ginger all over the fish, pressing some of it into the cuts.  Set aside for 10 minutes, turning once.

Meanwhile, fill a fryer with oil and preheat to 370 degrees.

Put the flour in a dish and season the flour with salt and pepper, to taste.  Whisk together the eggs in a shallow bowl.  Remove the fish from the wine and dredge both sides in the rice flour, shaking off any excess.  Dip both sides of the fish in the egg and dredge again in the flour.

Holding the fish by the tail, gently lower the fish into the hot oil and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and transfer to a large serving platter.  Set aside in a warm spot while you make the sauce.

To make the Sauce:  Heat the oil in a large wok over high heat.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 1 minute.  Add the ginger and star anise and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until somewhat soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the carrots and pepper and cook, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes more.  Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Add the brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, chili sauce, and pineapple and stir to combine.  Return the sauce to a boil.

Meanwhile, whisk together the cornstarch and water in a small bowl.

Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce and return to a boil while whisking.  Boil until thickened.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove from the heat and stir in the green onions.  Pour the sauce over fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  10            ounces  salmon fillet -- skin removed,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
  1           teaspoon  chopped dill
  1           teaspoon  chopped tarragon
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  2              large  egg whites
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === TOMATO CREAM SAUCE ===
  1        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2 1/2           cups  chopped seeded tomatoes
  2             sprigs  thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  fish stock -- plus
  2        tablespoons  fish stock
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the shrimp, salmon, tarragon, shallots, egg whites, salt, and pepper and puree for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Be sure to scrape down the side of the bowl to ensure you end up with a smooth puree.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Remove the puree from the refrigerator and fold in 1 cup of the cream with a spatula or wooden spoon.  Using a whisk, beat the remaining heavy cream to medium peaks.  Fold the whipped cream into the fish mixture and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

To test the mousseline for seasoning and consistency, bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Drop a small ball (about 2 teaspoons) of the batter into the water, and poach until it rises to the surface.  As necessary, add more cream or seasoning.

Brush the insides of 12 (4-ounce) ramekins with the butter and divide the mousseline evenly among them.  Place the ramekins into deep roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover the ramekins with a piece of buttered parchment paper and bake until firm and puffed, 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove and turn each ramekin on its side, and carefully drain any excess cooking liquid.

Invert and unmold onto serving plates, turning them top-side up.  Spoon the Tomato Cream Sauce on top of and around the mousselines, and serve.

Tomato Cream Sauce:  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and cook until the tomatoes give up their liquid, about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.  Add the fish broth and tomato paste.  Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by 50 percent in volume.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by 50 percent in volume.

Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and parsley.  Remove the thyme sprigs.  With an immersion blender, puree the sauce.  Ladle the sauce on top of and around the mousselines on serving plates.  (Makes a generous 2 cups)

This recipe yields 12 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  peeled shrimp
     1/4           cup  minced green onions
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced jalapeÒo pepper
  1                     egg white
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4         pound  cream cheese -- cut into pieces
  14            slices  brioche or homemade-style white bread -- crusts removed
                        Vegetable oil or clarified butter -- for frying

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the shrimp, green onions, cilantro, garlic, jalapeÒo, egg white, salt, and process until smooth.  Add the cream cheese and pulse to incorporate.  Add the cream and pulse just until incorporated, being careful not to over-process.

Spread 2 heaping tablespoons of the shrimp mixture onto each slice of bread, spreading to the edges and smoothing the top.

In a large heavy pot, heat 4-inches of vegetable oil to 360 degrees.  Add the shrimp toasts in batches and fry until golden, coated-sides down first, about 1 minute per side.  Drain on paper towels, cut each slice in half diagonally, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 28 toasts.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  sweet sparkling wine -- see * Note
  2          envelopes  powdered unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  super-fine sugar
  1         tablespoon  strained fresh lemon juice
  2               cups  red raspberries
  2               cups  white raspberries
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

* Note:  Cook with Asti Spumante; Pair with Veauve Cliquot Demi-sec

Pour 1 cup of the wine into a small saucepan.  Sprinkle in the gelatin and let sit until the gelatin is soft, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Heat gently over medium heat, stirring very gently, until the gelatin is completely dissolved.  Add the sugar and lemon juice, and continue cooking, stirring very gently, until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.

Add the remaining wine, stirring just to combine.  Let stand 5 minutes, then skim any foam from the surface.  Refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until beginning to thicken, about 15 minutes.

Arrange about one-third to one-half of the berries across the bottom of a decorative 8-cup mold.  Pour in half of the gelatin mixture and refrigerate until just set, about 40 minutes to 1 hour.

Gently heat the remaining gelatin mixture to soften.  Add another layer of berries and top with the remaining gelatin.  Refrigerate until completely set, at least 6 hours or overnight.

To serve, place the bottom half of the mold in hot water for about 20 seconds.  Invert a serving platter over the bottom of the mold, and holding the edges, flip the mold right-side up.  Shake gently to release the gelee onto the platter.  Garnish with mint leaves and the remaining berries.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                cup  soy sauce
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/3           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  sriracha
                        = (hot red pepper chili paste)
  2        tablespoons  white sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh gingerroot
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  12                    skin-on chicken thighs - (abt 3 1/2 lbs)

Arrange the chicken on a platter, and spoon the reduced marinade on top.  Serve with the Honeyed Apple-Cabbage Slaw.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === EMERIL'S HOMEMADE BAY SEASONING ===
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  2                     finely ground bay leaves
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander seed
                        === STEAMED CRABS ===
  1                can  beer - (12 oz)
  1                cup  white vinegar
  24                    live blue crabs -- rinsed well in
                        several changes of fresh cold water
  2                     lemons -- quartered
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Hot crusty French bread -- for serving
                        === HOT BOILED CORN ON THE COB ===
  6               ears  fresh corn -- shucked
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Bay seasoning -- (optional)

For the Bay Seasoning:  In a large bowl, combine chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, bay leaves, oregano, salt, sugar, dry mustard, thyme, black pepper, white pepper, and coriander seed and set aside.

For the Crabs:  Inside a large pot, place an expandable steamer basket on the bottom.  Add the beer, vinegar, and enough water to come up to the bottom of the basket.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Carefully transfer the crabs with tongs to the basket, spritz with fresh lemon juice, and toss in the lemons.  Sprinkle bay seasoning, to taste, over each layer of crabs (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup).

Cover the pot tightly and steam until the crabs are cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.  (To check doneness, remove a crab leg, break open, and taste.)

Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper sauce.  Remove from the heat, adjust seasoning to taste, and serve as a dipping sauce for the crabs, bread, and corn.

Hot Boiled Corn on the Cob:  In a pot of boiling water, add salt and corn and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and carefully remove the corn with tongs to a serving platter.  If desired, sprinkle with additional bay seasoning.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

For the Bay Seasoning:  In a large bowl, combine chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, bay leaves, oregano, salt, sugar, dry mustard, thyme, black pepper, white pepper, and coriander seed and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Crabs:  Inside a large pot, place an expandable steamer basket on the bottom.  Add the beer, vinegar, and enough water to come up to the bottom of the basket.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Carefully transfer the crabs with tongs to the basket, spritz with fresh lemon juice, and toss in the lemons.  Sprinkle bay seasoning, to taste, over each layer of crabs (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover the pot tightly and steam until the crabs are cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.  (To check doneness, remove a crab leg, break open, and taste.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper sauce.  Remove from the heat, adjust seasoning to taste, and serve as a dipping sauce for the crabs, bread, and corn.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Hot Boiled Corn on the Cob:  In a pot of boiling water, add salt and corn and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and carefully remove the corn with tongs to a serving platter.  If desired, sprinkle with additional bay seasoning.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     plain angel food cake -- baked, cooled
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
  1                can  condensed milk - (12 oz)
     1/3           cup  lemon juice
  4          teaspoons  almond liqueur -- divided
                        = (or 1 tspn almond extract, divided)
  2 1/2           cups  sliced fresh strawberries
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1              Whole  strawberries -- stemmed, as garnish

Using a serrated cake or bread knife, carefully cut the top 1-inch from the cake.  Carefully remove and set aside.  Using the tip of the knife, cut into the cake along the inner and outer edges, leaving a 1-inch border of cake intact.  Using your fingers, carefully hollow out the cake between the two cuts, leaving an empty "tunnel".  Tear the removed cake into bite-size pieces and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Add the condensed milk and beat until thoroughly combined.  Stir in lemon juice and 2 teaspoons of the liqueur.  Gently fold in the cake pieces and strawberries.  Spoon the mixture into the tunnel in the center of the hollowed out cake, and cover with the reserved cake top.  Cover cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.

When ready to serve the cake, whip the cream until it begins to form peaks Add the confectioners' sugar and remaining 2 teaspoons of liqueur.  Whip until the cream forms stiff peaks but is not dry.  Frost the cake with the whipped cream and decorate with reserved whole strawberries.  Refrigerate for up to 1 hour, or serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork loin or butt - (5 to 7 lbs)
  1              whole  garlic head -- cloves separated,
                        and peeled
                        Emeril's red hot sauce
                        = (or other hot sauce)
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
     1/2        medium  green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2        tablespoons  teriyaki sauce
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === FOR THE GRAVY ===
  6        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  flour
  1             medium  yellow onion -- finely chopped
     1/2        medium  green bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  1                     rib celery -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2         bunch  green onions -- green and white
  1                     parts chopped separately
  2               cups  rich beef stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1              pound  button or cremini mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  teriyaki sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Pierce the roast all over with the tip of a paring knife and stuff one clove of garlic into each hole, followed by a few drops of hot sauce.  Sprinkle on all sides with Essence and garlic powder and rub into the meat.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat and brown the roast evenly on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the chopped onion, celery, bell pepper, and enough water to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan.  Add the teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and stir to combine and loosen any browned bits on the bottom of the pan.  Cover and bake for 45 minutes.

Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and add more water as necessary to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan.  Continue to cook until very tender, about 3 1/2 hours total cooking time.

Meanwhile, to make the gravy, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan.  Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat, until milk-chocolate-colored roux is formed, about 15 minutes.  Add the onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, and the white part of the green onions, and cook until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in the beef stock and heavy cream and cook until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.

While the sauce is simmering, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until tender and golden brown around the edges, about 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and teriyaki sauce to the gravy and simmer until flavors come together, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Remove the roast from the oven and transfer to a platter.  Cover loosely with foil to keep warm.  Strain the pan juices through a fine mesh strainer into the gravy and simmer until heated through and thickened, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve over the carved roast.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- plus
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2               cups  mashed cooked sweet potatoes
                        = (abt 2 lbs raw sweet potatoes)
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                cup  chopped toasted walnuts
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  confectioners' sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice -- or slightly
                        more as needed
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a 12-cup bundt pan with 1 teaspoon of the butter and set aside.

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, cream the butter, brown sugar, and sugar.  Add the sweet potatoes and beat until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs one at a time, and beat after each addition.

Into a bowl, sift together the flour, soda, powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg.  Add to the sweet potato mixture a third at a time.  Fold in the nuts and vanilla.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.

While the cake is resting in the pan, in a bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and orange zest.  Stir well to combine and make a tight glaze, adding more orange juice 1/2 teaspoon at a time to achieve a pourable consistency.

Turn out onto a wire rack.  While the cake is still warm, drizzle the orange-sugar glaze to evenly coat.  Cool completely before cutting.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     skeins mung bean noodles - (1 oz ea)
                        = (or cellophane noodles)
  8                     round rice paper wrappers - (8 1/2" dia)
  8              small  romaine lettuce leaves -- rinsed, patted dry,

  1              ounce  alfalfa or radish sprouts
  32                    cooked medium shrimp halves
  32                    fresh mint leaves
  32            sprigs  fresh cilantro
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, shredded
                        === HOT MUSTARD SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  dry Chinese hot mustard
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1              pinch  salt

Put 2 cups hot water in a large bowl and add the noodles.  Soak them until softened but slightly resilient, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain them and pat dry on paper towels.  Put in a bowl and cover.

Fill a large bowl with hot water.  Place a clean kitchen towel next to the bowl.  Submerge 1 rice paper wrapper in the water and soak it until softened, about 1 minute.  Carefully remove the rice paper from the water and lay it flat on the towel.  In the center of the sheet, layer 4 lettuce pieces, about 20 sprouts, 4 shrimp halves, arranged side by side in a row, 4 mint leaves, 4 cilantro sprigs, and one-eighth of the carrots.  Pull the bottom up over the filling, fold over the sides, and roll up like an egg roll.  Place seam-side down on a plate and repeat the process with the remaining rice papers and filling.  Serve immediately, with the Hot Mustard Sauce.

Hot Mustard Sauce:  Put the mustard in a small bowl and slowly drizzle in the water, whisking to make a thin paste.  Add the vinegar and salt and whisk well to blend.  Set aside until needed.  The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one week.  Stir well before serving.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 8 summer rolls; 4 to 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON SPONGE CAKE ===
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1                     lemon -- zested
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
                        === LEMON CURD ===
  6                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
                        === CITRON SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  lemon-flavored vodka
                        === MERINGUE ICING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     1/3           cup  cold water
  3                     egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  hot water

Lemon Sponge Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease and line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and set aside.

In a bowl fitted with an electric mixer, whip the egg yolks, 1/3 cup of the sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla on medium-high speed until thick and almost doubled in volume.  (The yolks will form slowly dissolving ribbons when the whip is lifted out.)

In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites on medium speed until frothy.  Gradually add the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar, and whip on high speed until stiff peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, being careful not to over mix.  Sift half of the flour and cornstarch into the egg mixture, and gently fold to incorporate.  Repeat with the remaining flour and cornstarch.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20 minutes.

Turn the cake 180 degrees, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean and the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

Lemon Curd:  In the top of a double boiler, or in a stainless steel bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar, and lemon juice.  Place over simmering water and whisk until thickened.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until all incorporated.

Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until cool, about 3 hours or overnight.

Citron Syrup:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and vodka.  Gently heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves.

To assemble the cake:  Slice the cake into 3 layers horizontally.  Place the top layer of cake in the bottom of the springform pan and brush with 1/3 of the citron syrup.  Spread 1 cup of lemon curd on top and smooth evenly.  Repeat with the remaining 2 cakes layers, citron syrup and lemon curd.  Refrigerate while making the Meringue Icing.

In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and cold water.  Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Boil, uncovered, until the syrup reaches the soft ball stage (240 degrees) on a candy thermometer.  Remove from the heat.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt with an electric mixer until frothy.  With the machine running, slowly pour the syrup down the sides of the bowl into the whites (being careful not to pour the syrup into the moving wire whisk).  When all the syrup has been added, add the vanilla and continue beating until the mixture has cooled and is fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Add the lemon juice and water, and set aside.

Remove the cake from the refrigerator and unwrap.  Remove the sides of the pan and spread the icing in a thin layer over the sides and top of the cake.  Put the remaining icing in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and decoratively pipe rosettes on top of the cake.

Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Prior to serving, with a blowtorch, brown the meringue lightly.

Propane Gas Torch Warning:  Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat or flame, and should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight.  Propane gas torches should only be used in well-ventilated areas.  When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you.  Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve.  Light the gas jet, and blow out the match.  Always turn off the burner valve to "finger tight" when finished using the torch.  Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Gradually whisk in all the oil, and continue mixing until an emulsion forms.  Add the salt and pepper and mix well.  Toss the dressing as desired on the salad.  Crumble the cheese on top and serve.

Pair with the same Merlot as in the dressing.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  15       tablespoons  flour - (a scant cup)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
  1 1/4           cups  milk
     1/4           cup  lard

In a bowl sift flour and salt together.  Make a well in the center and add the egg and 1/4 cup of milk and beat together, gradually incorporating the flour and adding the milk as necessary to form a smooth batter but being careful not to over-beat.  (Batter should be the thickness of heavy cream.)  Allow batter to rest for at least half an hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Place a teaspoon of lard in each well of a 12 cup muffin tin or into individual Yorkshire pudding tins, and heat in the oven until very hot, about 5 minutes.  Divide batter between wells and bake until risen, puffed and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 Yorkshire Puddings, serving 6.

                     Zucchini And Yellow Squash Tian

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  zucchini -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/4" thick slices
  1 1/2         pounds  yellow squash -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/4" thick slices
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  yellow onions -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
  1                     roasted red bell pepper -- peeled, stemmed,
                        seeds removed, cut into 1/8" strips
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan

Lay the zucchini and squash slices in a flat layer on kitchen towels.  Lightly salt on both sides and let sit until most of the liquid has been released, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, thyme, salt, crushed red pepper, and ground black pepper, and saute until the onions are softened and caramelized, about 15 minutes

In a small bowl combine the extra virgin olive oil, basil, and garlic, and steep 15 minutes.

In a large bowl, toss the zucchini and squash with the flour to lightly coat.

Rub 1 tablespoon of the basil oil on the bottom of a baking sheet.  Spread the onions in a layer on the bottom of the baking sheet.  Arrange a row of zucchini lengthwise on top of the onions, overlapping the edges slightly.  Lay a thin row of red peppers next to the zucchini, then a row of squash.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Evenly drizzle the remaining basil oil over the vegetables.  Top with an even coating of breadcrumbs, then cheese.

Bake until light golden brown on top, about 40 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
