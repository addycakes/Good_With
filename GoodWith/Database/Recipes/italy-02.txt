Recipe By     :David Ruggerio
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Italian
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  smoked ham - (abt 12 to 18 lbs)
                        Whole cloves -- as needed
  3               cups  pineapple juice
  1              pound  dark brown sugar
  1             bottle  dark corn syrup - (16 oz)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Place the ham in a shallow roasting pan.  Score the fat and stud it completely with cloves.  Pour the pineapple juice over the ham and bake for 12 minutes per pound.

After 1 1/2 hours, remove the ham from the oven and carefully pat the brown sugar on top, completely covering the top of the ham.  Gently pour the corn syrup over the ham, being careful not to disturb the sugar covering.  Continue baking, basting every 15 minutes.

When the ham has baked its allotted time, remove it from oven and continue basting until it is cooled -- this gives it a beautiful glaze.  The remaining syrup can be used again over a side dish such as yams, butternut squash, or sweet potatoes if you are serving the ham hot as a main dish.  Otherwise, it can be left on the sideboard or kitchen counter at room temperature during the day for snacking purposes, then stored in the refrigerator for several days.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 main dish, lunch, or snack servings.

Comments:  Here is one of the most famous ham recipes anywhere, from Anna Amandolara Nurse, a truly lovely lady, generous and kind, and one of the greatest cooking teachers of all time.

You might not think of this as a particularly Italian-American recipe, but it is -- maybe with an emphasis on the American.  As Anna says, even at a traditional Italian-American Christmas this ham is always on the sideboard: "It may not be the main feature, but it's always an extra added attraction."  When you put away all the perishable foods, the pies stay out and the ham stays out, ready for snacking at any time.

This ham has been the centerpiece of the James Beard Foundation fundraiser brunches that Anna has run for the last ten years.  This recipe has also appeared in print many times, and there's a reason for that: It's the best!  Anna uses Lundy smoked country hams from North Carolina because she likes their consistency -- they're never too salty, never too fatty.

                   Asparagus Soup - {Zuppa Di Asparagi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  asparagus
  2               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  3              large  shallots -- diced
     1/4           cup  light cream
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt

Cut off the tough ends of the asparagus and discard.  Place the asparagus in a saute pan with the water.  Cover the pot, bring the asparagus to a gentle boil, and cook for 3 or 4 minutes (depending on size), just until a knife easily pierces the stem end.

Drain the asparagus in a colander over a bowl, reserving the cooking water.  When cool, cut the asparagus into 1-inch pieces.  Dice some of the pieces to equal 1/2 cup and set aside.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and cook slowly until they begin to soften.  Add all the asparagus except the 1/2 cup, and continue to cook for about 4 minutes, or until the asparagus is very soft.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth.  Return the mixture to the saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups of the reserved cooking water, cream, and salt.  Cook slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon to blend the ingredients.  Add the reserved diced asparagus.  If the mixture appears too thick, add a bit more of the cooking water.  Serve immediately.

Note:  Sometimes I add diced prosciutto, sauteed in butter until crisp, as a garnish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In the spring, I seek out asparagus.  I look for solid, stately bundles wrapped with string, sitting in neat rows, perched atop crushed ice.  I buy the very thin asparagus because they remind me so much of the slender ones of Umbria.  When I get my bundle home, I make this quick and creamy soup, using the cooking water from the asparagus.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and cook slowly until they begin to soften.  Add all the asparagus except the 1/2 cup, and continue to cook for about 4 minutes, or until the asparagus is very soft.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth.  Return the mixture to the saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups of the reserved cooking water, cream, and salt.  Cook slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon to blend the ingredients.  Add the reserved diced asparagus.  If the mixture appears too thick, add a bit more of the cooking water.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Sometimes I add diced prosciutto, sauteed in butter until crisp, as a garnish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In the spring, I seek out asparagus.  I look for solid, stately bundles wrapped with string, sitting in neat rows, perched atop crushed ice.  I buy the very thin asparagus because they remind me so much of the slender ones of Umbria.  When I get my bundle home, I make this quick and creamy soup, using the cooking water from the asparagus.

Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried Great Northern or cannellini beans
     1/2           cup  dried red kidney or borlotti beans
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
  2             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed and
                        debearded
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt -- or more to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fennel leaves
                        = (or flat-leaf parsley)
  2               cups  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or 2 cups diced peeled tomatoes)
  2             medium  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled and cubed
  2               cups  cooked ditalini or elbow macaroni

Place the beans in a pot, cover with 5 cups of water, and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer over medium heat for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the beans are al dente.  Drain, reserving 2 cups of the cooking liquid.

Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet.  Add half the garlic and saute until it softens.  Add the parsley, mussels, wine, salt, and pepper.  Cover and simmer until the mussels open, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Scoop the mussels out of the pan with a slotted spoon and let them cool.  Strain the cooking liquid into a bowl.

When cool enough to handle, shell the mussels, discarding any that are cracked or did not open.  Add the mussels to the reserved cooking liquid, cover, and refrigerate.

Return the skillet to the stove and heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Add the remaining garlic, the onion, basil, and fennel leaves.  Saute until the onion is wilted.  Add the diced tomatoes or tomato sauce, stir well, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the beans, the reserved bean cooking liquid, and the potatoes and mix well.  Cover and simmer for 25 minutes.

Add the mussels and their reserved liquid and cook, covered, for 5 minutes.  Add the ditalini or elbow macaroni and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until heated through.  Serve immediately.

Note:  If you prefer a thinner soup, add additional bean water.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  A personal favorite for Christmas Eve is this mussel and pasta soup, thickened with two kinds of dried beans and potatoes.  The original recipe comes from my friend Maria Castaldo Esposito's mother, who lives in Scisciano, near Mount Vesuvius.

          Beef Stew In Dark Beer - {Spezzatino Alla Birra Scura}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless beef chuck -- cut into 1" pieces
  5        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        = (or lard)
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin slices
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                can  dark beer - (12 oz)

On a plate, mix the salt and pepper.  Add the meat pieces and toss to coat well.  Set aside.

In a heavy skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat.  Add the onion and bay leaf, and cook until the onion is wilted and very soft, but not brown.

Raise the heat to medium-high, add the beef pieces, and brown well.

In a small bowl, mix the tomato paste with the beer.  Let the foam subside, then add the mixture to the beef.  Stir well, bring to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer, cover the skillet, and cook until beef is tender, about 45 minutes.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The Egyptians are credited with inventing beer.  Papyri from around 1300 B.C. called for the regulation of beer shops to prevent the excesses of beer drinking.  Since that time, beer has been an ingredient in cooking as well.  One of the dishes that I recall from my childhood is a beef stew long simmered in beer, then served over polenta, potatoes, rice, or pasta.  It was even better served the next day.  I have reduced the original recipe considerably, but you can successfully double the ingredients.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE POLENTA ===
  1                cup  stone-ground cornmeal
  3               cups  cold water
                        === FOR THE SOUP ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 3/4         pounds  meaty beef shin, center cut with bone -- trimmed of any fat
  1             medium  yellow onion -- peeled and quartered
  2               cups  diced fresh plum tomatoes
  2                     celery stalks -- washed and quartered
  2              large  carrots -- scraped and
                        quartered
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  12                    whole cloves -- tied in a small
                        piece of cheesecloth
  1              large  bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                     large bunch basil
  10              cups  hot water

To make the polenta, pour the cornmeal into a 1 1/2-quart saucepan and stir in the water with a wooden spoon.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the cornmeal starts to thicken and leave the sides of the pan.  Cook for about 15 minutes, always stirring in one direction to keep the mixture smooth.

Pour the polenta out onto a cutting board, spread it evenly, and let cool.  Cut the polenta into 8 pieces, cover with a piece of wax paper, set aside, and keep warm.

In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil and brown the beef shin slowly on all sides.  Add the onion, tomatoes, celery, carrots, salt, pepper, cloves, bay leaf, oregano, basil, and the water.  Stir the ingredients with a wooden spoon and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer the soup, covered, for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours, or until the beef shin is tender when pierced with a knife.

With a slotted spoon remove the beef bones, carrots, and celery and place on a cutting board.  Remove the cloves and discard.  Pour the remaining liquid and ingredients through a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl.  Press on the solids to extract the juices, then discard the solids.  Pour the liquid into a large bowl and set aside.

Trim the meat from the bones and shred it into small pieces.  Add the meat to the liquid in the bowl.  Cut the carrots and celery into thin slices and add them to the bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

When ready to use, remove the plastic wrap; scoop off the fat that has congealed at the top of the bowl and discard it.  Pour the soup back into a soup pot and heat on low until hot.

Place a slice of polenta in each individual soup bowl.  Ladle the soup over the polenta and serve immediately.

Refrigerate the remaining soup for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

Tip:  You can make the polenta ahead of time.  Cool, cover, and refrigerate it.  When needed, cut it into pieces and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Heat for 5 to 7 minutes or until hot in a preheated 350 degrees oven.

This recipe yields 3 quarts.

Comments:  How do you make a good beef vegetable soup?  Use meaty bones such as neck bones, steak bones, or shin bones; they lend great flavor to the broth.  I like to use center-cut shin bone for this homey soup.  And I follow the same traditions handed down at home, with one exception: I like to add slices of cooked polenta just before serving.  Make the soup a day ahead and refrigerate it.  This makes it easy to remove the fat that has collected and congealed on the surface of the soup.

Refrigerate the remaining soup for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  You can make the polenta ahead of time.  Cool, cover, and refrigerate it.  When needed, cut it into pieces and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Heat for 5 to 7 minutes or until hot in a preheated 350 degrees oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 3 quarts.

Comments:  How do you make a good beef vegetable soup?  Use meaty bones such as neck bones, steak bones, or shin bones; they lend great flavor to the broth.  I like to use center-cut shin bone for this homey soup.  And I follow the same traditions handed down at home, with one exception: I like to add slices of cooked polenta just before serving.  Make the soup a day ahead and refrigerate it.  This makes it easy to remove the fat that has collected and congealed on the surface of the soup.

                     Black Cabbage Soup - {Ribollita}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried white beans
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     large sprig fresh rosemary
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1         tablespoon  diced fresh chili pepper
  4                     carrots -- diced
  2                     celery stalks -- diced
  2                     potatoes -- peeled and diced
  1              small  zucchini -- diced
  1              pound  kale -- stemmed, washed,
                        and torn into pieces
  6                     plum tomatoes -- diced
  6               cups  hot water
     1/2         pound  green beans -- cut into thirds
  1         tablespoon  celery salt
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  8             slices  toasted bread

Put the beans in a bowl and cover them with 3 cups of cold water.  Allow them to stand overnight.  The following day drain the beans and transfer them to a 2-quart pot.  Cover the beans with 6 cups of water and cook them for about 45 minutes or until tender.  Drain the beans.  Puree half of them and set all the beans aside.

Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot.  Add the rosemary, onion, chili pepper, carrots, and celery.  Cook over medium heat until the vegetables begin to soften.  Stir in the potatoes, zucchini, kale, and tomatoes.  Cook 2 minutes.  Stir in the whole beans.

Pour in the water and the pureed beans and stir all the ingredients well.  Add the cheese rind if you have one.  Cover the pot, reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 25 minutes.  Uncover the pot, stir in the green beans and cook 5 more minutes.

Stir in the celery salt, salt, and pepper.  Taste for seasoning.

Toast the bread slices then place one in each of 8 soup bowls.  Ladle the soup over the bread and serve.  Pass additional olive oil to drizzle on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Robillita is a classic Tuscan soup.  The word means to reboil as in make this soup one day and reheat it the next.  The key ingredients are fresh or dried cannellini beans and cavolo nero or black cabbage with sturdy dark green elongated leaves.  Use kale in place of cavolo nero.  This hearty soup is usually served over slices of thick toasted bread.  Begin the process by soaking the dried beans overnight.  I like to add the salt and pepper after the soup is cooked.  I also like to add Parmesan cheese rinds to the soup as it cooks, but this is optional.

                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIE BATTER ===
  2              large  egg whites -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  confectioner's sugar
     1/4           cup  fine semolina flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  fine semolina flour
     2/3           cup  coarsely-hopped semisweet or
                        milk chocolate
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped blanched almonds
                        === FROSTING ===
     2/3           cup  coarsely-chopped semisweet chocolate
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Generously grease and flour your cookie sheets, or line with parchment paper.

In a glass or copper bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks begin to form.  Slowly add half the sugar a little at a time, beating until well incorporated and the whites are stiff and shiny.  With a spatula, sprinkle the remaining sugar, semolina flour, chocolate, and almonds over the egg whites and fold in with a rubber spatula.

Using 2 teaspoons, use a small portion of batter to form bone-shaped cookies about 3 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.  (I use a cardboard template of a bone and trace it with a pencil onto the underside of the parchment paper, then fill in the space with the batter.)  Space the cookies about 1 inch apart.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the cookies are fairly dry but still pale looking.  Cool on sheets, then transfer carefully to a cooling rack.

Fill the bottom of a double boiler with water and bring to a boil.  Turn off the heat, add the chocolate and butter to the top of the double boiler, cover, and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes or until the chocolate and butter are melted.

Stir the frosting well.  Dip the underside of each cookie into the frosting and, while still wet, make wavy lines through the chocolate with a fork or a frosting comb.  Let the cookies dry completely.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  These cookies are brittle and dry like old bones.  They are made all over Italy around November 1 and 2 to celebrate All Souls' Day, in remembrance of deceased relatives.  Don't let their name turn you off.  They are unusual to look at, delicious to eat, and a real conversation piece.

                 Broiled Sandwiches - {Panini Arrostiti}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  Italian bread, cut 3/4" thk
                        = (from a 9" round)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              small  zucchini -- cut lengthwise into
                        thin strips
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- thinly sliced
  2                     plum tomatoes -- cut in thin rounds
     1/2         pound  sliced mozzarella or Fontina cheese*
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Use fresh mozzarella (fior di latte) if available.  Its mild and delicate taste is unbeatable.  A combination of mozzarella and Fontina works well, too.

Place the bread in a single layer in a broiling pan and drizzle each slice with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Top each slice with the remaining ingredients in the order given.  Sprinkle with a little black pepper.

Broil the sandwiches about 6 inches from the heat until the cheese has bubbled and is nicely browned.  Serve the sandwiches immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The success of this quick but appealing sandwich depends upon the ingredients being cut almost paper thin and uniform in size. These are a snap to put together, wonderful for a luncheon accompanied by a green salad and fresh fruit. Or team them with Zuppa di Fagioli for a fall or winter supper. These sandwiches can also be made cocktail size for a more formal affair.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried cranberry or Great Northern beans
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     chicken bouillon cubes -- crumbled
  1              pound  cabbage -- washed, halved,
                        core removed, leaves cut into 1/4" strips
  1             medium  carrot -- shaved into strips
                        with a vegetable peeler
     1/2         pound  onions -- peeled and diced
     1/2         pound  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled and diced
  7               cups  hot water
  4             ounces  cheese rinds -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  minced Italian parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to drizzle over soup

The night before making the soup, soak the beans in 2 cups of water.  The following day, drain and rinse the beans, put them in a pot and cover them with 3 cups of water.  Cook the beans for 20 minutes, then drain them and set them aside.

In a soup pot, heat the olive oil, stir in the crumbled bouillon cubes, cabbage, carrot, and onion.  Cover the pot and cook the vegetables over medium heat for 20 minutes.  Uncover the pot, stir in the beans, potatoes, water, and cheese rinds (if using), and cook, covered, over low heat for 45 minutes, or until the beans are tender, hold their shape, and are not mushy.  Stir in the parsley, salt, and black pepper.

Remove the cheese rinds with a spoon and with a small knife scrape off the cheese and return it to the pot.  Discard the rinds.

Serve the soup hot in soup bowls with a drizzle of olive oil over the top.

Variation:  Place toasted slices of Italian bread in the base of individual soup bowls and ladle the soup over the bread.

Did you know that one of the best things to buy in Italian grocery stores are bouillon cubes?  They are made by Knorr but are much larger than the bouillon cubes available here, and they have a more concentrated flavor.  I always make a habit of buying a few boxes to bring home.

This recipe yields 3 quarts.

Comments:  While visiting Prato I stopped to have lunch at Osteria La Farnacia dei Sani.  The rustic walls of this tavern, which is also an enoteca (wine shop), are lined with bottles of regional wine.  The patrons dine faccia a faccia (face to face) at long wooden tables seated on rock-hard benches.  There is no menu; the waiters just rattle off the kitchen's offerings like drill sergeants.  My choice, zuppa di verza, patate e fagioli (cabbage soup with potatoes and beans), was served in deep bowls accompanied by hunks of Tuscan bread and a flask of extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling on the soup.  One of my favorite techniques for flavoring this soup is to crumble chicken bouillon cubes over the sauteing vegetables instead of dissolving the cubes in liquid first.  I also like to add the cheese rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Start the process the night before by soaking the beans in water.  The recipe makes a lot and the soup can be frozen for future use.

                     Capon Broth - {Brodo Di Cappone}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     capon - (abt 5 lbs) -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        studded with
  8                     whole cloves
  1                     bay leaf
  2              large  parsley sprigs -- tied together with
  2              large  basil sprigs -- with kitchen string
                        Juice of 1 large lemon
  2              large  celery ribs with leaves -- cut into quarters
  3                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
  3                     plum tomatoes -- skinned, seeded,
                        and cut into pieces

Put all the ingredients in a large stockpot and cover with cold water.  Bring the ingredients to a boil, lower the heat and simmer covered for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender.  During the cooking, use a skimmer to skim off the foam that collects at the top and discard it.

With a slotted spoon, remove the capon pieces to a bowl.  Pour the rest of the soup and ingredients into a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a large bowl.  Press on all the solids with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all the juices.  Discard the solids.

Cover and refrigerate the broth overnight, then skim any fat off the top before reheating.  The broth can also be frozen for several months.

This recipe yields 4 quarts.

Comments:  Brodo di Cappone, (capon broth), is rich and full-bodied, just the kind of broth needed to compliment homemade cappelletti.  A capon is a rooster that has been castrated, and slaughtered before it is 1 year old.  The meat is very flavorful with a good deal more white meat than turkey.  Capons can be ordered in your grocery store or they can be found in the frozen meat section.  Or make the broth with a stewing chicken.  Capon can also be used as the filling for cappelletti if you do not wish to use a combination of meats.  I also serve the cooked capon with a sweet and sour (agrodolce) sauce.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  6        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  6               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  cubed Asiago cheese - (abt 2 oz)
     1/2           cup  cubed Italian Fontina cheese - (abt 2 oz)
     1/2           cup  Provolone cheese - (abt 2 oz)
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        === CRESPELLE BATTER ===
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated nutmeg
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  milk - (to 1 3/4)
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

To make the filling, in a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.  Add the flour and stir to blend well.  Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly, and stir until smooth.  Raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring constantly, for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce just coats the back of the spoon.  Turn off the heat and add the cubed cheeses, Parmigiano, salt and pepper, and nutmeg.  Stir until smooth.  Cover to keep warm and set aside.

To make the batter, sift 1 3/4 cups flour, the salt, and nutmeg together into a large bowl.  Add the beaten eggs and egg yolk, 1 1/2 cups of the milk, and the butter.  Whisk the mixture until smooth and the consistency of pancake batter.  If the better seems too thin, add a little more flour; if too thick, add a little milk.

Lightly butter a 6- or 8-inch crepe pan or a frying pan (I use a Teflon-coated one).  Heat over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, add 1/4 cup of the batter and swirl the pan to make sure the bottom is evenly coated with a thin layer of batter.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned on the underside.  Flip the crespella over and cook the other side until lightly browned.  Remove the crespella to a sheet of wax paper.  Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the crespelle between wax paper as you make them.  Lightly grease the pan every so often to prevent the batter from sticking.

Pre heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9- by 12-inch baking dish.

Spread about 3 tablespoons of the filling over each crespella, making sure to cover the surface evenly.  Fold each crespella in half, then in half again, and place them in the buttered dish, slightly overlapping them.  Spoon the remaining filling over the crespelle and sprinkle with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

Bake for 20 minutes, or until piping hot.  Run the crespelle under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes to brown the top, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Crespelle means "folds", folded pancakes that is.  I first had them in Torgiano, where Chef Angelo of Tre Vaselle turns them out faster than lightning.  The crespelle, made from a crepe-like batter, are cooked in a frying pan.  The action is all in the wrist as you flip each crespella.  I serve these as a first course.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  3                     celery ribs -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1                     large sprig fresh rosemary
  3               cups  thinly-sliced zucchini
  8               cups  hot water
  2                     chicken bouillon cubes
  1              piece  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind
                        = (3" by 3", or more if you have it)
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a soup pot, heat the butter and olive oil until hot.  Add the onion, celery, parsley, and rosemary and cook over low heat until the vegetables soften.  Add the zucchini and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the water, bouillon cubes, and cheese rind and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and let simmer for 30 minutes.

Add the rice, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook until the rice is al dente, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Remove the cheese rind from the pot and, with a small knife, scrape off any remaining cheese.  Add it to the soup and discard the rind.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This soup gets its flavor from the rinds of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, an ingenious Italian habit I learned from Nonna Galasso.  When cheese ends can no longer be grated because they are too hard, toss them into the soup pot, where they soften and produce a wonderful, nourishing soup.  Save your Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese ends and use them in vegetable, meat, and bean soups.  Despite its simplicity, this first-course soup is well suited to any occasion.

                 Cherry Tomato, Leek And Rice Soup - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  leeks -- dark green tops
                        removed and discarded
     1/4           cup  water -- for cooking leeks
  2             pounds  whole cherry tomatoes -- stemmed and washed
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  long-grain rice
  1 1/4           cups  water -- for cooking rice

Cut the leeks in half lengthwise, wash them well to remove any dirt, and cut them into thin slices.  Put the leeks in a nonstick soup pot and add the water.  Cook the leeks, covered, over very low heat and stir them occasionally until they are very soft; this will take about 20 minutes.  Stir in the tomatoes and cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 30 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender (in batches if necessary) and whirl or blend until smooth.

Pour the soup into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl.  With a wooden spoon stir the soup and press on the solids to extract the juices.  When the remaining pulp in the strainer is solid and dry looking, discard it.

Transfer the soup to the soup pot.  Stir in salt to taste and set aside.

Meanwhile in a small saucepan combine the rice and the water and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to simmer, cover the pot, and cook the rice until it has absorbed all the water.  Transfer the rice to the soup and stir it in.  Reheat the soup until hot and then serve.

Variation:  Add fresh minced herbs such as parsley, basil, mint, or dill, or add diced mozzarella cheese to the soup just before serving.

Did you know that the ancient Romans revered leeks (porri) for their health benefits?  It is said that the emperor Nero, who loved to sing, ate them every day to improve the quality of his voice.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 quarts.

Comments:  Even though only a few ingredients are necessary for this soup, it is very important that the tomatoes be in season for the best flavor.  Many episodes of Ciao Italia have featured my Italian vegetable garden.  In those episodes I show how the vegetables grow, are harvested, and cooked.  In the case of cherry tomatoes, I plant a variety called Sweet 100, a prolific and sweet-as-sugar tomato that is excellent for this soup.  There is such a bumper crop that I can harvest the tomatoes, stem, wash, and dry them and pop them whole into heavy-duty zipper-lock plastic bags, freezing them for winter use.  There is no fat in this soup.  Make it in a nonstick soup pot for best results.

                      Chickpea Fritters - {Panelle}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  chickpea flour - (8 oz)
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3               cups  water
  3        tablespoons  finely-minced fresh parsley or oregano -- (optional)
  4               cups  vegetable oil - (to 6)

In a heavy saucepan or copper pot mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together off the heat.  Slowly stir in the water and blend in with a heavy-duty whisk, being careful to avoid lumps from forming.  Stir in the parsley or oregano, if using.

Cook the mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly until it thickens and begins to move away from the sides of the pan.  Remove the pan from the heat.

Using a rubber spatula, divide and spread the mixture thinly among four 9-inch plates, making sure to cover the plate completely to the rim.  Set the plates aside to cool for 2 or 3 minutes.  Run a butter knife around the outside of each plate.  Carefully pull the panelle away from the dish.  Stack the panelle on top of each other and cut them in half lengthwise, then into quarters.  Cut each quarter in half.  There should be 32 panelle.

In a deep fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the panelle until they are nicely browned.  Drain them on brown paper and serve immediately.

Variation:  Another way to form the panelle is to spread the cooked mixture out onto an oiled cookie sheet or cutting board.  Let the mixture cool and then cut into rectangles.  Or fill an empty tin can with the bottom removed with the mixture and let it cool.  Push the mixture out with your hand.  Cut the dough into rounds and fry.  These are best eaten hot.

Note:  To make ahead, form and cut the panelle and freeze them in single layers on a cookie sheet uncooked.  When they are frozen, remove the panelle to plastic bags and seal well.  Defrost as needed and fry.

Did you know that chickpeas are one of the world's oldest foods and considered a "poor food" by historians, who have dated their use to prehistoric times?  Chickpeas are packed with protein and can be served in a variety of ways, soups to marinated salads.

This recipe yields 32 fritters.

Comments:  Walking through the streets of the kinetic city of Palermo is an experience for all the senses.  Your eyes are drawn at once to a melting pot of architectural styles from Byzantine to Baroque.  Beautiful ornate fountains are everywhere, and the hordes of people and dizzying traffic make for fever-pitch activity.  Your nose tells you that something good is cooking just around the corner -- delicious street food sold from little carts.  But a panino (sandwich) stuffed with lamb intestines, or iris (bread filled with sheep's-milk ricotta cheese and chocolate), or my favorite, panelle, which are golden, fried fritters made from ground chickpea flour, water, and herbs.  On December 13, Sicilians celebrate the feast of St. Lucy, patron of eyesight, by eating panelle.  You will never be able to eat just one.  Panelle are easy to make and a great antipasto idea for a party.  See the mail order sources at the back of my cookbook for chickpea flour if you cannot find it in your area.

        Cibreo's Yellow Pepper Soup - {Passato Di Peperoni Gialli}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spinach -- washed and stemmed
  1         tablespoon  milk or heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1                     red onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     carrot -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     meaty yellow peppers - (abt 1 3/4lbs) -- seeded, and
                        cut into strips
  3             medium  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  6               cups  hot vegetable broth
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

Cook the spinach in a large soup pot with no additional water just until it is wilted.  Drain it and partially squeeze it dry.  Transfer the spinach to a food processor and puree it with the milk or heavy cream.  The puree should not be too thick, but more like the consistency of fruit sauce.  Stir in the nutmeg and keep the spinach warm.  This step can be done two days ahead and refrigerated.  Reheat it when ready to serve the soup.

Finely mince the carrot, onion, and celery together and cook them in the olive oil in a small saute pan until they are very soft.  Set aside.

Put the peppers and potatoes in the same pot used to the cook the spinach.  Cover them with the broth.  Cook covered until very soft, about 25 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a food processor in batches along with the carrot mixture and puree until smooth.  Transfer the mixture back to the soup pot and stir in the salt and lemon juice.  If the soup seems too thick, thin it down with a little milk.

When ready to serve, reheat the spinach sauce and spoon a thin layer of it in the base of individual soup bowls.  Carefully ladle the soup over the spinach and garnish with fried bread croutons if desired.  Or cut out some raw red pepper shapes with a canape cutter and float on top of the soup.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Cibreo is a fabulous restaurant in Florence and one where I have had some really scrumptious meals.  One of my favorite recipes from their kitchen is this colorful, pureed yellow pepper soup; it is all warmth and sunshine on a dreary winter's day.  I like to add a twist and surprise the diner with a thin layer of spinach puree in the bottom of the bowl!

Cook the spinach in a large soup pot with no additional water just until it is wilted.  Drain it and partially squeeze it dry.  Transfer the spinach to a food processor and puree it with the milk or heavy cream.  The puree should not be too thick, but more like the consistency of fruit sauce.  Stir in the nutmeg and keep the spinach warm.  This step can be done two days ahead and refrigerated.  Reheat it when ready to serve the soup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Finely mince the carrot, onion, and celery together and cook them in the olive oil in a small saute pan until they are very soft.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the peppers and potatoes in the same pot used to the cook the spinach.  Cover them with the broth.  Cook covered until very soft, about 25 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a food processor in batches along with the carrot mixture and puree until smooth.  Transfer the mixture back to the soup pot and stir in the salt and lemon juice.  If the soup seems too thick, thin it down with a little milk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, reheat the spinach sauce and spoon a thin layer of it in the base of individual soup bowls.  Carefully ladle the soup over the spinach and garnish with fried bread croutons if desired.  Or cut out some raw red pepper shapes with a canape cutter and float on top of the soup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                   Cold Rice Salad - {Insalata Di Riso}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Arborio or long-grain rice
  1                can  tuna packed in olive oil - (3 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  dried tomatoes packed in oil -- drained and diced
                        = (homemade or store-bought)
  1                     red bell pepper -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped pitted Kalamata olives
  1              small  sweet white or red onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fennel bulb
  3                     fresh basil leaves -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste (optional)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste (optional)
                        Sliced tomatoes -- for garnish
                        Fresh basil leaves -- for garnish

In a medium saucepan, bring 6 cups of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the rice and bring back to the boil.  Cover, lower the heat to medium, and cook the rice until al dente, about 20 minutes.  Drain the rice and let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the rice, tuna, dried tomatoes, red pepper, olives, onion, fennel, and chopped basil.  Add salt and pepper to taste, if you wish, and mix well.  Pack the mixture tightly into a 6-cup round mold or an elongated 12- by 4-inch loaf pan.  Cover the mold with foil.  Refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.

Unmold the rice onto a platter and garnish with sliced fresh tomatoes and basil leaves.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  One of the dishes we had in the summertime was a cold rice salad that was filling enough to serve as the main course.  There was no rhyme or reason as to what went into this dish; it just evolved as various leftovers were taken out of the refrigerator.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  leeks -- trimmed, and
                        dark green leaves removed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  4               cups  hot chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced thyme
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of white pepper
                        Grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese -- for sprinkling

Cut the leeks in half lengthwise.  Wash them well to remove any dirt and cut them into thin slices.

Melt the butter in a 3-quart saucepan, add the leeks and cook them very slowly until they soften, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour and cook 1 minute.  Slowly pour in the broth and stir to keep the mixture smooth.  Cook over medium heat until the mixture is soft and pureed-looking but not too thick, about 10 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat.  Stir in the thyme, salt and pepper.  Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and sprinkle with the cheese.

Serve the leeks in small bowls accompanied with slices of toasted bread.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Leeks, part of the onion family, were favorites of the ancient Romans and are still much appreciated today in Tuscan cooking.  In this preparation the objective is to achieve a thick, smooth, and creamy consistency.

         Eggplant Preserved In Olive Oil - {Melanzane Sott'Olio}

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  eggplants
                        Red wine vinegar
                        Coarse sea salt -- as needed
     1/4           cup  diced red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  diced green bell peppers
     1/4           cup  diced yellow bell peppers
                        Fresh basil leaves
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     sterilized pint jars - (to 4)

Wash and dry the eggplants, remove the stems, and cut the eggplants into 1/4-inch rounds.  Place in a deep nonmetal bowl and cover with vinegar.  Place a double layer of wax paper over the eggplants and place a bowl filled with water on top to keep the eggplants submerged.  Let marinate at room temperature for 2 days.

Squeeze the vinegar out of the eggplants with your hands and layer the slices in the sterilized jars, sprinkling each layer with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt.  Divide the bell peppers among the jars.  Add 1 or 2 basil leaves and pepper to taste to each jar.  When the jars are three-quarters full, add olive oil to cover the eggplant mixture, pushing down on it with a wooden spoon to submerge it.  Top off each jar with oil before capping it.  Let the jars sit overnight at room temperature.

If the eggplant has absorbed some of the oil and the slices are poking through the oil, add more oil to cover them completely.  Cap again and let sit overnight.

Add more oil to the jars if necessary so that the eggplant is fully submerged under the oil.  Cap the jars, put them in a very cool place, and let ripen for 6 weeks before using them.  Refrigerate after opening.

Variation:  To serve as an antipasto, cut thick slices of good country bread or Pane Rustico, place the slices on a baking sheet, and toast in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes, or until light golden brown.  Remove the slices to individual serving dishes, and rub the slices with whole peeled garlic cloves.  Layer a few of the eggplant slices on each slice of bread and drizzle on a little of the oil from the eggplant jar.

Note:  Do not cut corners with this recipe.  Sterilized jars and caps are a must, as are the freshest ingredients.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 pints.

Comments:  Preserving raw eggplant in olive oil is a very old tradition.  Make this any time of year, since eggplants are available year-round, or, if you have a garden, preserve the bumper crop.  When guests drop in, I serve this over toasted slices of good bread.  Make sure to top off the jars with olive oil to ensure the eggplants' long shelf life.

                        cut into quarters
  1             medium  yellow onion -- peeled and quartered
  2                     celery ribs with leaves -- quartered
  6                     scallions, green tops only -- cut into quarters
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  rosemary sprig -- needles only
  8               cups  chicken broth
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1                     thinly-sliced red onion -- for garnish

Soak the beans overnight covered in cold water.

Drain the beans and put them in a soup pot with the carrot, onion, celery, scallions, olive oil, and rosemary.  Add the chicken broth.  Bring the ingredients to a boil, then lower the heat and cook covered until the beans are tender, when the skin easily slips off the beans.  This will take about 50 minutes.

Puree the soup in batches in a food processor or in a blender until it is smooth.  Transfer the soup to a soup pot; season with salt and pepper to taste.  Reheat the mixture until hot, then pour into a soup tureen or ladle from the pot into soup bowls and top each with a few onion slices.  Pass extra olive oil to drizzle on top of the soup.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  Serve this nutritious and filling pureed soup made from dried red kidney beans, carrots, celery, onion, and rosemary in your most elegant soup tureen.  These humble ingredients create such a rich flavor, and yet this is another good example of the simplicity of Umbrian cooking.  Try making it with a variety of dried beans such as cannellini, chickpea, and cranberry beans.  Soak the beans overnight to cut down on the cooking time.

                     Farro Soup - {Minestra Di Farro}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     meaty ham or prosciutto bone
  4                     plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  2                     celery ribs with leaves -- cut into quarters
  1             medium  onion -- peeled
  1                     small bunch Italian parsley
  1                cup  farro
                        Grated Pecorino cheese
                        Colavita extra-virgin olive oil

Put the bone, tomatoes, carrots, celery, onion, and parsley in a soup pot.  Add enough cold water just to cover the ingredients and bring them to a boil.  Lower the heat to simmer, cover the pot and cook for 1 hour.  Remove the ham bone with a slotted spoon and set aside.  Strain the broth and vegetables through a colander lined with cheesecloth set over a bowl.  Reserve the carrots and celery.

Return the broth to the soup pot and bring to a boil.  Stir in the farro and cook covered for about 30 minutes or until the farro is tender but not mushy; it should not disintegrate in the broth.

While the farro is cooking, remove the meat from the bone and cut it into pieces.  Cut the carrots and celery into small pieces.  Add the ham, carrots, and celery to the soup once the farro is cooked.  Season the soup with salt and pepper and serve hot.  Pass the cheese and olive oil for sprinkling and drizzling on top of the soup.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Farro cooked with a ham bone reminds me so much of making split pea soup.  In Umbria a prosciutto bone is used to flavor the soup, but any ham bone will do.  I can only imagine how good this would be with sedano nero, black celery, but nevertheless, it is hearty, delicious, and close to Umbrian tradition.

                    Fava Bean And Macaroni Soup - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried split fava beans - (10 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  anelletti
                        = (or other small macaroni)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (16 oz) -- diced, and
                        juice reserved
  4               cups  beef stock
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  1                cup  fresh or frozen peas
                        Freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese -- for sprinkling

Put the fava beans in a large pot, add 8 cups of water, and bring to a boil.  Cook the beans, covered, for 12 minutes.  Add the anelletti and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes, or until the macaroni is al dente and the beans are tender but not mushy.  Drain well.

While the beans and macaroni are cooking, heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic, and parsley, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until the onions are wilted.  Add the tomatoes, the reserved juice, and the beef stock, bring to a simmer, and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the salt.

Stir the fava beans and macaroni into the soup.  Add the peas and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle with the cheese.

Note:  The longer this soup sits, the thicker it gets.  If you prefer, thin it with a little water or additional stock.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  When I am up to my elbows in biscotti dough during the holidays, I like to have supper ready and waiting.  That's when I'm sure to have a large soup pot full of fava bean and macaroni soup on the back burner.  Dried fava beans, which are available year-round, and anelletti, small ring-shaped pasta, make this a very satisfying soup.  Beef bouillon cubes and water can be substituted for the stock.

             Fava Bean Puree With Chicory - {Fave E Cicoria}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried split fava beans - (8 oz)
  2             medium  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled and quartered
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  chicory -- stemmed, washed,
                        and drained

Put the beans and potatoes in a pot, add enough water to cover, and add the salt.  Bring to a boil and boil uncovered for about 30 minutes, or until the beans are tender but not mushy.  Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.

Transfer the beans and potatoes to a food processor.  Add 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the oil and the reserved cooking water, and puree smooth.  Remove the puree to a saucepan and keep warm over very low heat.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the chicory and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain well, and spread the chicory on a serving platter.

Spoon the fava bean puree over the chicory.  Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the top and serve immediately.

Variations:  Serve the puree topped with strips of roasted red and yellow bell peppers.  Pack the fava puree into an oiled 4-cup mold, then unmold it onto the chicory for a party presentation.  Or use individual molds and serve on small portions of chicory.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  I'm fond of this dried fava bean dish from Puglia, made with nothing more than cooked and pureed fava beans, flavored with the dense, fruity olive oil of the region and served with boiled chicory.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Spread the tomatoes over the top of the mixture, cover the pan and cook over simmering heat for 45 minutes.  Uncover and cook until the mixture has thickened.  Set aside.

Mix the ground beef, pork, celery salt, pepper flakes, Worcestshire sauce and rice together in a bowl.

Spread half of the zucchini mixture in a 1 1/2-quart casserole.  Pat the meat mixture on top of the zucchini, then cover with the remaining zucchini mixture.

Bake covered in a 350 degrees oven for 30 minutes.  Uncover, sprinkle the cheese over the top and continue baking an additional 20 minutes.

       Gnocchi And Escarole Soup - {Zuppa Di Gnocchetti E Scarola}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried red kidney beans -- picked over
  7               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1                cup  gnocchetti, orzo, or ditalini
     1/4         pound  pancetta or bacon -- diced
  1              large  leek (abt 8 oz), white part only -- washed well,
                        and thinly sliced
  1              pound  escarole -- washed, drained,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  celery salt
  3               cups  hot beef broth or veal stock
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
                        Grinding of black pepper
                        Rinds of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Soak the beans overnight in 2 cups of the water.  Next day, drain the beans, put them in a 2-quart saucepan, cover them with water, bring them to a boil, and continue to let them boil until just al dente, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain the beans, reserving 2 cups of the cooking water, place them in a large bowl, and set aside.

Refill the saucepan with the remaining 5 cups water, bring to a boil, stir in 1 teaspoon of the salt and the gnocchetti and cook over medium-high heat until just al dente.  Drain and add the gnocchetti to the kidney beans.

In a soup pot, slowly brown the pancetta over medium heat, stirring often until it softens and begins to render some of its fat.  Add the sliced leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft.  Stir in the escarole, remaining teaspoon salt, celery salt, stock, reserved cooking water, tomato paste, pepper, and cheese rinds.  Cover the pot, bring the mixture to a boil, and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Uncover the pot, stir in the kidney beans and gnocchetti, cover the pot, and cook 5 minutes longer before serving.

Tip:  Clean escarole well by soaking it in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain and rinse again in a colander.  This also works for leeks.  Cut them in half lengthwise first.

Tip:  When you can no longer grate the remaining Parmigiano cheese near the rind, add the rind to the soup pot along with the stock and water.  At the end of the cooking time, remove the rinds, scrape off the softened cheese, discarding the rind, and stir it back into the soup.

Note:  The soup can be made several days ahead but will thicken as it stands.  Reheat it, adding warm water if a thinner consistency is desired.

from "Mangia Pasta!" by Mary A. Esposito, (Morrow Cookbooks, 1998)

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  To me, tiny cuts of macaroni such as gnocchetti, the shell-shaped pasta used in this recipe, will always be synonymous with comfort food.  In an Italian kitchen it was the role of soup not only to satisfy but to soothe and heal, especially when one had a cold or an upset stomach.  In this filling soup the goal is a balance of flavors, which come together beautifully.

Any type of dried bean can be used, but if you are really pressed for time, canned beans can be substituted if they are drained and rinsed well.  Cooking the beans and pasta separately retains the texture of each ingredient.

                Grandma Galasso's Eggplant Pyramids - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  eggplant -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
  1              small  zucchini -- cut 1/8"-thk rounds
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  3              small  plum tomatoes -- cut thin rounds
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/4         pound  fresh mozzarella cheese -- shredded

Preheat the oven the 375 degrees.

Lightly brush a baking sheet with olive oil.  Arrange the eggplant slices in rows on the sheet.  Brush the slices lightly with olive oil.  Top each slice with a zucchini round and brush them with olive oil.  Sprinkle the oregano over the tops of the zucchini.  Place a tomato slice over each zucchini round and brush the top with olive oil.  Sprinkle a little salt over the top of each tomato.

Bake for 25 minutes.  Sprinkle the cheese over the tomatoes and continue to bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese has just melted.  Serve hot.

Variation:  Use the broiler to melt the cheese-topped rounds instead of baking them.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  It would be fair to say that eggplant plays a large role in Neapolitan cuisine.  As a child I loathed having to eat it in the many ways that my Nonna Galasso cooked it.  She would probably clap her hands if she could see how much I utilize it today and how much I have grown to like it!  I make this quick antipasto when my garden is bursting with royal-purple eggplant, redder-than-red tomatoes, and forest-green zucchini.  The combination is delightful in this stackable antipasto.  The idea is to make each layer of vegetables progressively smaller, like a pyramid.

              Grated Pasta Soup - {Zuppa Di Pasta Grattata}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1                cup  toasted fresh bread crumbs
                        Grated zest of 1 medium lemon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             quarts  chicken or beef broth

To make the pasta, in a bowl, mix the flour, cheese, and bread crumbs together.  In another bowl, mix the remaining ingredients together.  Add to the flour mixture and mix well.  Gather the dough into a ball; the dough will be quite rough.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 to 7 hours, or overnight, or until firm enough to grate.

Using the large holes of a cheese grater, grate the dough into a clean towel.

In a large pot, bring the broth to a boil.  Add the pasta and boil for about 5 minutes, or until the pasta floats to the surface.  Serve immediately.

Note:  This pasta freezes very well.  If you like, double the pasta recipe and freeze half to have on hand for a quick soup.  Spread the uncooked pasta out on a floured baking sheet and freeze until hard.  Transfer to plastic bags and freeze.  Do not defrost before cooking.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  I remember my mother making a coarse type of pasta that was grated on a cheese grater and then cooked in boiling chicken or beef broth.  The pasta had a distinct lemon flavor because of all the grated lemon zest that was mixed into the dough.  This is a very old recipe with many variations.

To make the pasta, in a bowl, mix the flour, cheese, and bread crumbs together.  In another bowl, mix the remaining ingredients together.  Add to the flour mixture and mix well.  Gather the dough into a ball; the dough will be quite rough.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 to 7 hours, or overnight, or until firm enough to grate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using the large holes of a cheese grater, grate the dough into a clean towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot, bring the broth to a boil.  Add the pasta and boil for about 5 minutes, or until the pasta floats to the surface.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  This pasta freezes very well.  If you like, double the pasta recipe and freeze half to have on hand for a quick soup.  Spread the uncooked pasta out on a floured baking sheet and freeze until hard.  Transfer to plastic bags and freeze.  Do not defrost before cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  I remember my mother making a coarse type of pasta that was grated on a cheese grater and then cooked in boiling chicken or beef broth.  The pasta had a distinct lemon flavor because of all the grated lemon zest that was mixed into the dough.  This is a very old recipe with many variations.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FIGS ===
  6                     fresh figs
                        = (preferably Black Mission)
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  good quality balsamic vinegar
  2             ounces  mountain gorgonzola, or gorgonzola dolce -- crumbled coarsely
                        === FOR THE CROSTINI ===
  8             slices  baguette or country bread
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  2               cups  washed arugula
  1                cup  radicchio -- cored, and
                        cut into thin strips
  1                cup  endive -- cut thin slivers
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        A few grinds of fresh pepper
  1         tablespoon  good quality balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil

Prepare the fig topping:  gently wash the figs and pat them dry.  Cut off the tops and then cut the figs into 1/2-inch cubes.

Place the olive oil and figs into a small non-stick skillet and cook over medium-high heat until the figs begin to break down.  Add the balsamic vinegar and stir to combine well and then immediately off the heat.  Allow the cooked figs to cool for 30 minutes before adding the crumbled gorgonzola and mixing it in very well.  This mixture can be stored tightly covered in the refrigerator overnight.

When ready to serve preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Fry the baguette slices in the olive oil in a non-stick skillet and when golden brown on both sides drain on paper toweling.

Place the crostini on a baking pan and top each with a nice pile of the fig and gorgonzola mixture.  Bake in your preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes until the mixture is hot and bubbling.

Meanwhile place the arugula, radicchio and endive in a mixing bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and then toss with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Divide the salad among 4 plates and then place two fig and gorgonzola crostini on each salad plate and serve.

This recipe yields 4 first course servings.

Comments:  I have chosen to present these crostini with a simple salad for a sit-down first course.  Of course these crostini would make a great canape if served on a platter and passed to your guests.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE TORTELLI ===
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
     1/2         pound  ricotta cheese -- well drained
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1             recipe  Handmade Pasta dough
  4             quarts  water per each 4 dozen tortelli
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- plus
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Cover the potatoes with cold water in a medium-size saucepan, bring to a boil, and boil until a knife slides easily into them.  Drain the potatoes, transfer them to a large bowl, and mash them with a hand masher until smooth.  Stir in the ricotta cheese, egg, salt, and nutmeg.  Set the mixture aside.

Divide the dough into four pieces and work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining pieces under a bowl.

If making the tortelli by hand, roll each piece with a rolling pin into a 14-inch circle.  Using a 2-inch fluted round cutter, cut circles from the dough as close together as possible.  Gather up the scraps and re-roll to make more circles.  Place 1/4 teaspoon of the potato filing in the center of each circle.  Fold the circle in half to make a half-moon or crescent shape and pinch the edges together to form a tight seal so the filling will not ooze out.  If the dough seems dry, brush the edges with a little water before sealing them.  Place the tortelli on kitchen-towel-lined cookie sheets in single layers.  Continue making tortelli with the remaining dough and filling.

If using a pasta machine, roll each piece of dough with a rolling pin to flatten it slightly, then thin the dough through the rollers of the pasta machine to the thinnest setting.  Cut out circles and fill as above.  Gather up and re-roll the scraps to make more tortelli.

Fill a pasta pot with an insert with the water.  When the water boils, add the salt and tortelli and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the cheese, pour the sauce into a serving bowl or platter, and keep warm (makes enough sauce for 4 dozen tortelli).  Use a pasta scoop to drain the tortelli.  Transfer them to the warm serving dish and toss gently with the sauce.  Serve immediately.

Tip:  Keep several wet paper towels handy to wipe your hands as you are filling the tortelli so they will be clean to pinch the edges closed.

Note:  To freeze for future use, cover the uncooked tortelli with a sheet of plastic wrap and place in the freezer on the towel-lined cookie sheet until hard.  Transfer the tortelli to heavy-duty plastic bags and freeze.  Do not defrost the tortelli before cooking them.  Bring the water to a rolling boil before cooking them.  They will take about 2 minutes longer to cook than freshly made.

This recipe yields about 16 dozen.

Comments:  Tortelli (anolini) are filled half-moon shaped pasta from the region of Emilia-Romagna.  Some of the best I have ever eaten were sampled in Mamiano, in the Fondazione Magnani Rocca, after visiting a fabulous art collection belonging to the late Luigi Magnani and supported by the Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano.  There were several kinds of tortelli on the menu, some filled with Swiss chard, others with pumpkin, and these potato-and-ricotta-cheese ones flavored with the famed Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese of the region and just a hint of nutmeg.  Tortelli are traditionally served with butter and more cheese.  They are time consuming to make, but the filling can be prepared a day ahead, the dough can be made in a food processor, and the tortelli can be frozen for several months.  Tortelli are eaten as a first course, usually either eight to ten per serving.

        Ham And Lentil Timbale - {Prosciutto E Lenticchia Timbale}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Italian
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  fine bread crumbs -- toasted
  1                cup  lentils or mixed lentils
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
     1/4         pound  ham from a ham bone -- cut small pieces
                        = (prosciuto may be substituted)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  non-fat half-and-half
  4                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  minced parsley

Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to grease a 4- to 5-cup springform pan or casserole dish.  Coat it with the bread crumbs and refrigerate.

Pour the lentils into a saucepan, cover with 2 1/2 cups of water and cook until tender.  Drain the lentils in a colander and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter in a saute pan, stir in the onions and cook them until they are transparent.  Stir in the ham and lentils and cook for 2 minutes.  Season with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.

In a saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat and whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste.  Slowly pour in the half-and-half, whisking constantly to keep the mixture smooth.  Stir until the mixture thickens enough to coat a spoon.  Stir in the remaining salt and the parsley and remove the sauce from the heat.  Add the ham and lentils to the sauce and then the egg yolks, stirring them in one at a time.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pour the mixture into the mold and smooth out the top.  Bake for 25 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.

Unmold the timbale onto a serving dish and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                  Handmade Pasta - {Pasta Fatta A Mano}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  4              large  eggs.

Combine the flours and salt and mound on a work surface.  With your fist make a hole in the center of the mound.  This is the fontana, or well.  Crack the eggs into the center of the well and beat gently with a fork or your fingers to break up the egg yolks.  Using one hand and moving in a clockwise fashion, begin bringing the flour from inside the four wall into the eggs.  Use your other hand to keep the outside of the wall together.  If the wall breaks, the eggs will seep out.

Continue mixing until a ball of dough is created that is not soupy and holds its shape.  Push the excess flour aside and knead the dough until a smooth, soft ball is obtained.  Don't worry if you do not use all the flour; adding too much flour will result in a tough dough.  On the other hand, if the dough is still sticky, add the remaining flour a little at a time until the desired consistency is obtained.  Any leftover flour can be used to dust the sheets of dough whey they are cut.

Knead the dough until a smooth ball is obtained, then let the dough rest for 30 minutes on a floured surface covered with a bowl or a damp kitchen towel.  This will allow the gluten in the dough to relax and allow you to roll it out with ease.

This recipe yields about 1 1/4 pounds.

                  Homemade Beef Broth - {Brodo Di Manzo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Italian
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef skin
  1              pound  beef brisket
  2                     beef neck bones - (to 3)
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken parts
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
  4             sprigs  flat-leaf parsley - (to 5)
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     red onions -- cut in half
  2                     carrots -- peeled and quartered
  2                     celery ribs with leaves -- cut in half
  2                     plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  5                     black peppercorns

Put all the meat and the chicken in a large stockpot and cover with cold water.  Add the salt and bring to a boil.  Skim off the foam with a slotted spoon.

Tie the parsley, thyme, and bay leaf together with kitchen string and add to the pot.  Lower the heat to medium, and add all the remaining ingredients, and stir with a wooden spoon.  Let the broth simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  (The chicken will cook faster than the other meat; remove it when tender, after about 1 hour.  Let cool, and remove the meat from the bones to use in another dish.)  As the broth cooks, skim off the foam that collects on the top with a slotted spoon.

When the meat is tender, remove it along with the bones and reserve for another use.  Pour the broth and vegetables into a colander lined with damp cheesecloth set over another pot.  Press on the solids with the back of a wooden spoon to release all the juices.  Discard the solids.  The broth is ready to use.  It can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.

Note:  If you want clear broth, mix 1 large egg white with a cup of the cooled broth and return this mixture to the pot of strained broth.  Bring both to a boil and, using a wire whisk, whisk the mixture vigorously until the residue begins to float to the surface.  Let simmer gently, without stirring, to allow the residue to accumulate on the surface; remove the residue with the slotted spoon.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  3 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4)
                        === FILLING ===
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  leeks -- dark green stem
                        tops and roots removed
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Pinot Grigio)
  2              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding of white pepper
     1/4         pound  prosciutto, mortadella, or cooked ham -- diced

Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water and allow to get chalky looking, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the yeast mixture to the bowl of a food processor or pour it into a large bowl if doing this by hand.  Pour in the remaining water, the olive oil, and egg and combine well.

Add the salt and 3 1/2 cups of the flour.  Pulse to mix the ingredients or mix by hand.  Stir in the remaining flour, a little at a time, until a smooth ball of dough moves away from the side of the processor or the bowl.  The dough should feel soft and smooth and not stick to your hands.  You may or may not need all the flour.

If you used the food processor, transfer the dough to a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Otherwise use the same bowl you worked the dough in by hand.  Allow the dough to double in size (about 2 hours) in a warm spot.

Meanwhile make the filling.  Wash the leeks well as they can be very sandy.  Dry them with paper towels and cut them lengthwise and then widthwise in 1/4-inch thick slices.

In a large saute pan heat the olive oil, add the leeks and cook them covered over low heat stirring frequently until they soften, about 5 minutes.  Uncover the pan, raise the heat to high, pour in the wine and allow most of it to evaporate.  Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low and cook until the leeks are very soft and creamy looking.  Transfer the leeks to a bowl and when they are cool, stir in the eggs, salt, and a good grinding of the pepper.  Cover and refrigerate the mixture until ready to fill the tart shell.  This step can be done two days ahead of time.

Lightly spray a 10 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and set aside.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Punch down the dough with your fists and divide it in half; roll one half into a 13-inch round, and fit it into the tart shell.  Cut off the excess dough with a scissors.  Scatter the prosciutto in the base of the shell, then spread the leek mixture over the top.  Roll out the second half of the dough to fit the top of the tart pan, allowing for the dough to overhang the pan.  Gently roll over the top of the tart shell with a rolling pin to cut off the excess dough.

Reroll the scraps and use a cookie cutter to make designs for the top of the tart if you wish, or simply make a couple of small rolls to bake along with the tart.  Bake the tart for 35 to 40 minutes or until the top is nicely browned.  Allow the tart to cool before removing the side rim.  Cut the tart into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.

Note:  The Roman emperor Nero ate leeks every day to keep his throat clear, since he loved to sing and believed that leeks kept his vocal chords in condition.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Porrata means a leek tart, originally made to commemorate religious functions held in San Lorenzo during August.  This tart is usually an antipasto but it can be a main course.  It may seem like an overabundance of leeks is called for in this recipe, but it makes the perfect amount of filling for a 10 1/2-inch tart pan.  The dough is easily made in a food processor or by hand and you can make the filling two days ahead of time.

          Lentil And Rice Soup - {Minestra Di Lenticchie E Riso}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  lentils
  1           teaspoon  butter or lard
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  minced Italian parsley
  1                cup  long grain rice
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped canned plum tomatoes
  6               cups  chicken broth
                        Grated Pecorino cheese for sprinkling

Pour the lentils into a soup pot; cover them with cold water and boil them for 25 minutes.  Drain the lentils and set aside.  They should hold their shape, be cooked through and not mushy.  Drain them and set aside.

In that same pot, melt the butter or lard; stir in the garlic and parsley and cook until the garlic softens but does not brown.  Stir in the rice, tomatoes with their juice, and the broth.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Lower the heat to simmer; cover the pot and continue cooking until the rice is tender.  This should take about 25 minutes.  Stir in the lentils and cook just to re-heat the soup.  Serve immediately and pass grated cheese to sprinkle on top.

This recipe yields 3 quarts.

Comments:  The plains of Castelluccio in Umbria are famous for the production of the most famous lentils in all of Italy; they are prized for their delicacy and for their long shelf life.  The lentils are minute in size, just 2 millimeters, but they pack a huge nutritional wallop.  They are very high in protein and a rich source of vitamins and fiber.  Historical records show that lentils were being cultivated as early as 7000 B.C. in southwest Asia and the cultivation spread to Greece and Rome.  The lentils of Castelluccio have a very soft skin that means they do not require overnight soaking.  You can find lentils from Castelluccio in Italian specialty stores.  There are three authentic types of Castelluccio lentils: Green, reddish, and grained.

Lentils are a popular item on the Italian New Year's Day table because they are thought of as good luck omens; this comes from the custom of giving a "scarsella" (purse) full of lentils at the end of the year in the hope that each lentil would turn into a coin, making the recipient one lucky and rich person.  This filling lentil and rice soup can be made in less than an hour and needs only a salad to provide a complete and well-balanced meal.

                   Lentil Soup - {Zuppa Di Lenticchie}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  lentils
  2             quarts  water
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- sliced
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with liquid
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  acini di pepe or pastina
                        Freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Place the lentils in a bowl, add water to cover, and soak overnight.

Drain and discard the soaking water.  Wash the lentils well in warm water, place in a soup pot, cover with the 2 quarts water, and bring to a boil.  Add the oil, onion, celery, and tomatoes.  Lower the heat and simmer the mixture, covered, for about 35 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.  (The cooking time will be about 1 1/2 hours if the lentils were not presoaked.)

Add salt, pepper, and the pasta.  Cook for about 15 minutes longer, or until pasta is al dente.  Ladle the soup into bowls and serve immediately, sprinkled with a little Pecorino Romano.

Variation:  Add pieces of cooked chicken or sausage to the soup along with the pasta.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  My dad remembers his mother's (Nonna Saporito) endless use of lentils; lentil soup and lentils with sausage were two familiar dishes when he was growing up.  I presoak lentils the night before making this soup; this step can be eliminated, but the cooking time will be longer.  At the end of the cooking time, I add a tiny soup pasta called acini di pepe for added texture and taste.  This is a thick, hearty soup, which keeps well and may need to be thinned the next day with a little water or broth.

                    Lettuce And Green Bean Soup - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              heads  romaine lettuce - (2 lbs total)
  6             ounces  fresh green beans -- cut into thirds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1 1/2           cups  cubed bread slices
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  1                     shallot -- diced
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  6               cups  hot beef broth
  2              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     2/3           cup  grated Asiago or Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

Remove the cores from the lettuce, tear into pieces, and place in a colander.  Rinse the lettuce well and let drain.

Cook the beans in boiling salted water until tender, but not mushy, about 7 minutes.  Drain the beans well and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the bread cubes on a baking sheet and toast until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.  Place in a bowl and set aside.

In a soup pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallot and saute until limp but not brown.  Sprinkle on the flour and mix with a wooden spoon until incorporated.  Mixture will appear pasty but will smooth out.  Add the hot broth and continue to stir with a whisk until the mixture begins to boil.  Add the lettuce, stir the mixture well, lower the heat, cover the pot, and cook for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Place the soup in a food processor or blender in batches and process until smooth.  Return the soup to the pot and keep warm over low heat.

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cream.  Add 1 cup of the soup to the egg mixture and whisk to blend.  Add the egg mixture to the soup pot and whisk for about 4 or 5 minutes.  Add the beans, cheese, nutmeg, and remaining salt to the soup and stir well.

To serve, ladle the hot soup into individual bowls, sprinkle a few toasted bread cubes on top of each, and serve at once.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  My grandmothers looked upon green leafy vegetables as good candidates for soup.  But I thought they went too far when I watched them making soup from lettuce!  They used bitter lettuce, but I have changed their recipe and use romaine.  This is a refreshing soup in the summer, but since the ingredients are available year-round, you can enjoy it any time.

              Little Hats In Broth - {Cappelletti In Brodo}

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEAT FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  boneless pork cutlet -- cut small chunks
     1/4         pound  boneless sirloin steak -- cut small chunks
     1/4         pound  boneless veal roast -- cut small chunks
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Thinly-sliced lemon
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for sprinkling
                        === CAPPELLETTI DOUGH ===
  4              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/4)

Meat Filling:  Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a saute pan; brown the meat pieces well on all sides.  Do this in batches if necessary; do not crowd the meat or it will not brown uniformly.  As the pieces brown, remove them to a dish.

Grind the meats together in a food processor or meat grinder until they are almost a paste consistency; transfer the meats to a large bowl.  Stir in the egg, cheese, parsley, zest, nutmeg, and salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Cover and refrigerate the mixture until ready to fill the pasta rounds.

Cappelletti Dough:  Whirl the eggs and salt together in a food processor or whisk them together in a bowl.  Gradually add the flour until a ball of dough forms that is not tacky or sticking to our hands.  What you want to achieve is a smooth, not too dry dough or it will be difficult to seal the edges of the dough when forming the cappelletti.

Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface until it is silky and very smooth.  Cut the ball into 4 pieces and work with one at a time.  Flatten each piece with a rolling pin; run each piece through the rollers of a pasta machine to thin it out.  Do not make it too thin or the filling will poke through the dough.  If you can just see your hand when placed behind the sheet of dough, it is thin enough.  Alternately use a rolling pin to thin the dough.

I like to use a 1-inch round cutter to cut circles out of the dough; re-roll the scraps to make more circles.  Place a scant 1/2 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each circle, then enclose the filling in the dough by forming a half moon and pinching the edges closed with your fingers.  If the dough will not seal, brush a little water or beaten egg white along the edges before sealing the dough.

As you make the cappelletti, line them up on towel-lined baking sheets.  Do not pile them on top of each other or they may stick together.  Freeze them on the trays, and when frozen transfer them to heavy-duty plastic bags.  Take out as needed and cook them in boiling broth just until they bob to the surface.  Ladle the cappelletti into soup bowls, add a thin slice of lemon, and sprinkle the top with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

This recipe yields about 150 pieces.

Comments:  Cappelletti, "little hats", are plump meat-filled pasta served in rich capon or chicken broth.  The best are said to come from Gubbio where it is a tradition, as in many other parts of Italy, to have them on Christmas.  Some historical references claim that the hat shape originated from the pointed hats that Spanish soldiers wore when they invaded Italy in the seventeenth century.  Cappelletti can be pointed or round; the point is that no matter what the shape, they are a delicate beginning to any Sunday dinner or special occasion.  I will note deceive you -- these are time-consuming to make but the reward is in every spoonful.  Make them ahead, and freeze them.  Use large eggs for the dough, and lean meats for the filling; do not skimp on the lemon zest.  This recipe makes approximately 150 cappelletti.  Six to eight are plenty for an individual serving.  To serve six you will need two quarts of the broth and three to four dozen of the cappelletti.

        Little Toasts With Chicken Liver Spread - {Crostini Neri}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chicken livers
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- minced
  2                     anchovy fillets -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry Tuscan vin santo
                        = (or dry white wine)
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
                        = (or beef broth or water)
  1         tablespoon  salted capers -- rinsed, drained,
                        and chopped
                        Freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- to taste
  12            slices  toasted bread

Pick over the chicken livers, cutting away any green spots and removing any tough bits of fiber.  Rinse gently and briefly in a colander and set aside to drain.

Heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a saute pan and when it is hot stir in the onions, garlic, and half the parsley and cook gently until the onion is soft and pale yellow, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the anchovies and use a fork to mash them into the other ingredients.

Pat the chicken livers dry with paper towels.  Raise the heat to medium, push the vegetable mixture to one side, and add the livers in the center of the pan.  Cook, tossing the livers to brown quickly.  As they cook, chop them coarsely with a wooden spoon.  After they have changed color from rosy to brown, stir in the wine and broth.  Lower the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until the livers are uniform in color and most of the liquid has been absorbed.  As the livers cook, continue to break them up with a fork or spoon until they form a coarse paste which is traditional.  If you prefer a smoother texture, process the mixture in a food processor.  Stir in the capers and remaining parsley along with the lemon juice and mix well.  Taste and add salt if necessary along with lots of black pepper and more lemon juice if desired.

Spread the liver mixture among the bread slices and place them on a serving platter.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 antipasto servings.

Comments:  For Crostini Neri, Little Black Toasts, Nancy makes a chicken liver spread; this is the most classic Tuscan topping for crostini.

        Minestrone, Genoa Style - {Minestrone Alla Moda Genovese}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  cannellini or borlotti (cranberry) beans -- soaked overnight
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2                     leeks, white part only -- washed and chopped
  1             medium  eggplant - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled and diced
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled and sliced
  2                     celery ribs -- sliced
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled and diced
  2             medium  tomatoes -- diced
  2               cups  hot chicken broth
  4               cups  hot water
  1                cup  chopped raw spinach
  1                cup  diced zucchini
  1                cup  shredded green cabbage
     1/4         pound  vermicelli or stelline
  3        tablespoons  Pesto Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Drain the beans from the soaking water, place them in a pot, cover with water, and cook about 30 minutes, or until still quite al dente, and set aside.

In a large pot, heat the oil.  Add the onion, leeks, eggplant, carrots, celery, and potatoes and saute for about 8 minutes, or until the vegetables just begin to exude their juices.

Add the tomatoes, hot broth, hot water, beans, and additional hot water to just cover the mixture.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and cook covered for about 30 minutes.

Add the spinach, zucchini, cabbage, and pasta and cook another 20 minutes or until the pasta is al dente.  Stir in the Pesto Sauce.  Add salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.

Note:  There is a saying in Genoa that chi mangia pesto, non lascia mai Genova -- "He who eats pesto never leaves Genoa."

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  In Genoa as well as in Sorrento, this soup is often eaten at room temperature, although in Sorrento, pesto is not added.  The soup is often eaten on Sunday night, after the big meal on Sunday afternoon; and in many small villages, it is still made with rainwater collected in barrels.  Be sure to soak the beans a day before you make the soup.

                     Mixed Green Salad - {Misticanza}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        = (or fresh lemon juice)
                        === SALAD ===
  1                cup  washed and dried chicory leaves
  1                cup  washed and dried escarole leaves
  1                cup  washed and dried dandelion greens
  1                cup  washed and dried radicchio leaves

Mix the salad dressing ingredients in a jar and set aside.

Toss the greens together in a large salad bowl.  Pour the dressing over the greens and toss well.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  An Italian mixed green salad is not likely to include iceberg lettuce, known in Italy as crocantine or Braziliana.  Rather the salad bowl is filled with a delightful mixture of bitter greens including chicory, escarole, dandelion greens, and crunchy radicchio and is anything but boring.  It is a work of edible art, a refreshing wake-up call for the palate, and a reminder that Italians know how to enjoy the bitter with the sweet.

       Molded Tomato Bread Salad - {Sformato Di Pane Stratificato}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  cider or wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced oregano
                        = (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely minced
                        === FILLING ===
  2             ounces  arugola leaves -- stemmed, washed,
                        and dried and left whole
  5                     lengthwise 1/4"-thk bread slices cut
                        from a 20-oz loaf of white bread
  1              large  red beefsteak tomato - (abt 4 oz) -- cut thin rounds
  1              large  yellow beefsteak tomato - (abt 4 oz) -- cut thin rounds

Line an 8 1/2- by 3 1/2- by 5-inch loaf pan with a sheet of plastic wrap, leaving an overhang all around the mold.  Set aside.

To make the dressing, combine all the ingredients in a jar, shake well and set aside.  The dressing can be made several days ahead and stored in the refrigerator.  Bring to room temperature before using.

To prepare the filling and assemble the salad, make a design with a few of the arugula leaves in the bottom of the mold.  Save the rest to place between the layers.

Trim the bread slices to fit neatly in the bread pan (about 7 1/2 by 4 inches if using the called-for bread pan).  Place one of the bread slices over the arugula in the bottom of the bread pan.  Brush the bread with some of the dressing.  Make a layer of red tomato slices over the bread.  Cut up a few slices to fill in any gaps along the sides.  Brush the tomatoes with a little of the dressing.  Place a layer of arugola leaves over the tomatoes and brush them with a little of the dressing.  Lay a second bread slice over the arugula leaves and repeat brushing with the dressing.  Add a layer of the yellow tomatoes, filling in any gaps with pieces of cut tomatoes and brush them with the dressing.  Add another layer of arugola leaves and brush with a little of the dressing.  Continue to make three more layers in the same manner, ending with a bread layer.  Brush the top of the bread with any remaining dressing.

Cover the pan tightly with a piece of plastic wrap and bring the overhanging edges over the top.  Press on the loaf with your hand to make sure the loaf is compacted and even with the top edges of the pan.  Refrigerate the loaf for several hours.

Unwrap the top of the loaf and place a platter over the top and invert the loaf onto the platter.  Remove the plastic wrap and discard it.  Use a tomato knife to cut the loaf into slices.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Tip:  A tomato knife has a serrated blade that cuts tomatoes without tearing them.  Tomato knives are available from kitchen and cutlery stores.

Comments:  One of the early episodes of Ciao Italia dealt with how to make traditional salads using slightly bitter greens like escarole and chicory.  Since then, I have demonstrated a number of other salads, including bread salad, made with chunks of dense and slightly stale bread that had been soaked in vinegar and combined with wedges of juicy tomatoes and pungent basil leaves.  In this version of bread salad, a loaf pan is used to create a molded, layered salad of red and yellow tomatoes and peppery arugula leaves.  When the salad is unmolded, it makes a nice presentation for a summer dinner party.  Use the best-tasting tomatoes you can find, and good sandwich bread that will absorb the tomato juices and not crumble when cut.  The salad is best made several hours before serving.  For variation, top with a chiffonade of fried leeks, which give a complementary sweet taste and crunch.

                   Nancy's Tuna And Olive Spread - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  black or green olives -- pitted
     1/2           cup  capers in salt -- rinsed well,
                        and drained
  1              small  garlic clove -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           can  tuna packed in olive oil - (6 1/8-oz can)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Fresh lemon juice -- to taste

Combine all the ingredients except the lemon juice in a blender or food processor and process very briefly to make a coarse textured paste.  Taste and add a few drops of lemon juice.

Scoop the ingredients into a bowl and serve with toasted bread or with raw vegetables.

The tuna mixture may be prepared up to a week in advance and refrigerated in a jar with a thin layer of olive oil over the top.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Juicy black and green olives combined with tuna and capers as the topping for crostini is una fantasia (a creation), as Nancy likes to call it.  It's also good as a dip for raw vegetables.  Be sure to use olives in olive oil, not canned.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MADRE (MOTHER DOUGH) ===
     1/2      teaspoon  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm potato water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        === SECOND DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4           cups  warm potato water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  olive oil

In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water and let it proof for five minutes; chalky-looking bubbles will appear on the surface.  Stir in the flour and mix well.  At this point the madre will be the consistency of heavy pancake batter.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the sponge rise for at least 3 hours or even overnight.

When the madre is ready, it should smell yeasty, look fluffy and light, and have a myriad of bubbles appearing on the surface.  The madre is now ready to be combined with the additional yeast, water, flour, olive oil, and salt to make the second dough.

To make the second dough using a fontana, heap 3 1/2 cups of the flour on a work surface.  Add the salt and use your hands to mix the flour and salt together.  Make a hole in the center of the flour with your fist.

Pour the water into the center, add the yeast, and stir with your fingers to dissolve the yeast.  Let the yeast proof as above, then add the madre and the olive oil and mix well with your fingers.  Working in a clockwise fashion, begin bringing flour from the inside of the wall into the yeast mixture with your fingers.

When a rough, shaggy mass of dough is formed, begin to knead the dough, adding additional flour as needed to make a smooth ball of dough that does not stick to your hands.  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, then cover the dough with a towel and let it rest for 5 minutes.  Repeat the kneading and resting 3 more times.  Each time, you will notice that the dough is easier to knead than the previous time.  This is because the flour is gradually absorbing the water in the dough and allowing the gluten in the flour to relax.  The dough should become soft and no longer sticky, and it should move on the work surface with ease.

Spray a large bowl with olive oil spray or coat with butter.  Put the dough in the bowl, turn to coat with the oil or butter, and cover the large bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.

The dough is now ready to be used.  It can also be frozen, which is useful if you want to use only half of the dough.  Spray a heavy-duty plastic bag with vegetable oil spray, put the dough in the bag, squeeze out the air, and seal the bag.  Freeze for up to 3 months.

To make the second dough in a bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water and let proof as directed above.  Stir in the olive oil and the madre.  Using your hands, mix in 3 1/2 cups of the flour, about 1 cup at a time, until a shaggy dough is formed.  Add the salt with the third addition of flour.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and begin kneading, adding additional flour as needed until a smooth ball of dough is created that is no longer sticky.  Follow the directions above for kneading, resting, and rising.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Spray a large bowl with olive oil spray or coat with butter.  Put the dough in the bowl, turn to coat with the oil or butter, and cover the large bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The dough is now ready to be used.  It can also be frozen, which is useful if you want to use only half of the dough.  Spray a heavy-duty plastic bag with vegetable oil spray, put the dough in the bag, squeeze out the air, and seal the bag.  Freeze for up to 3 months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the second dough in a bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water and let proof as directed above.  Stir in the olive oil and the madre.  Using your hands, mix in 3 1/2 cups of the flour, about 1 cup at a time, until a shaggy dough is formed.  Add the salt with the third addition of flour.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and begin kneading, adding additional flour as needed until a smooth ball of dough is created that is no longer sticky.  Follow the directions above for kneading, resting, and rising.

                     Onion Soup - {Zuppa Di Cipolla}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta or salt pork -- diced
  5              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  6               cups  Homemade Beef Broth -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             slices  Italian bread
  2          teaspoons  dry sherry
  8             slices  Swiss, Gruyere, or Provolone cheese -- plus
                        additional cheese grated, if desired

In a large soup pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat, add the pancetta or salt pork, and saute for about 2 minutes.  Add the onions, cover the pot, and cook slowly for about 15 minutes, stirring often, until limp.  Add the broth and grated cheese, stir well, re-cover the pot, and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes.

In a skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil and fry the bread slices on each side until golden brown.  Add additional oil as needed.  Drain the bread on brown paper and set aside.

To serve, ladle the soup into individual ovenproof soup bowls.  Add 1/2 teaspoon sherry to each bowl.  Place a slice of cheese on top of each bowl, then a slice of bread and another slice of cheese.  Sprinkle with additional grated cheese, if desired.  Place the soup bowls under the broiler and broil until the cheese is melted and golden brown.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This rich soup is great for a Friday-night supper.  It can be ready in less than an hour, assuming you have some beef broth in the freezer.  I make it with a combination of beef and veal broth for extra richness.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- diced
  5              large  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  5 1/2           cups  hot beef broth
                        = (fresh or low-sodium canned)
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  4             slices  coarse bread cut 1/2" thick
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

In a large soup pot heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat, add the pancetta and cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the onions, cover the pot and cook slowly for about 15 minutes, stirring often.  When the onions are limp add the lemon juice and allow it to evaporate.

Pour in the broth and wine.  Stir the mixture.  Cover the pot and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Keep the soup warm while you fry the bread.

Preheat the broiler.

Heat the remaining olive oil in a saute pan and brown the bread on both sides.  Drain the slices on paper towels, then place a slice in each of 4 individual soup bowls.  Pour the soup over the bread and divide and sprinkle the cheese over the top.

Broil the soup until the cheese melts.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tuscan cooks are partial to making soups, often favoring them over pasta.  And like pasta, they are a first course or depending on the number of ingredients that go into them, they can serve as a main course.  Bread is often a component in Tuscan soup, either as thickener as in Pappa al Pomodoro or placed in the base of a soup bowl.  In summer I like to make soups on the lighter side, favoring a light tomato soup, but when crisp weather arrives, give me something hearty like this onion soup.  I make it using a variety of onions from my garden but common yellow onions yield a very nice flavor.

                Onions In Vinegar - {Cipolline Sott'Aceto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small white onions -- unpeeled
     2/3           cup  red wine vinegar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried oregano)

Place the onions in a medium saucepan, cover with water, and boil for 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain the onions, let cool, then peel off their skins, leaving them whole.  Place onions in a glass bowl 3 inches deep and about 6 inches wide.

In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt; bring the mixture to a boil.  Stir the ingredients with a wooden spoon and boil for 1 minute, or until the sugar is dissolved.

Pour the vinegar mixture over the onions and add the oregano.  Coat the onions well with the marinade.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let onions marinate at room temperature for several hours.  Shake the bowl often to distribute the marinade.

Serve without liquid as an appetizer or an accompaniment to cold meats such as chicken, turkey, and roast beef.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I love the cipolline, or onions in a vinegar marinade, that are part of the dazzling antipasti choices available at Trattoria del Pennello on Via Dante Alighieri in Florence.  Use small, white onions, no more than 1 inch in diameter.  Serve them as an antipasto, or as an accompaniment to grilled meats or fish.  They will keep for several weeks stored in a glass jar in the refrigerator.

                   Pasta And Beans - {Pasta E Fagioli}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dried borlotti (cranberry) beans
  8               cups  cold water
  2               cups  ditalini - (8 oz)
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  1                     celery rib -- cut into quarters
  2             medium  onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled
  2             ounces  pancetta or bacon
                        Leaves from 2 fresh rosemary sprigs
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  3                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

Place the beans in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and let sit overnight.

The next day, drain the beans, place them in a large soup pot, and cover with cold water.  Bring the beans to a boil and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are still al dente.  Add the pasta and boil the mixture for about 15 minutes more, or until the pasta is al dente.

While the beans are cooking, make a battuto, or minced mixture of the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, pancetta, and rosemary.  In a skillet, heat, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, add the minced mixture, and saute for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften.  Add the tomatoes, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 12 minutes.

When the pasta is cooked, add the vegetable mixture, stirring well.  Add salt and pepper and serve the soup immediately in individual soup bowls.  Drizzle a little of the remaining olive oil over the soup and pass the cheese to sprinkle over the top.

Note:  Crusty Italian bread and a simple green salad of romaine and radicchio round out this meal.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Almost every southern Italian family has a version of pasta and beans, called pasta e fasola, pasta fazool, or pasta e fagioli.  In my version I use the speckled red borlotti, or cranberry bean, although this is a matter of preference since kidney or cannellini beans can also be used.  Italians make this hearty soup with fresh beans when in season.  In the winter, dried beans are first soaked and then cooked.  The pasta used is a small tubular macaroni called ditalini.  Substituting elbow macaroni is acceptable.

Place the beans in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and let sit overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The next day, drain the beans, place them in a large soup pot, and cover with cold water.  Bring the beans to a boil and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are still al dente.  Add the pasta and boil the mixture for about 15 minutes more, or until the pasta is al dente.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the beans are cooking, make a battuto, or minced mixture of the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, pancetta, and rosemary.  In a skillet, heat, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, add the minced mixture, and saute for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften.  Add the tomatoes, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 12 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the pasta is cooked, add the vegetable mixture, stirring well.  Add salt and pepper and serve the soup immediately in individual soup bowls.  Drizzle a little of the remaining olive oil over the soup and pass the cheese to sprinkle over the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Crusty Italian bread and a simple green salad of romaine and radicchio round out this meal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Almost every southern Italian family has a version of pasta and beans, called pasta e fasola, pasta fazool, or pasta e fagioli.  In my version I use the speckled red borlotti, or cranberry bean, although this is a matter of preference since kidney or cannellini beans can also be used.  Italians make this hearty soup with fresh beans when in season.  In the winter, dried beans are first soaked and then cooked.  The pasta used is a small tubular macaroni called ditalini.  Substituting elbow macaroni is acceptable.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  semolina flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  2 1/2           cups  chopped cooked spinach -- well drained
  1                cup  ricotta cheese -- well drained
     2/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1              large  egg -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        === CREMAZOLA SAUCE ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese or cream cheese - (5 oz)
     1/4         pound  Italian Gorgonzola cheese -- crumbled

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the pasta, mix the flours and salt together and mound on a work surface.  Make a well in the center of the flour.  Crack the eggs into the well.  Mix the eggs with your fingers or a fork.  Then begin incorporating the flour from the inside of the well into the eggs, taking care not to break through the sides.  Incorporate just enough of the flour to make a soft but not sticky dough.  Brush away the excess flour and knead the dough until smooth, about 10 minutes.  You may need to add a little warm water if the dough seems too dry or a little flour if it is too wet.  Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest while you make the filling.

To make the filling, spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast them in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Watch them carefully, as they burn easily.  Set aside to cool.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil and saute the onion until soft.  Stir in the prosciutto and pine nuts and cook until the mixture is fairly dry.  Stir in the spinach and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the mixture to a bowl and let cool.  Add the cheeses, egg, salt and pepper, and nutmeg.  Mix well.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

On a well-floured surface, roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a large round about 22 inches in diameter.  The dough should be very thin -- no thicker than a sheet of typing paper.

Spread the filling evenly over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edges.  Roll up the dough like a jelly roll.  Pinch the seam to seal it and to prevent the filling from coming out.  Place the roll along a long edge of a large clean kitchen towel, roll the pasta up in a towel, and tie the ends of the towel with string.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Carefully lower the towel-encased pasta roll into the water, bending it gently to fit.  When the water returns to the boil, partially cover the pot and poach the roll for 20 minutes.  Remove the roll carefully with 2 spatulas, place it on a baking sheet, and let it cool.

Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.

Untie and unwrap the towel and carefully transfer the roll to a cutting board.  Cut the roll into 1-inch lengths and lay them on their sides in the baking dish in a single layer.

In a saucepan, combine all the sauce ingredients and bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Lower the heat to medium and stir the mixture until smooth.  Pour half the sauce over the rolls.  Bake, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pasta rolls are hot and the sauce is bubbling.

Reheat the remaining sauce to pass at the table, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  While most professional chefs in Italy are men, the one area that remains the domain of women is pasta fatta a mano, pasta made by hand.  In most Italian restaurant kitchens, it is the women who produce the thinnest, sometimes almost translucent, sheets of pasta with only several forceful passes of the rolling pin -- it takes me quite a bit longer.  The matterello, or rolling pin, is thin and about two feet long, and the pasta dough yields in elastic submission to its sturdy shaping.  My friend Maria, who makes all the pasta for Tre Vaselle in Torgiano, loves my version of a hand-rolled and stuffed pasta, which is first poached and then baked.  I serve this spectacular dish as a first course or as a main course.  You can make the filling and sauce a day ahead and refrigerate them until ready to use.

Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/4         pound  ground beef chuck
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves - (scant)
  2             quarts  chicken broth
                        = (homemade or canned low sodium)
     1/2           cup  pastina
                        = (or other small soup pasta such as
                        stelline or orzo)

Combine the bread crumbs and milk in a small bowl and set aside.  In a medium-size bowl, mix the chuck, cheese, lemon zest, salt, and cloves just enough to combine the ingredients.  Gently mix in the bread-crumb-and-milk mixture.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Form tiny meatballs using about 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture and roll each ball between the palms of your hands.  To keep your hands from sticking, dip them in water occasionally.

Place the meatballs in an 8-inch baking pan or dish; bake them for 6 to 8 minutes, then remove them form the pan with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper-towel-lined dish to drain.

Meanwhile, bring the chicken broth to a boil in a pot.  Stir in the pastina and cook until al dent, 10 to 12 minutes.  Stir in the meatballs, lower the heat to medium, and cook about 3 minutes longer.  Serve immediately with additional grated cheese if desired.

Note:  The meatballs can be made and frozen after cooking for future use.  They'll keep for several months.  Other broths, such as beef, veal, and vegetable, can also be used.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Baking the meatballs instead of frying them keeps them light and tender, and eliminates adding any additional fat.  Having chicken broth on hand makes this a soup that can be ready in no time.

                 Pear, Walnut And Gorgonzola Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  mixed salad greens -- washed, and
                        spun or patted dry
  2                     pears -- peeled and sliced
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- toasted, if desired
     1/4           cup  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  confectioner's sugar
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar
     1/2           cup  canola oil

Put the greens, pears, walnuts, and cheese into a salad bowl large enough for tossing.

Mix the first four dressing ingredients together in a bowl.  Using a hand mixer on high speed or a wire whisk, slowly drizzle the oil into the dressing until it is the consistency of honey.  Pour the dressing over the salad and mix gently.  Serve immediately.

Note:  To keep the peeled pears from turning brown, slice them into a small bowl with water that has a tablespoon or two of lemon juice or vinegar added to it.  Dry the slices just before use.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a wonderful salad to prepare when fresh pears are at their peak.  To enhance the flavor of the walnuts, you may toast them on an oiled cookie sheet for 5 minutes at 350 degrees.  The dressing can be made with the oil of your preference, but I like the flavor of canola oil when it is combined with the other ingredients.

Mix the first four dressing ingredients together in a bowl.  Using a hand mixer on high speed or a wire whisk, slowly drizzle the oil into the dressing until it is the consistency of honey.  Pour the dressing over the salad and mix gently.  Serve immediately.

Note:  To keep the peeled pears from turning brown, slice them into a small bowl with water that has a tablespoon or two of lemon juice or vinegar added to it.  Dry the slices just before use.

Comments:  This is a wonderful salad to prepare when fresh pears are at their peak.  To enhance the flavor of the walnuts, you may toast them on an oiled cookie sheet for 5 minutes at 350 degrees.  The dressing can be made with the oil of your preference, but I like the flavor of canola oil when it is combined with the other ingredients.

            Pecorino Cheese And Fava Beans - {Pecorino E Fave}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  aged Pecorino cheese -- room temperature
  3             pounds  shelled fava beans
                        Fine sea salt -- (optional)

Put the cheese on a cheese board and the fava beans in a bowl.  Have a small bowl of salt.  Cut off bite-size pieces of cheese with a cheese knife and eat it with the fava beans, dipping them first in salt if you wish.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  All cheese is best eaten at room temperature and one of the ways Tuscans enjoy Pecorino cheese is as an antipasto with fresh shelled fava beans and a glass of wine.  When the beans are young and tender, they need no cooking and can be eaten raw.  If they are large, boil them until the outer skin easily slips off.

              Pecorino Cheese And Olive Oil Antipasto - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  aged Pecorino cheese -- cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  diced pitted black oil-cured olives

In a bowl combine the cheese, olive oil, pepper, and oregano and toss with a spoon to coat the cheese well.  Stir in the olives.  Cover the bowl and allow the cheese to marinate for at least 2 hours at room temperature before serving as part of an antipasto with good crusty bread.

Variation:  Diced red sweet peppers and thin slivers of fennel also make a nice combination.

Tip:  Did you know that hard cheese will grate much more easily if allowed to come to room temperature first?

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you have aged Pecorino cheese in the refrigerator, this antipasto can be made in no time.  Pecorino is made exclusively from sheep's milk; it is salted and aged.  Some varieties are studded with green or black peppercorns.  You may be familiar with Pecorino Romano, which simply means sheep's milk cheese from the region of Lazio, which includes Rome, but Pecorino is also a specialty cheese of other regions of Italy, including Tuscany, Sicily, and Sardinia.  In this antipasto, the cheese is cubed and marinated in extra-virgin olive oil with oregano.  No additional salt is used in the recipe because the cheese is salty enough.  A variation is to add oil-cured black olives.  Serve it with slices of crusty bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  aged Pecorino cheese with black or green
                        peppercorns
                        Dried red pepper flakes -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

Cut the cheese into small cubes and put them into 8- or 12-ounce jars.  Sprinkle a few red pepper flakes in the jar.  Fill the jars with the oil, making sure to cover the cheese completely.  Cap and refrigerate.  To use, bring the jars to room temperature.  Serve the cheese with some of the oil along with bread.

The cheese will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator.  Be sure any remaining cheese is covered with oil before placing it back in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 1 pound.

Comments:  Silvia knew her cheeses as well as her wines, and in Tuscany it is all about Pecorino Toscano, sheep's milk cheese made from ewe's milk between September and June.  Pecorino Toscano is a table and grating cheese.  When young it is soft and mild tasting, but as it ages it hardens and develops a drier texture and a more pronounced taste.  Pienze, a wonderful Renaissance town near the wine area of Montalcino, and home to Pope Pius 11 was partially designed by Bernardo Rossellino and is known for its Pecorino cheese, which was also a favorite of Michelangelo.  Pecorino with peppercorns is also a favorite of mine and I like to give it marinated in olive oil as a gift from my kitchen.  Serve it with crusty Tuscan bread and drizzle some of the oil from the cheese jar over the bread.  Add a few olives and you have a simple antipasto.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  pine nuts or walnuts
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  coarse sea salt
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Pecorino or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast them for 4 to 5 minutes, until they are golden brown.  Transfer the nuts to a bowl to cool.

Bring the water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the basil leaves, and blanch them for 1 minute.  Remove the leaves with a slotted spoon to a clean kitchen towel.  Blot the leaves dry, then trans≠fer them to the bowl of a food processor or blender with the salt and garlic cloves.  Pulse the mixture to grind up the ingredients.  Add the pine nuts and pulse again until a uniform coarse mixture is ob≠tained.

With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil through the feed tube until a sauce consis≠tency is obtained that is not too thin.  Remove the pesto to a small bowl and stir in the cheese.  Transfer the sauce to a jar.  Pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top of the sauce.  This will keep the sauce from turning brown.  Cap the jar and store the sauce in the refrigerator until ready to use.  The sauce will keep about 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields about 3/4 cup.

Comments:  This classic Genovese pesto sauce is made from fresh basil leaves that are crushed in a mortar with a pestle.  To save time, use a food processor.  Blanch the basil leaves before grinding them to help preserve the sauce's green color.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
  1              pound  butter -- softened
     3/4         pound  cream cheese -- softened
     1/4         pound  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
                        A few fresh basil leaves
     3/4           cup  Pesto Sauce -- (see recipe)
  24            slices  Italian bread, 1" thick
                        = (from a narrow baguette-type loaf)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast them until lightly golden, about 5 minutes; be careful not to burn them.  Let cool.

In a food processor, or in a bowl, combine the butter, cream cheese, and mascarpone cheese.  Process, or beat with a wooden spoon, until very smooth.  Set aside.

Line a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan or a 6-cup round mold with a double thickness of damp cheesecloth large enough to hang over the sides of the mold.  Scatter some of the pine nuts in the bottom of the mold and arrange the basil leaves, shiny-side down, to make an attractive design.

Spoon one third of the cheese mixture into the mold and smooth it to make an even layer.  Carefully spoon half of the pesto sauce on top of the cheese layer and sprinkle with the remaining pine nuts.  Add another layer of the cheese mixture, spoon the remaining pesto sauce over it, and top with the remainder of the cheese mixture.  Bring the cheesecloth edges up over the top of the mold.  Press lightly on the top of the mold to settle the ingredients.  Cover the mold with foil and refrigerate for several hours, or up to 3 days.

To serve, remove the foil and turn the mold upside down onto a serving dish.  Remove the cheesecloth; let the torta come to room temperature.

In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil and fry the bread slices a few at a time until golden brown on both sides, adding more olive oil as needed.  Place the bread around the base of the torta, and cut it into slices or wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Pesto is the classic sauce from Genoa made from pungent basil leaves.  The Genovese remove not only the stems but also the center vein of each leaf when making this sauce.  Pesto is especially delicious in this torta, which can be prepared up to three days ahead.

                        Poor Soup - {Zuppa Povera}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  long-grain rice
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  beef marrow or olive oil
  2                     celery ribs -- sliced thin
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  2 1/2           cups  fresh spinach - (4 oz) -- washed, and
                        torn into pieces
  1              pound  very ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  2               cups  hot chicken broth
  2               cups  hot water
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  4              large  eggs - (to 6)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley

In a medium pot, boil the rice in the water until rice is cooked, about 10 minutes.  Set aside.

In a medium soup pot, heat the beef marrow or olive oil until hot.  Add the celery and onion, and saute the vegetables until soft.  Add the spinach and cook until wilted.  Add the tomatoes, stirring the mixture for a few minutes, then add the hot broth, hot water, and tomato paste.  Stir to dissolve the paste, then add the salt, pepper, and rice.  Cover the pot and let the soup cook gently for about 5 minutes.

Raise the heat and bring the soup to a boil.  Gently crack each egg into the soup, spacing them so they do not touch.  Gently boil the soup until the eggs are set.  Sprinkle on the parsley.  Serve the soup immediately, allowing 1 egg per person.

Note:  I sprinkle grated Pecorino Romano cheese on top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Not only was my grandmother Galasso a good cook, but she was also a shrewd businesswoman.  The house I grew up in belonged to her.  To make ends meet for her large family of eight children, she rented out the bathtub, the only one in the neighborhood, on Saturday nights for five cents a person.  She also rented rooms and provided simple meals for factory workers.  This soup, which is inexpensive to make and very nourishing, was served to many a boarder in my grandmother's kitchen.

                 Prosciutto Roll - {Rotolo Al Prosciutto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/3           cups  milk
  4              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  prosciutto -- thinly sliced

Grease a 17- by 11-inch jellyroll pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Use 2 tablespoons of the butter to grease 2 sheets of parchment paper, cut to fit the pan.  Place one sheet in the pan.  Set the other aside.

In a small bowl, beat together the remaining butter with the flour to form a uniform paste.

In a saucepan, scald the milk, add the butter mixture, and whisk it into the milk; whisk continually over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and smooth.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the egg yolks, one at a time, whisking each completely before adding another.  Whisk in the parsley, nutmeg, and salt.  Place the saucepan in a bowl of ice cubes and stir the mixture until it is cold.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff, then gently fold them into the egg mixture with a spatula.  Carefully spread the batter evenly in the jellyroll pan.  Bake for about 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.

Remove the pan from the oven and carefully turn it upside down onto the remaining sheet of buttered parchment paper, placed over a clean towel.  Carefully remove the top piece of parchment paper and discard.  Arrange the prosciutto slices evenly over the top of the dough.  Starting at the shortest end, roll the dough up like a jellyroll, using the parchment paper as a guide for rolling.  Let the rotolo rest for about 15 minutes, wrapped in the parchment paper.

Unwrap the rotolo and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  Arrange the slices on an attractive serving dish.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A rotolo di pasta is a sheet of pasta dough, spread with a filling like spinach and then rolled up like a jellyroll.  It is boiled, baked, and then served as an appetizer.  In this antipasto version, the rotolo resembles an airy omelet.  Cut into slices, it is an elegant start to any meal.

Parchment paper, available in housewares stores, makes it easy to roll up the dough.

                   Pugliese Hard Biscuits - {Frisedde}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt

In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir to dissolve.  Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes, until it swells and becomes bubbly.

Gradually add 2 3/4 cups flour and the salt to the yeast mixture and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed, adding additional flour as needed until the dough is no longer sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5 minutes, or until smooth.

Lightly oil a large bowl with olive oil.  Place the dough in it, and turn to coat.  Cover with a towel and let rest for about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease two baking sheets.

On a floured surface, knead the dough for a few minutes.  Roll it into a 24-inch rope and cut the rope into six pieces.  Roll each piece into a 13-inch rope and bring the ends together to form a ring.  Pinch the ends to seal.  Place 3 rings on each baking sheet, spacing them well apart.  Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.

Bake the rings for 10 minutes.  Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the rings cool slightly.  (Leave the oven on.)  With a sharp knife, cut the rings horizontally in half, and place on the baking sheets, cut-sides up.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the rings to a rack to cool completely.

To serve, dip each ring quickly in water and place on individual serving dishes.  Fill the centers with your choice of ingredients.

Note:  Any leftover rings can be frozen, well wrapped, for future use.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Frisedda, a hard, dry biscuit from Puglia, was originally eaten by shepherds while tending their flocks.  It provided a welcome snack that kept well for a long time.  There are many ways to use it; my favorite is as the base of a fresh tomato salad.  Traditionally, frisedde are boiled first, then baked, split in half, and baked again until dry and hard; in this modern version, the boiling step is eliminated.  The frisedde are topped with anything from diced plum tomatoes and herbs to marinated vegetables to a seafood salad of squid, shrimp, and clams.

Roll each piece into a 13-inch rope and bring the ends together to form a ring.  Pinch the ends to seal.  Place 3 rings on each baking sheet, spacing them well apart.  Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the rings for 10 minutes.  Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the rings cool slightly.  (Leave the oven on.)  With a sharp knife, cut the rings horizontally in half, and place on the baking sheets, cut-sides up.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the rings to a rack to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, dip each ring quickly in water and place on individual serving dishes.  Fill the centers with your choice of ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Any leftover rings can be frozen, well wrapped, for future use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Frisedda, a hard, dry biscuit from Puglia, was originally eaten by shepherds while tending their flocks.  It provided a welcome snack that kept well for a long time.  There are many ways to use it; my favorite is as the base of a fresh tomato salad.  Traditionally, frisedde are boiled first, then baked, split in half, and baked again until dry and hard; in this modern version, the boiling step is eliminated.  The frisedde are topped with anything from diced plum tomatoes and herbs to marinated vegetables to a seafood salad of squid, shrimp, and clams.

         Pumpkin Soup Al Mascaron - {Zuppa Di Succa Al Mascaron}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  acorn squash -- quartered and seeded
  1 1/2         pounds  butternut squash -- quartered and seeded
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2         pound  leeks - (abt 2) -- washed, leaves
                        trimmed and bulb thinly sliced
  2               cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  nonfat half-and-half or light cream
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
  2             ounces  radicchio -- thinly shredded

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the squash quarters in a 15 1/2- by 10 1/4-inch pan.  Add the water, cover the pan with aluminum foil, and bake the squash for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until soft.  When cool, scoop out the flesh and place it in a food processor.  Discard the skins.

In a soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat, then add the leeks and cook slowly over low heat just until the leeks are limp.  Stir in 3 tablespoons of the chicken broth and continue cooking until the leeks are very soft.  Transfer the leeks to the food processor with the squash and puree the mixture until it is blended.  Slowly pour the broth through the feed tube with the motor running and process until the mixture is very smooth.

Transfer the soup to the soup pot.  Stir in the half-and-half or cream, nutmeg, and salt.  Heat the mixture slowly until hot.  Ladle the soup into individual bowls and top with some of the shredded radicchio.  Serve immediately.

Tip:  To save time, cook and puree the squash several days ahead.  Squash can be frozen for future use.

Note:  Did you know that radicchio is a member of the chicory family?  This dark-magenta-colored lettuce with white veining and a slightly bitter taste comes from the Veneto region and is a favorite with Venetians, who use it not only raw in salads but also grilled with olive oil, stirred into risotto, steamed, and shredded as a garnish for fish, vegetables, and soups.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts.

Comments:  Venice is an amphibious city with its grand palazzi seemingly suspended on water and whose aura of opulence evokes magic and mystery.  The food of Venice brings me down to earth; it is honest and homey if you know where to look, and it won't be in piazza San Marco where a sea of tourists congregate to marvel at the mosaic encrusted faÁade of San Marco or the Campanile (bell tower).  No, the best food of Venice is found along the narrow streets in the small hidden neighborhoods called campi.  One such place is al Mascaron Osteria on calle Longa Santa Maria Formosa 5225.  The decor is rustic, with wooden tables and chairs that lend family-like atmosphere and the clientele is strictly local -- no English spoken here.  So be prepared to practice your Italian while anticipating the arrival of true Venetian food.  An outstanding dish is the zuppa di succa, smooth and creamy pumpkin soup with just a hint of freshly grated nutmeg that is served with a delicate shredding of cheery radicchio over the top.  I have re-created the dish using a combination of acorn squash and butternut squash, which best approximates the taste of this wonderful soup.  Succa is the Venetian dialect word for zucca (pumpkin).

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  chunk pancetta -- diced
  1              large  onion -- peeled and diced
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2         pound  radicchio - (2 small heads) -- washed, drained,
                        and torn into pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Cook the pancetta without any additional fat in a saute pan set over medium heat until it is crisp.  Drain the pancetta on brown paper and set it aside.

Wipe out the saute pan with a paper towel.  Add the onion and the balsamic vinegar and cook over medium heat until the vinegar has evaporated.  Stir the onion once or twice during the cooking.  Transfer the onion to a dish and set it aside.

Put the radicchio in a salad bowl and mix in the pancetta and the onions.  Toss the mixture with the salt, then with the olive oil.

Use a vegetable peeler to make long, thin shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on top of the salad.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Outside the main gate to Ravenna's old city center is an inviting little restaurant called Trattoria Chilo.  My husband Guy and I dined there outside on the patio surrounded by brick walls and climbing plants.  The owner, Rita Pezzi, is a vivacious person who gives cooking lessons in her spare time.  She is lots of fun to talk to about Emilian cuisine.  Our first course was cappellacci, fresh pasta stuffed with a mixture of fragrant herbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  After that we were offered un'assaggio, a tasting of paper-thin lasagne sheets with a mixture of vegetables nestled between them, and a plate of grilled vegetables, including the elongated radicchio di Treviso.  After all that, Guy was still hungry, so he ordered rabbit cooked with grapes, lemon, and parsley.  I opted for a refreshing radicchio salad that was flavored with fried bits of pancetta (Italian bacon) and onions that had been cooked in a young balsamic vinegar.  I was glad I did!

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  romaine lettuce leaves -- washed, dried,
                        and torn into pieces
  6              large  radishes -- washed, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  diced zucchini
  1 1/2           cups  fresh raspberries
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  warm honey

In a medium bowl combine the lettuce, radishes, zucchini, and raspberries.  Set aside.

In a smaller bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and honey until the dressing is well blended.  Pour mixture over the vegetables and raspberries and toss gently.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When I serve this salad, friends give me a quizzical look as if to say, "Is that Italian?"  And the answer is yes, especially since I first enjoyed it in Valeggio.  The combination of radishes, raspberries, and zucchini is delightful and colorful, and a real palate cleanser after fish or a spicy dinner.  Use a salad spinner or towel to thoroughly dry the lettuce leaves.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  plum tomatoes -- diced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2                     basil leaves -- minced
  3             sprigs  flat-leaf Italian parsley -- minced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  8              small  toasted bread slices

Mix the tomatoes, garlic, basil, parsley, olive oil, and salt in a bowl.  Allow the mixture to marinate for several hours at room temperature.

Place two slices of bread on each of 4 salad plates.  Divide and top the bread with the tomato mixture and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I love the way Nancy describes the little toasts (crostini) that she likes to make: Crostini Rossi and Crostini Neri, that form the beginning to a Tuscan meal.  Crostini rossi can only mean a tomato salad topping for Tuscan bread and the best is made with summer-ripe plum tomatoes.

Comments:  I love the way Nancy describes the little toasts (crostini) that she likes to make: Crostini Rossi and Crostini Neri, that form the beginning to a Tuscan meal.  Crostini rossi can only mean a tomato salad topping for Tuscan bread and the best is made with summer-ripe plum tomatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1 1/3           cups  ricotta cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  butter

In a bowl with a wire whisk, beat the eggs and grated cheese until fluffy.  Add the ricotta, parsley, salt, and pepper and whisk until the mixture is smooth.  Set aside.

In a 12-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter until hot.  Pour in the egg mixture and cook over medium heat until the bottom of the frittata starts to set.

Lift the edges of the frittata with a spatula and let the uncooked top mixture run underneath.  Continue cooking until the top is not runny.

Place a flat dish or round pizza pan larger then the skillet over the top and invert the frittata onto it.  Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet.  Slide the frittata back into the skillet and cook the remaining side until set.  Turn it out onto a serving dish and serve immediately, cut into wedges.

Note:  This recipe can by varied by adding different herbs and is also an excellent way to use up small amounts of leftover veggies that might be in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Many times I watched my grandmother Galasso take a scoop of fresh ricotta and fry it in olive oil and butter.  When it was a light golden brown, she sprinkled black pepper and a little salt over it, and it became lunch with a piece of homemade bread.  I make a frittata with eggs and cheese.

Arrange the lemon and orange slices around the edges of the platter, overlapping them slightly.  Cover the platter tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours before serving.  (Or refrigerate for longer, but bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

        Salad With Four Cheeses - {Insalata Con Quattro Formaggi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  Taleggio cheese -- cut into thin strips
                        = (or Fontina cheese)
     1/4         pound  aged Pecorino cheese -- grated
     1/4         pound  Swiss cheese -- grated
     1/4         pound  young Pecorino -- cut into thin strips
                        = (or Provolone)
                        Grinding of black pepper
  3               cups  mixed lettuce greens -- washed, dried,
                        and cut into thin strips
  1 1/2    tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brush an 11- by 8-inch Pyrex baking dish with one teaspoon of the olive oil.  Layer the cheeses in the dish in the order given.  Drizzle one teaspoon of the olive oil over the top of the cheeses and give it a grinding of black pepper.

Cover the dish with a sheet of aluminum foil and place the dish in the oven to melt the cheese; this should take no more than 5 minutes.

Meanwhile toss the greens in a salad bowl with the remaining olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Add a pinch of salt if you wish, but remember there is salt in the cheeses.

Transfer the greens to a platter.  Scoop the cheese carefully out of the baking dish and place it on top of the salad.  Serve at once.

Variation:  Add thin slices of black olives between the layers of cheese before putting the dish in the oven.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This intriguing salad made with four cheeses melted over Gioni's greens picked from his country garden was so fabulous that I had a second helping.  It is a perfect example of Iris' ingenuity in the kitchen.  She uses two types of Pecorino cheese, one aged and one young, along with Taleggio, a square creamy cheese from Lombardy that is high in fat.  If you cannot find Taleggio, use Fontina, and for the young Pecorino, you may substitute Provolone.

                Salted Pizza Bites - {Crescentine Salate}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian
                Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary needles
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
  4               cups  vegetable oil
                        Coarse sea salt -- for sprinkling

Mix the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl.  Work in the butter and rosemary, then add the wine a little at a time until a soft ball of dough is formed.  Roll the dough into a 12- by 11-inch rectangle, then trim the piece to 10 by 10 inches.  Cut 2-inch squares.  Reroll the scraps to make more.

Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy-duty pot until a thermometer registers 375 degrees.  Fry the crescentine in the oil until golden brown.  Remove them with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.  Sprinkle the crescentine with salt and serve warm.

Variation:  Use a combination of herbs or add 1/2 cup of minced prosciutto to the dough.

This recipe yields at least 3 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Not everything at Nannini's is sweet; there are savory offerings too, like mini vegetable and cheese tarts, sandwiches with every type of meat and cheese or vegetable filling imaginable, and crescentine, small pizza-like bread studded with flecks of rosemary that are deep fried.  They make a great snack or an antipasto served with olives and chips of pecorino cheese.  The dough is easy to make in a food processor or by hand.  Crescentine are best served warm the day they are made.

Mix the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl.  Work in the butter and rosemary, then add the wine a little at a time until a soft ball of dough is formed.  Roll the dough into a 12- by 11-inch rectangle, then trim the piece to 10 by 10 inches.  Cut 2-inch squares.  Reroll the scraps to make more.

<DirT>
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy-duty pot until a thermometer registers 375 degrees.  Fry the crescentine in the oil until golden brown.  Remove them with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.  Sprinkle the crescentine with salt and serve warm.

Variation:  Use a combination of herbs or add 1/2 cup of minced prosciutto to the dough.

This recipe yields at least 3 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Not everything at Nannini&apos;s is sweet; there are savory offerings too, like mini vegetable and cheese tarts, sandwiches with every type of meat and cheese or vegetable filling imaginable, and crescentine, small pizza-like bread studded with flecks of rosemary that are deep fried.  They make a great snack or an antipasto served with olives and chips of pecorino cheese.  The dough is easy to make in a food processor or by hand.  Crescentine are best served warm the day they are made.

            Sardinian Fish Soup - {Zuppa Di Pesce Alla Sarda}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads
     1/2           cup  hot chicken broth
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced onion
     1/2           cup  chopped fennel bulb -- plus
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fennel leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped peeled fresh or
                        canned plum tomatoes
                        = (about 3 medium tomatoes)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2 1/2         pounds  mixed seafood
                        = (cleaned squid, lobster meat, tuna and
                        swordfish steaks)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             slices  Italian bread -- toasted
                        Grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Soak the saffron threads in the hot chicken broth; set aside.

In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat the oil.  Add the onion and saute for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped fennel bulb and saute for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute.  Add the fennel leaves, parsley, tomatoes, and wine and stir well.  Strain the chicken broth, pressing on the saffron threads to extract all the liquid, and add to the pot; discard the saffron.  Stir well and simmer for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut the squid into 1/2-inch rings.  Cut the lobster, tuna, and swordfish into 1-inch cubes.

Add the squid to the pot and season with salt and pepper.  Cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the squid is barely al dente, still firm but not rubbery.  Add the remaining seafood and cook for 10 minutes longer.

Place a bread slice in each of 6 soup bowls and carefully ladle the soup over the bread.  Pass grated Pecorino Romano cheese at the table.

Note:  It is not customary in Italy to put grated cheese on fish dishes, but here the salty taste nicely complements the flavors of the seafood.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Some people aren't aware that the island of Sardinia is part of Italy.  Its cooking is rooted deep in history and the best way to describe its cuisine is just to call it simple -- taking the offerings from the land and sea and using them in unadulterated ways.  One example is the preparation of many fish dishes.  Sardinian waters have a great variety of seafood, including bass, mullet, eel, tuna, spiny lobster, laguna fish, trout, and cuttlefish.  While it is impossible to duplicate a Sardinian fish stew exactly, I substitute whatever is available here and it still sings to me of Sardegna.  A mix of four different types of seafood is a good rule to follow for this dish.

              Seafood Salad - {Insalata Dei Frutti Di Mare}

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
                        Juice of 2 to 3 lemons -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled and crushed
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/3           cup  chopped fennel leaves
     1/2           cup  diced red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt -- or to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SEAFOOD ===
  2             pounds  small squid
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
  1              pound  bay scallops

In a shallow nonmetal dish, combine all the marinade ingredients.  Mix well and set aside.

Remove the head of each squid by pulling it away from the body.  Cut off the tentacles below the eyes and discard the head.  Pull out the membranes from the interior cavity of each squid body, and remove the plasticlike spine bone from the inside of the squid.  Pull off the tough outer skin.  Wash the squid bodies and tentacles thoroughly in cold water.  Cut the bodies into 1/4-inch rings and dice the tentacles.  Set aside.

In a 2-quart saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.  Add the coarse salt and shrimp, and boil until the shrimp turn pink, about 3 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp and let cool.  Add the scallops to the boiling water and boil for 3 minutes.  Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and let cool.  Add the squid rings to the boiling water and boil until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  About 5 minutes before the rings are cooked, add the diced tentacles.  The squid should be firm but not chewy; drain well.

Add the squid, shrimp, and scallops to the marinade and toss well.  Adjust the seasoning if necessary.  Cover and let marinate for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator, turning the mixture frequently.

Transfer the salad to a serving platter and let come to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Squid are very delicate if prepared right and can be stuffed and baked, fried, or used in combination with other fish for a light marinated fish salad.  A successful squid salad depends on two things: The size of the squid (they should be small for this dish) and the cooking time (do not overcook them).

                        Juice of two large lemons
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/3           cup  minced fresh mint leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse black pepper
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Combine the leaves with the water and honey in a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer the mixture, uncovered, until reduced by half.  Strain the mixture through a sieve into a bowl.  Add salt to taste.  Set aside and keep the sauce warm.

With a knife, score the lamb chops on both sides.  Set aside.

In a shallow dish large enough to hold the lamb chops in a single layer, mix together the garlic, lemon juice, honey, mint, pepper, and olive oil.  Place the chops in the marinade and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but overnight is better.  Turn the chops over once or twice while they are marinating.

Prepare a gas or charcoal grill, or pre-heat the oven broiler.

Drain the chops from the marinade and grill or broil them about 5 minutes.  Serve with mint sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My husband Guy loves this preparation for blade cut shoulder lamb chops.  He says they are tastier than their high-cost cousins, center cut lamb chops.  Try this the next time you grill outdoors, or oven-broil them.

                 Shrimp Cocktail - {Cocktail Di Gamberi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  brandy
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  diced fresh pineapple
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp - (30 per lb) -- cooked
  1               head  romaine lettuce
  1              small  radicchio head
  1              large  orange -- sliced in thin
                        wedges
  1              large  lemon -- sliced in thin
                        wedges

Mix the mayonnaise, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and brandy.  Add the cream, pepper, and pineapple and fold in.  Reserve and refrigerate half the sauce.  Mix the remaining sauce with the shrimp, folding in carefully.  Cover the shrimp and marinate in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

Cut the romaine lettuce into thin shreds.  Tear the radicchio into bite-size pieces.

Half-fill 4 to 6 fruit-cup glasses or wide-mouth goblets with some of the romaine and radicchio.  With a spoon, divide the shrimp among the glasses and garnish each with a wedge of lemon and orange.  Serve as a first course; pass the reserved sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  One night while attending a cooking school in Sorrento, our chef Lorenzo prepared an antipasto table that consisted of over thirty-five dishes!  One of my favorites was this Cocktail di Gamberi.  What surprised me about the sauce was so many ingredients I thought were strictly in the American culinary domain.

This is a wonderful and simple presentation for a dinner party.  The ingredients can be doubled successfully.  The original recipe called for canned pineapple, for which I can find no culinary use.  Fresh pineapple is far superior.

                  Shrimp Soup With Orzo And Farro - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  orzo
                        = (or small dried white beans)
     1/2           cup  farro
  2 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     celery stalks -- thinly sliced
  1              small  onion -- minced
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  4               cups  hot chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  celery salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  small cooked shrimp

Pour the orzo into a saucepan and cover with 3 cups of cold water.  Bring to a boil and cook about 15 to 20 minutes, just until al dente, firm but cooked.  (If you are using beans, soak them overnight, then cook them about 30 minutes, or until tender but not mushy.)  Drain and set aside.

Soak the farro overnight, drain, and transfer it to the saucepan used to cook the orzo.  Cover the farro with 3 cups of cold water and bring to a boil.  Cook about 25 minutes, or just until the grains are cooked through but still remain firm.  Drain and set aside.

Place the tomatoes in a food processor, food mill, or blender and puree until smooth.  Pour the pulp into a fine-mesh strainer placed over a bowl.  Press on the pulp with a spoon to release its juice.  Discard the seeds and skins.  There should be about 2 cups of tomato juice.  If not, add water.  Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan and stir in the celery, onion, and parsley.  Cook until the vegetables soften.  Pour in the chicken broth, reserved tomato juice, celery salt, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes.  Stir in the orzo and farro.  Stir in the shrimp.  Cook over low heat for 3 or 4 minutes; do not let the soup boil or the shrimp will become tough.

Ladle the soup into bowls and pass olive oil to drizzle on top.

Variation:  Add small broccoli florets to the soup.

Note:  If you cannot find small shrimp, buy the 20/40 count and cut them in half lengthwise.

This recipe yields 1 3/4 quarts.

Comments:  This soup is another of Salvatore Denaro's signature dishes in the enoteca.  I find the tiny shrimp swimming in a tomato-based broth different, delicious, and filling.  Though this soup takes time to prepare, it can be considered a meal in itself.  I have adapted the recipe by using orzo in place of the risina.  Tiny dried white beans can also be substituted.  Farro packs this soup with both flavor and nutrition.  Soak the farro the day before and cook the orzo or beans ahead to cut down on the cooking time.

                Sicilian Sardine And Cheese Sandwich - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sesame seed baguette - (12" to 14" long) -- halved lengthwise
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper - (to 1/2)
  6                     salted sardines - (to 7) -- cut small pieces

Drizzle the olive oil evenly over one half of the bread.  Set aside.

In a small bowl combine the cheese and the pepper.  Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the olive oil.  Top the cheese mixture with the sardines.

Place the second half of the baguette on top of the sardines.  Use a sharp knife and cut the baguette into 4 equal pieces.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "Please e-mail me a quick idea for a Sicilian-type sandwich."  I get this kind of request all the time.  Here is a very authentic Sicilian sandwich that was made for me at Al Forno panificio in Vallelunga.  Use a good thin baguette with a sesame seed crust, if possible.  This is one of those instances where fish and cheese together do complement each other.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  curly chicory or romaine lettuce -- washed, dried,
                        and torn into pieces
  1              large  orange -- peeled, sectioned,
                        and cut into small pieces
  1                     grapefruit -- peeled, sectioned,
                        and cut into small pieces
  1                     pomegranate -- seeds only
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice of 1 medium orange
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Comments:  This eye- as well as palate-pleasing citrus and lettuce salad takes its inspiration from Sicily.  Crisp lettuce leaves are combined with tart pomegranate seeds and orange and grapefruit sections, all tossed in a dressing of fruity extra-virgin olive oil and orange juice.

                 Soup For The Lombards - {Zuppa Lombarda}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried cannellini, white kidney or
                        Great Northern beans
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  6                     fresh sage leaves - (to 8) -- torn into pieces
  2                     plum tomatoes -- diced
                        Reserved bean cooking water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  6             slices  toasted bread - (to 8)

Soak the beans overnight; drain them, put them in a pot, cover with 6 cups of cold water and cook them for 20 minutes.  Set them aside but do not drain them.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the olive oil in a Dutch-oven-type pot or other ovenproof pot.  Stir in the garlic and sage and cook until the garlic softens.  Stir in the tomatoes and cook for a couple of minutes.  Add the beans, with their cooking water, and additional water to cover the beans if necessary.

Cover the pot and bake the soup until the beans are tender, about 1 hour.  Add the salt and pepper.  Place a slice of bread in each individual soup bowl and ladle the soup over the bread.  Pass olive oil to drizzle on top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  According to Iris, this soup was created for Lombard mercenary soldiers descending from Milan into Florence.  They took up residence in osterie, inns, offering food and lodging.  The innkeepers, surprised by the numbers of them placated their hunger by making a soup from some dried beans, stale bread and herbs.  Ever frugal, they even used the water that the beans cooked in as the broth.  I have experimented with this soup allowing the beans to soak overnight and then briefly boiling them before finishing the soup in the oven.  Done this way, the beans are creamy and smooth and the broth a surprisingly "rich" color.

          Soup With Bread Under It - {Minestra Con Panno Sotto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  8               cups  chopped fresh or canned plum tomatoes - -- (abt 5 lbs)
  2             sprigs  basil - (to 3)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- leaves trimmed and
                        cut crosswise into 3 or 4 pieces
  1                     loaf Italian bread -- cut into 1" slices
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese -- more or less

In a large pot, heat the olive oil.  Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute until the garlic is soft.  Add the tomatoes, basil, and salt and pepper.  Stir well and let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the Swiss chard and boil for 5 to 6 minutes, or until crisp-tender.  Drain well.

Add the Swiss chard to the tomato mixture, stir well, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Place a layer of bread slices in a deep platter.  Spread just enough of the soup over the bread to cover it.  Sprinkle with some of the Pecorino Romano cheese.  Make a second layer of bread, tomato sauce, and cheese and continue until all the bread and soup is used.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Aunt Santina sent me the recipe for a peasant soup her mother, Mrs. Belurgi, used to carry to the workers in the fields near Veroli, Italy.  The story goes that Mrs. B. would twist a large kitchen towel around her head and tie it securely.  A large bowl of the soup would be propped atop her head, and off she went to the fields, arriving just before the bells of the church tolled the Angelus.  When she arrived, the workers knelt and prayed and then had their soup.

                  Spinach Salad - {Insalata Di Spinaci}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- rinsed, dried well,
                        and cut crosswise into thin strips
  1 1/2           cups  paper-thin sliced mushrooms
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  paper-thin shavings Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        cheese

Place the spinach and mushrooms in a salad bowl.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil and balsamic vinegar together.  Pour over the salad and toss.  Sprinkle on the cheese shavings and toss again.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Spinach is used in many ways in Italian cooking: in rustic pies, in bread, as a filling for stuffed pasta, in gnocchi, and in soup.  In Torgiano, it seemed to be part of every meal.  Simply steamed and dressed with olive oil, it was served as a vegetable accompaniment.  But when combined with paper-thin slices of cheese and mushrooms, it was outstanding as a salad.

             Split Pea Soup - {Minestra Di Piselli Spaccata}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  split peas -- washed and sorted
  3             quarts  water
  1              large  ham bone
  4              large  onions -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  instant chicken bouillon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     bay leaf
  3 1/2           cups  sliced carrots
  3               cups  finely-chopped celery

In a deep pot, combine the peas, water, ham bone, onion, bouillon, and the seasonings.  Simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the ham bone and trim off all the meat; chop it finely and return the meat to the pot.  Stir in the carrots and celery and simmer the soup, uncovered, for about 2 1/2 hours or until the soup is thick.

Serve hot with crusty bread.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Take an almost bare ham bone and make a delicious pea soup.  The idea seemed so impossible to me when I was a child, but my mother had a way of making everything stretch, even a bone could be turned into a meal.  For starters, you need a meaty ham bone.  So the next time you buy a ham on the bone, save the bones, or freeze them and when you have enough, make this wonderful thick soup.

           Squash And Spinach Soup - {Zuppa Di Zucca E Spinaci}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag fresh spinach - (10 oz) -- washed, drained,
                        and stemmed
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and diced
  1              pound  yellow summer squash - (abt 3 small) -- cubed
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled and cubed
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt -- or more to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  ditalini
                        = (or other soup pasta)
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for serving

Place the spinach in a 3-quart soup pot, cover, and cook without any additional water until limp, about 3 minutes.  Drain the spinach in a colander and let cool.  Press out the excess water with a wooden spoon, then coarsely chop the spinach.  Set aside.

Wipe out the soup pot, return it to the heat, and melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the onion and saute over medium heat until soft.  Add the squash and potatoes, and cook the vegetables together, stirring often, for about 5 minutes.  Add the water, milk, salt, and pepper.  Stir, combining ingredients well, cover the pot, and boil gently for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.  Turn off the heat.

In a skillet, heat the remaining butter.  Add the spinach and cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Add the spinach to the soup and stir well to blend.

In a food processor, puree the soup in batches until smooth.  Return the soup to the soup pot and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, boil the pasta in salted water until al dente.  Drain and add to the soup.

To serve, reheat the soup and serve in individual bowls.  Pass the cheese for sprinkling on top.

Variation:  Use thin slices of uncooked yellow squash as a garnish.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Now, this soup uses real ingenuity.  A vibrant green, the soup is beautiful to look at as well as eat.  I call this a kitchen-sink soup because it uses vegetables, milk, and pasta, and was created just by having the ingredients on hand.

           Stuffed Baked Mushrooms - {Funghi Ripieni Al Forno}

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried porcini mushrooms
  1                cup  cold water
  16             large  mushrooms - (2" wide)
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3                     salted anchovies -- mashed
     3/4           cup  toasted bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the porcini in a bowl, cover with cold water, and soak for 30 minutes.  Drain the porcini, cut them in small pieces, and set aside.  Save the soaking water for a soup or sauce.

Wipe the fresh mushrooms with damp paper towels.  Remove the stems by twisting them gently; dice stems and set aside.  Arrange the mushroom caps on a sheet of aluminum foil on a baking sheet, and set aside.

In a skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the mushroom stems and garlic, and saute until stems are soft and liquid has evaporated.  Add the anchovies and porcini, and continue to saute for 1 minute.  Remove the mixture to a bowl.  Add the bread crumbs, cheese, and salt and pepper.  Combine the mixture well and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Fill the mushroom caps with some of the filling, mounding it up slightly.  Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the mushrooms.

Place a second sheet of aluminum foil over the mushrooms and seal the edges by folding in on the foil.  Bake for 25 minutes.  Remove the top sheet of foil and bake an additional 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Mushroom gathering in Italy is almost a secretive and elusive venture.  Those who know where the best spots are for harvesting keep them to themselves.  There are many species available; the most common are boletus, or porcini.  They are cooked very simply with just a touch of seasoning to highlight their woodsy flavor.  When porcini are dried, their flavor intensifies and they can be stored for long periods.  This recipe substitutes large cultivated mushrooms, since fresh porcini are unavailable, but portobellos or creminis can be used.  But using dried porcini as part of the stuffing helps approximate the real thing.

                   Stuffed Tomatoes From Viterbo - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  white onion -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  long-grain rice
  1                cup  hot chicken broth
     1/2           cup  fresh or frozen peas
     1/3           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  diced mozzarella or caciocavallo cheese
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut off the tops of the tomatoes and reserve.  With a spoon, scoop the flesh and seeds from each tomato into a bowl, leaving about a 1/4-inch-thick shell.  If the tomatoes do not stand erect, cut a small slice off the bottom of each one.  Drain the tomatoes upside down on paper towels.  Strain the flesh and seeds through a sieve set over a bowl, pressing on the pulp to extract the juice, and reserve the juice.  Discard the pulp and seeds.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil.  Add the onion and cook over medium heat until it begins to wilt.  Add the rice and stir to coat it well.

Add the reserved tomato juice and the chicken broth, stir once, cover, and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.  Add the peas and cook for 5 minutes more, or until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.

Transfer the rice mixture to a bowl and stir in the bread crumbs, cheese, basil, and salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a baking dish with olive oil.

With a spoon, fill the tomato cavities with the rice mixture.  Replace the tomato tops and place the tomatoes in the baking dish.  Cover the dish with foil and bake the tomatoes for 30 minutes.  Uncover the dish and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until golden brown on top.  Serve the tomatoes hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Viterbo is about two hours north of Rome, a city rich with medieval architecture, ancient towers, splendid fountains, and friendly piazzas.  But of all of its treasures, the most memorable to me are Viterbo's tomatoes stuffed with rice and peas.  Eaten at room temperature as a merenda, or snack, they are also delicious served hot as an accompaniment to meat, poultry, or fish.  I love them so much that they are a must for company when tomatoes are in season.  Leftovers are good the next day.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped plum or cherry tomatoes
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  6             slices  stale bread -- crust removed
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced Spanish onion
  1                cup  seeded and diced cucumber
     1/4           cup  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2              large  basil leaves -- torn into pieces
                        === DRESSING ===
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt - (to 1)

Place the tomatoes in a small bowl, stir in the sugar, and set aside.

Tear the bread into chunks and dip them quickly into a bowl of room temperature water.  Squeeze the water out and crumble the bread into a salad bowl.  Add the tomatoes, onion, cucumber, parsley and basil, and toss gently.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss again.  Cover the salad and allow it to sit at room temperature for several hours.

Just before serving, toss the salad gently.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Panzanella means "bread in a swamp" and is a summer salad that is popular all over Italy.  In Tuscany this was originally a country dish eaten for breakfast or for a snack.  Usually tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers make up the dish as well as stale bread which is moistened in water or vinegar and combined with the vegetables and extra virgin olive oil.  I cannot stress enough that the quality of the bread is critical to the salad.  Make this early in the day and hold it at room temperature so all the flavors can mingle and the bread becomes permeated with the juices of the tomatoes.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  very ripe plum tomatoes
  1 1/4         pounds  zucchini -- sliced thick rounds
     3/4         pound  green beans
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1             medium  white onion -- diced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2               cups  Homemade Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch the tomatoes for about 1 minute, just to loosen the skin.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the tomatoes and let cool, then peel and dice them.  Set aside.

Add the zucchini to the boiling water and cook until very soft, about 10 minutes.  Using the slotted spoon, transfer the zucchini to a colander and drain well, then transfer to a food processor or blender.

Add the green beans to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain well.  Add half the beans to the food processor, and transfer the remaining beans to a bowl.

Process the vegetables in the processor until very smooth.  Set Aside.  Cut the remaining beans into small pieces and set aside.

In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onion and prosciutto and cook until the onion is soft and the prosciutto is crisp, about 5 minutes.  Add the basil and parsley and cook for 1 minute longer.  Add the pureed vegetables, the remaining beans, the tomatoes, lemon zest, lemon juice, and chicken broth.  Stir well.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and bring just to a simmer.  Season the soup with salt and pepper and ladle into bowls.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                   Sweet And Sour Yellow Pumpkin - ...

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  sugar pumpkin or butternut squash
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3                     fresh basil leaves -- torn into pieces
  4                     fresh mint leaves -- minced
     1/3           cup  olive oil - (to 1/2)
  1              large  garlic clove -- cut in half
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut the stem off and peel the pumpkin or squash.  Cut the pumpkin or squash in half, remove the seeds and stringy pulp, and discard.  Cut flesh into strips 1/8 inch thick, 2 inches wide, and about 4 inches long.  Set aside.

In a 9- by  12-inch glass dish, mix the vinegar and sugar until the sugar dissolves.  Add the basil and mint, mix, and set aside.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil, add the garlic, and press it into the oil with the back of a wooden spoon.  Remove the garlic when it starts to turn color and discard it.  Fry the pumpkin or squash pieces in batches for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until they soften and start to look glazed and brown.

Remove the strips from the skillet and add them to the vinegar mixture.  Add salt and pepper, and stir to mix well.  Cover the dish and marinate at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours before serving.  Or refrigerate and serve the next day at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  In Italy, pumpkin, or zucca, is used as a filling for ravioli, to make gnocchi, baked into bread, and pureed for soup.  In Sicily, pumpkin is marinated and served as an antipasto.  The beautiful orange color of this dish, mingled with dark green basil leaves and flecks of refreshing mint, reminds one of a beautiful fall day in New England.  I use butternut squash because the taste approximates the sweet pumpkins of Sicily.  If you use pumpkin, be sure to buy a small sugar pumpkin; a big jack-o-lantern doesn't have any flavor.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  spaghetti squash -- halved, seeded,
                        and cut into quarters
  4 1/2           cups  water
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              pound  leeks, white part only -- washed well,
                        halved lengthwise, and cut 1/4"-thk slices
  2                     zucchini - (12 oz total) -- halved lengthwise,
                        then cut into 1/4"-thick slices
  1 1/4         pounds  butternut squash -- peeled, halved,
                        seeded, and cut into 1/4" pieces
  4               cups  pureed cherry tomatoes - (2 lbs)
  1                cup  hot water
  3 1/2       teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  orzo
                        = (or other small soup pasta)
  6                     fresh basil leaves - (to 8) -- minced

Preheat the over to 375 degrees.

Place the spaghetti squash quarters cut-side down in a baking pan with 1/2 cup of water.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake until the squash is soft, about 30 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, scoop the pulp from the cavity and transfer it to a food processor or blender.  Puree the squash until smooth (you may have to do it in batches).  There should be about 1 1/2 cups.  Transfer the squash to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.  (Can be prepared a day or two ahead.)

While the squash is baking, melt the butter in a soup pot, add the leeks, and cook, covered, over low heat for 3 minutes, stirring a few times.  Add the zucchini and butternut squash, stir to evenly mix the vegetables, cover the pot, and continue to cook over low heat for about 12 minutes.  The vegetables should retain their shape and be al dente but cooked.  Stir in the tomatoes, hot water, pureed squash, and 2 teaspoons of salt.  Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring the remaining 4 cups of water to a boil, stir in the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the orzo and cook until the orzo is al dente, about 10 minutes.  Drain and stir the orzo into the soup.  Stir in the basil and serve.

Tip:  Using a nonstick soup pot in this recipe eliminates the need to add much fat when cooking the leeks and vegetables.

Note:  Spaghetti squash can be cooked in a microwave on high power for 5 to 6 minutes per pound.  Be sure to pierce the rind first before microwaving to prevent an explosion.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 quarts.

Preheat the over to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the spaghetti squash quarters cut-side down in a baking pan with 1/2 cup of water.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake until the squash is soft, about 30 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, scoop the pulp from the cavity and transfer it to a food processor or blender.  Puree the squash until smooth (you may have to do it in batches).  There should be about 1 1/2 cups.  Transfer the squash to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.  (Can be prepared a day or two ahead.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the squash is baking, melt the butter in a soup pot, add the leeks, and cook, covered, over low heat for 3 minutes, stirring a few times.  Add the zucchini and butternut squash, stir to evenly mix the vegetables, cover the pot, and continue to cook over low heat for about 12 minutes.  The vegetables should retain their shape and be al dente but cooked.  Stir in the tomatoes, hot water, pureed squash, and 2 teaspoons of salt.  Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, bring the remaining 4 cups of water to a boil, stir in the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the orzo and cook until the orzo is al dente, about 10 minutes.  Drain and stir the orzo into the soup.  Stir in the basil and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  Using a nonstick soup pot in this recipe eliminates the need to add much fat when cooking the leeks and vegetables.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Spaghetti squash can be cooked in a microwave on high power for 5 to 6 minutes per pound.  Be sure to pierce the rind first before microwaving to prevent an explosion.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 1/2 quarts.

                 Tomato Bread Soup - {Pappa Al Pomodoro}

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut in half
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  leeks, white bulb only -- finely diced
  12                    basil leaves -- minced
  3               cups  hot chicken or vegetable broth
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  3               cups  stale bread in 1" cubes

Puree the tomatoes in a food processor until smooth.  Pour the mixture into a fine sieve placed over a large bowl.  Strain the juice by pressing down with a wooden spoon and discard the seeds and skins.  Set aside.

Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large soup pot, stir in the leeks and half of the basil and cook until the leeks soften.  Stir in the tomato juice, broth, salt, and pepper and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Keep the soup covered off the heat.

Heat the remaining olive oil in a large saute pan.  Stir in the remaining basil and the bread cubes.  Brown the bread quickly over medium heat.  Stir the cubes into the soup.  Cover the pan and allow the bread to absorb the liquid.

When ready to serve, slowly reheat the soup.  Pass extra virgin olive oil to drizzle on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Pappa al pomodoro is not easy to describe; it is like pap, a thick, soupy tomato mixture.  It is an old-fashioned country dish that has come back into vogue and like so many other Tuscan soups that have bread as a component, this soup is thickened by mixing bread into it.  The secret to this soup is to use meaty, juicy plum tomatoes when they are at their peak and good coarse day-old bread.  This is one of the ways that I like to use up summer tomatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- peeled and sliced
  2             pounds  chicken livers -- washed and dried
  1                can  anchovies in olive oil - (2 oz) -- oil drained
     1/4           cup  capers in salt -- rinsed
     1/2           cup  brandy
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Bread in small slices, abt 2" in diameter
                        Sage leaves -- for garnish
                        Cherry tomato slices -- for garnish

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat.  Stir in the onions and saute them until they begin to soften.  Do not let them brown.  Add the remaining olive oil and the chicken livers and saute them, turning them occasionally.  Use a small knife to pierce one of the livers as they are cooking; when the center is no longer red-brown in color, stir in the anchovies and the capers and cook for another 2 minutes.  Pour in the brandy and allow it to evaporate.  Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice and salt.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor and process until a paste is obtained.  Transfer the mixture to a container and refrigerate.

When ready to serve, bring the liver mixture to room temperature.  Toast small pieces of bread and spread some of the liver mixture over the top of the slices.  Garnish with a small sage leaf and a cherry tomato slice.  Serve the crostini at room temperature.

This recipe yields 2 to 2 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Crostini are small pieces of toasted bread with various toppings.  A popular one in Tuscany features chicken livers with capers.  This recipe makes a lot and is great for a party.  This is best made in a food processor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     carrot -- scraped, and
                        cut into quarters
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and quartered
  1                     celery rib -- cut in half
  3              large  parsley sprigs
  4                     garlic cloves
  4              whole  basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  fresh marjoram
  1         tablespoon  fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary needles
  4              whole  sage leaves
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     bay leaf
  1 3/4         pounds  stew beef -- trimmed of all
                        visible fat and cut into 1" cubes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1                cup  vin santo or moscato wine
  2               cups  hot beef broth
  1         tablespoon  whole green peppercorns in vinegar -- drained
                        Zest of 1 lemon
  3                     ripe William, Anjou, or Bartlett pears

In a food processor or with a chef's knife, mince together the carrot, onion, celery, parsley, garlic, basil, thyme, marjoram, mint, rosemary, and sage.  Set it aside.

In an ovenproof 10 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and stir in the minced vegetables and herbs and saute them, stirring occasionally, until they soften, but do not let them brown.  Transfer the ingredients to a dish and set is aside.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

Dry the meat with paper towels; sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper.  Add the remaining olive oil to the pan and when the oil begins to shimmer, add the bay leaf and meat and saute, turning the meat frequently to brown it.  When there is no more liquid in the pan, raise the heat to high, add the wine and allow it to reduce by half.  Lower the heat and pour in the beef broth to cover the meat.  Return the vegetable mixture to the pan and stir in the peppercorns and the lemon zest.  Cover the pan and bake in the oven for 1 hour.

Peel and core the pears.  Dice 2 of the pears, then cover and set them aside.  Puree the remaining pear in a food processor or blender until it is smooth.  Cover and set it aside.

Stir the pureed pear into the meat mixture.  Cover the pan and bake for an additional 1 1/2 hours, adding more broth if necessary.  Five minutes before the meat is done, remove the bay leaf and add the diced pears.

Serve immediately.  This stew can also be refrigerated for several days.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Beef stew with pears?  Absolutely delicious when made by my friends Giovanni and Iris Lodovici.  This antique Tuscan recipe is known as peposo (from the word pepe for "pepper") and its origins go back to tilemakers who prepared a calderone (big pot) of stew and placed it at the mouth of the fornace (oven) while they made tiles.  They left the stew to cook for many hours, which resulted in deliciously tender meat in a beautiful sauce made with vin santo (holy wine).  In today's Tuscan kitchen pears have been replaced by tomatoes and the dish is more commonly referred to as peposo dell'Impruneta, taking its name from the town of Impruneta near Florence where the tiles that are famous all over the world (cotto dell'impruneta) are still made.  In this dish the true worth of the four evangelists of Italian cooking is evident.  Vin Santo is made in many areas of Italy and is a beautiful amber-colored, high-alcohol dessert wine.  If it is not available, use a good moscato wine.  For quick work in the kitchen use a food processor to mince the vegetables and herbs.  Make the dish several days ahead and refrigerate, to really meld the flavors.

In a food processor or with a chef&apos;s knife, mince together the carrot, onion, celery, parsley, garlic, basil, thyme, marjoram, mint, rosemary, and sage.  Set it aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In an ovenproof 10 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and stir in the minced vegetables and herbs and saute them, stirring occasionally, until they soften, but do not let them brown.  Transfer the ingredients to a dish and set is aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dry the meat with paper towels; sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper.  Add the remaining olive oil to the pan and when the oil begins to shimmer, add the bay leaf and meat and saute, turning the meat frequently to brown it.  When there is no more liquid in the pan, raise the heat to high, add the wine and allow it to reduce by half.  Lower the heat and pour in the beef broth to cover the meat.  Return the vegetable mixture to the pan and stir in the peppercorns and the lemon zest.  Cover the pan and bake in the oven for 1 hour.

Peel and core the pears.  Dice 2 of the pears, then cover and set them aside.  Puree the remaining pear in a food processor or blender until it is smooth.  Cover and set it aside.

<DirT>
Stir the pureed pear into the meat mixture.  Cover the pan and bake for an additional 1 1/2 hours, adding more broth if necessary.  Five minutes before the meat is done, remove the bay leaf and add the diced pears.

<DirT>
Serve immediately.  This stew can also be refrigerated for several days.

Comments:  Beef stew with pears?  Absolutely delicious when made by my friends Giovanni and Iris Lodovici.  This antique Tuscan recipe is known as peposo (from the word pepe for &quot;pepper&quot;) and its origins go back to tilemakers who prepared a calderone (big pot) of stew and placed it at the mouth of the fornace (oven) while they made tiles.  They left the stew to cook for many hours, which resulted in deliciously tender meat in a beautiful sauce made with vin santo (holy wine).  In today&apos;s Tuscan kitchen pears have been replaced by tomatoes and the dish is more commonly referred to as peposo dell&apos;Impruneta, taking its name from the town of Impruneta near Florence where the tiles that are famous all over the world (cotto dell&apos;impruneta) are still made.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  veal bones
  1              large  carrot -- peeled and quartered
  1              large  onion -- unpeeled, quartered
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1              large  bay leaf
  1                     celery rib -- cut in half
  1                cup  hot water
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Generously oil a roasting pan.  Add all the ingredients except the water and salt and pepper and roast for about 45 minutes, turning occasionally, until the veal bones are nicely browned.  Transfer all of the ingredients to a large soup pot.

Pour the hot water into the roasting pan and, using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan.  Add this liquid to the soup pot along with enough water to just cover the ingredients.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and let simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove the bones and strain the stock through a cheesecloth-lined colander set over a bowl.  Press hard on the solids with a wooden spoon to extract all the juices.  Discard the solids.  Season the stock with salt and pepper.  The stock is ready to use.  It can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts.

Comments:  Homemade stocks can be the building blocks of flavor for so many dishes.  For rich veal stock, keep a supply of inexpensive veal shoulder bones in the freezer.  Veal stock provides a light flavor for mushroom- and pasta-based dishes such as Pappardelle con Vitello.

                   Warm Farro And Chickpea Salad - ...

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  farro
     2/3           cup  dried chickpeas
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  4             sprigs  Italian parsley - (to 5) -- stemmed, plus
                        extra for garnish
  3                     fresh sage leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- needles only
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4         pound  cremini or button mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  8                     cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/4           cup  reserved cooking water from chickpeas
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
  12                    small slices baguette-style bread cut 1/2"

Put the chickpeas in a bowl and cover them with water; in another bowl, cover the farro with water and allow both to soak overnight.  Doing this will eliminate a long cooking time.

The next day drain the water from the chickpeas and transfer them to a pot; cover them with clean water and cook for 15 minutes or just until they are tender and the outer skins easily slip off.  Drain the chickpeas, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid and set aside.  Repeat the process for the farro, cooking them about 20 minutes or just until al dente.  They should have a bit of a bite and not be mushy.  Depending on the farro, it may cook in even less time.

Mince the garlic, parsley, sage, and rosemary together.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan; stir in the garlic, parsley, sage, rosemary and oregano.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the mushrooms and cook them until they soften and begin to give off their liquid.  Stir in the tomatoes and cook 2 minutes more.  Stir in the chickpeas, farro, and the reserved cooking water.  Stir and cook for 3 minutes more.  Stir in the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes and cook 1 minute longer.  Keep the mixture warm while the bread is toasting.

Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and toast them until golden brown in a 350 degrees pre-heated oven for 5 to 7 minutes.

Place two slices of toasted bread side by side on each of 6 salad dishes.  Evenly divide and spoon the farro mixture over the bread slices.  Garnish with extra parsley and drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over the top.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Here is more evidence that farro is enjoying a comeback in today's kitchen.  The inspiration for this warm farro and chickpea salad comes from another Umbrian chef Donatella Lauteri.  Begin the process the day before with soaking the farro and the chickpeas.

         Zucchini Tart Viareggio Style - {Scarpaccia Viareggina}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small zucchini
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Butter and flour a 9- by 12- by 2 1/2-inch or a 7- by 11-inch baking dish and set it aside.

Cut the zucchini into thin rounds.  Layer them in a colander and sprinkle salt between each layer.  Place a weight such as a 28-ounce can of tomatoes on the zucchini to weigh the slices down.  Allow the zucchini to "sweat" for 1 hour.  Then rinse and dry the slices and set them aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, whisk together the butter, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.  Stir in the milk, salt, and flour to create a batter.  Fold in the zucchini.

Pour the mixture into the baking dish.  Drizzle the top with the olive oil.

Bake for 40 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the center.

Serve warm cut into squares.

Note:  Small size zucchini have less water, less seeds, and are more tender than larger ones.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Viareggio is a coastal city famous for its Carnival, where you might sample scarpaccia Viareggina, a delicious slightly sweet zucchini tart and likely ask yourself if it's a dessert or a savory?  It could be both and at one time was served after the meal, but today is thought of more as a snack food.  It takes its name from the word scarpa for shoe, because it looks well cooked when taken from the oven, like a well-worn shoe.

               Zucchini, Red Pepper And Ricotta Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh mint
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4         pound  ricotta salata -- grated
  3              small  zucchini -- cut into thin strips
  1              large  sweet red pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into thin strips
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper

Combine the olive oil, vinegar, mint, and salt in a jar and shake well.  Set aside.

In a salad bowl combine the ricotta salata, zucchini, and red pepper.  Pour the dressing over the top and toss well.  Top with a grinding of black pepper.  To serve the salad later the same day, cover with a piece of plastic wrap and allow it to marinate for several hours at room temperature.  If making the salad a day ahead, refrigerate it and bring it to room temperature the following day.

Did you know that the ancient Romans chewed on fresh mint leaves after meals to refresh and clean their mouths?

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Fresh sheep's-milk ricotta cheese is also made into ricotta salata (salted ricotta) by salting and aging fresh ricotta cheese.  As it ages it becomes firm and gratable.  Sicilians like to use it over bucatini, a thick spaghetti-like pasta hollowed out like a long tube, and it is just right sprinkled over this marinated zucchini, red pepper, and mint salad.  Make the salad a day ahead to allow the flavors to mingle.  Look for ricotta salata in Italian grocery stores or in your supermarket dairy section.  A good substitute is feta cheese, which will need to be crumbled instead of grated.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small zucchini -- cut into chunks
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     white onion -- minced
     1/2           cup  finely-diced dried tomatoes
  2               cups  hot chicken broth
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced fresh mint
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- (optional)

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Add the zucchini and cook until soft enough for a knife to penetrate the skin easily, about 10 minutes.  Drain and place the chunks in a food processor or blender.  Puree the zucchini until very smooth.  Set aside.

In a soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook until very soft but not browned.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the zucchini, chicken broth, and salt and pepper, lower the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the mint and simmer for 5 minutes longer.

Ladle the soup into serving bowls and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This soup is a good starter for just about any occasion.  To make quick work of this recipe, I keep bags of pureed zucchini and dried tomatoes in the freezer.
