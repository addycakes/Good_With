  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

  2                     small heads cauliflower - (or 1 large) -- cut small bunches
                        of florets
  3                     celery ribs and leafy tops from
                        the heart of stalk -- finely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  chicken broth
  1                cup  half-and-half or whole milk
                        Hot sauce -- (optional)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves or chives -- for garnish
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan -- for passing at table
                        === Dippers ===
  3                     sandwich-size sourdough English muffins -- split
                        = (Thomas' brand recommended)
  3        tablespoons  butter

In a large pot, heat up the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter, over medium heat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the cauliflower florets and stir with a wooden spoon.  Add celery, onion and thyme and cook for 3 minutes.  Push the vegetables to 1 side of the pot.

Melt 1 more tablespoon of butter on empty side of pot and add flour to the butter.  Cook for 1 minute, stirring the flour in the butter.  Mix in chicken broth and half-and-half.  Bring up to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.  Puree soup using an emersion blender, food processor or blender and return to pot.  I like to leave it a little chunky.  Check seasoning and add a dash of hot sauce, if desired.

Garnish soup with hot pepper sauce, chopped parsley or chives and serve with grated cheese to sprinkle on top.

Preheat broiler.

Toast English muffin halves and then place on a cookie sheet.  In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the garlic over low heat.  Brush toasted muffins with garlic butter and top with lots of grated cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.  Sprinkle a little paprika over toasts, then place under broiler until cheeses are melted and browned.  Serve cheesy toasts with soup for dipping.

     1/2                seedless cucumber -- chopped
  2                     vine-ripe tomatoes -- chopped
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1                can  quartered artichoke hearts in water -- drained
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cans  imported tuna in oil -- drained
  12                    pepperoncini hot peppers
  1                cup  pitted kalamata olives

Arrange the cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and peppers, artichoke hearts and parsley on a platter.  Squeeze the lemon juice over the platter, juicing the fruit cut-side-up to keep the seeds from falling into salad.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place shallots, vinegar and oregano in a bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Whisk in extra-virgin olive oil in a slow stream.  Pour dressing over salad.  Garnish salad with chunks of tuna, hot peppers and olives.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (6 to 8 oz ea),
                        butterflied into large cutlets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped sage leaves
  8             slices  prosciutto
                        = (other deli sliced meat that is not
                        smoked may be substituted)
     1/2         pound  fontina cheese -- thinly sliced
                        = (Italian or Danish, available in
                        specialty cheese case usually located
                        near deli section of larger markets)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  8                     baby portobello (crimini) mushrooms -- sliced
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (chicken broth may be substituted)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              pound  triple washed spinach

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Place cutlets on a plastic cutting board and season with salt and pepper.  Top with chopped sage, 2 slices prosciutto each and a few thin slices of fontina.  Roll tightly and secure with toothpicks.  Season outside of rolls with more salt and pepper, then dredge in flour.

Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan and 1 tablespoon butter to the pan.  Add chicken and raise heat to medium-high.  Brown the rolls evenly, 5 minutes, then place on a nonstick cookie sheet and transfer to oven to roast for 15 minutes longer.

Add another tablespoon butter to the pan and melt it.  Add mushrooms to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until just tender 3 or 4 minutes.  Add flour and cook another minute.  Whisk in stock.  Season pan gravy with mushrooms with salt and pepper and turn off heat.  Reheat with moderate flame when you remove chicken rolls from the oven and you are ready to serve.

Preheat a second skillet over medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil 2 turns of the pan, and the garlic.  Add the spinach to the pan in bunches and turn to wilt.  Add more spinach as it wilts down until all the spinach is in the pan.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste and serve warm.

To plate, leave rolls whole and spill sauce over top, spinach alongside, or, slice rolls and fan them out over a bed of spinach and top with mushroom sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Ask butcher to butterfly the breasts into large cutlets for you.  This is a real time-saver!  If a butcher is not available to you, cut into each breast from the fatter side and work across the breast, leaving them attached at the opposite side.  Open the breast up and pound lightly with a mallet to about a 1/4-inch thickness.  Also, in many supermarkets chicken cutlets are available in packages.  They are small pieces of thinly sliced breast meat.  Simply adapt the method and make 2 small roll-ups rather than 1 large roll up per portion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     red bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  3                     hot cherry peppers -- drained, chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped, or
                        thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock or broth
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  juice from hot pepper jar
                        Orzo With Parsley And Lemon Zest -- (see recipe)

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Cut chicken into large chunks and season with salt and pepper and poultry seasoning.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin oil to the hot pan, 1 turn in a slow stream.  Set chicken into pan and do not turn for 2 or 3 minutes or you will tear the meat.  Brown chicken 3 minutes on each side and then remove all of the chicken to a warm plate.

Add bell peppers, hot peppers and garlic to the pan.  Saute the peppers and garlic for 5 minutes, tossing and turning them frequently.  Add wine to the pan and reduce 1 minute.  Scrape up the pan drippings.

Add the chicken stock and bring it up to a bubble.  Set the chicken back into the pan.  Toss the parsley with the chicken and peppers and cook the chicken through, 2 or 3 minutes.  Scatter a little hot pepper juice over the pan and serve the Scarpariello over a bed of lemon orzo.  WOW!

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Cut chicken into large chunks and season with salt and pepper and poultry seasoning.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin oil to the hot pan, 1 turn in a slow stream.  Set chicken into pan and do not turn for 2 or 3 minutes or you will tear the meat.  Brown chicken 3 minutes on each side and then remove all of the chicken to a warm plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add bell peppers, hot peppers and garlic to the pan.  Saute the peppers and garlic for 5 minutes, tossing and turning them frequently.  Add wine to the pan and reduce 1 minute.  Scrape up the pan drippings.

<DirT>
Add the chicken stock and bring it up to a bubble.  Set the chicken back into the pan.  Toss the parsley with the chicken and peppers and cook the chicken through, 2 or 3 minutes.  Scatter a little hot pepper juice over the pan and serve the Scarpariello over a bed of lemon orzo.  WOW!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         stick  butter -- melted
  3                     sheets phyllo pastry dough
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2                 thin-cut boneless skinless chicken breasts -- sliced into thin
                        strips on an angle
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              small  yellow skinned onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  sun-dried tomatoes in oil drained -- chopped
                        = (abt 10 to 12 pieces)
  2                     boxes chopped spinach -- thawed, squeezed dry
     3/4         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Brush 6- or 12-cup muffin tins with butter using pastry brush.  Brush a layer of phyllo dough with butter, top with a second sheet of pastry, butter, then season the phyllo with salt and pepper and then top with a third sheet.  Cut into 6 or 12 squares and arrange the phyllo in cups, allowing the dough to crumple and spill out of the tops of the tins.  Brush the inside of the pastry cups with remaining butter.  Bake until golden, 5 to 8 minutes.  Cool.

To a skillet preheated over medium-high heat add chicken, garlic and onions and season with salt and pepper.  Saute 5 minutes, add the sun-dried tomatoes and spinach and cook another 3 to 5 minutes.  Add feta and taste to adjust seasonings.

To serve, place phyllo cups on a serving platter and fill with mounds of chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and spinach mixture.  A hearty vegetable and olive salad makes a perfect starter or side to this delicious, quick cross between chicken pot pies and spanakopita.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Curried Carrot Soup

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  packaged baby carrots
  6               cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  mild curry paste
                        = (or 1 1/2 tbspns curry powder)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper - (to 1/2)
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  1                cup  sour cream
                        Plastic condiment bottle or medium
                        plastic food storage bag
  6                     blades fresh chives -- cut 1" pieces

Preheat medium pot over medium-high heat.  Add olive oil, butter, onions and carrots and saute 5 minutes.  Add 4 cups chicken stock, curry and cayenne, and about 1 teaspoon salt to the pot.  Bring to a boil, cover and cook until carrots are very tender, about 15 minutes.

Place pot on a trivet next to food processor.  Process soup in 2 or 3 small batches until soup is smooth and carrots are fully pureed.  Transfer processed soup into a large bowl as you work to make room for more soup in the food processor.

Return completed soup to the soup pot and place back over low heat.  If the soup is too thick, add remaining stock, up to 2 cups, to achieve desired consistency.  Adjust seasonings.

Place sour cream in a plastic condiment squeeze bottle or into a medium food storage bag.  Cut a very small hole in the corner of the bag with scissors.

Ladle soup into bowls and squirt a swirl of sour cream around the bowl from the center out to the rim.  Drag a toothpick from the center of the bowls out to the edges, forming a spider web design on soup.  Pile a few pieces of cut chives at the center of each bowl to resemble green spiders in their webs!  Cool!

This recipe yields up to six 1 1/2-cup servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  ripe Hass avocados
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  1              small  plum tomato -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
     1/2         small  yellow skinned onion -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
                        Blue corn tortilla chips -- for dipping

Cut avocados in half around the pit.  Separate the halves.  Pop out pit with spoon, then scoop flesh of avocados into a bowl.  Squeeze the juice of a lemon over the avocados.

Squeeze the juice with the lemon halves facing cut-side up, allowing the juice to spill down over the sides of the lemon into the bowl.  This method keeps the seeds in the lemon and out of the guacamole.

Add garlic, jalapeÒo, tomato, onion and salt to the bowl.  Mash and mix the ingredients into a chunky dip using a fork.  Serve with blue corn tortilla chips.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     green bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" dice
  3                     vine-ripe tomatoes -- seeded, diced
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
     1/2                lemon -- juiced (1 tbspn)
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin

Combine peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, parsley in a bowl with your fingertips.  Squeeze the juice of the lemon with the lemon half sitting upright.  This will help prevent the seeds from falling into the bowl.  The lemon juice will spill down over the sides of the lemon and the seeds will remain with the fruit.  Squeeze the juice evenly over the salad.  If the lemon is under-ripe, microwave it for 10 seconds before you cut into it.

Next, sprinkle a tablespoon of vinegar over the salad -- just eyeball it.  Drizzle the extra-virgin olive oil over the salad, add the salt, pepper and cumin.  Toss again.  Taste to adjust seasonings and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Pierce the casings of knockwurst and arrange in medium skillet.  Add 1 inch of water, bring to a simmer and warm wursts through.  Remove from the pan.  Drain the skillet and add butter.  Melt butter over medium heat.  Cut each knockwurst into 1/3 and add back to the pan to crisp casings.  Add sauerkraut to the pan, sprinkle in caraway, add bay leaf and peppercorns.  Pour the beer into the skillet.  When the beer comes to a bubble reduce heat to simmer.

Add smoked chops to the pan and caramelize meat on both sides, 2 or 3 minutes.  Remove chops to a plate and loosely cover with foil.  Pour the beer into the pan and reduce heat to a simmer.

When you are ready to serve, cut several slices of pumpernickel in half down the middle.  Place a bowl of spicy mustard alongside the pumpernickel bread for passing at the table.

Place 2 or 3 chunks of the knockwurst on each dinner plate on a bed of spiced sauerkraut.  Serve 3 pieces of smoked pork chops topped with bacon, apples and onions.  Place deli style large dill or half sour pickles, German cheeses and pretzels out for an evening of uber snacking!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     packaged lobster tails - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        = (shell jumbo shrimp or prawns can be
                        substituted)
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              small  white onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Splash dry white wine or dry sherry
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/3           cup  grated white cheddar
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika or crab boil seasoning
                        = (Old Bay recommended)
  2        tablespoons  Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  bread crumbs
  1                     handful parsley leaves -- mixed with
  2               cups  baby greens -- for plate garnish
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Bring a pot of water to a boil, 3 or 4 inches deep.  Add lobster tails to the water and boil 7 to 8 minutes.  Drain and shock under cold water to cool.  Use kitchen scissors to cut away soft underside of tails.  Remove meat and save the shells, arranging them in a shallow casserole dish.  Chop the cooked meat on an angle into chunks.

Preheat your broiler to high.

Heat a medium skillet and a small saucepot over medium heat.  To the small saucepot, melt 2 tablespoons butter.  Add finely chopped onion and cook 3 to 5 minutes until very soft.  To the skillet, add remaining 2 tablespoons butter.  When the butter melts, add chopped lobster meat and saute.

Add flour to sauce pot with onions and cook together another 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk in wine or sherry, then milk.  Remove sauce from heat and stir in cheddar cheese and paprika or crab boil.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over lobster meat and stir to combine.

Pour lobster into and over the shells in a casserole dish and top with Parmesan and bread crumbs.  Broil on high until golden, 2 or 3 minutes.  Serve each tail, spilling over with lobster bits in sauce, on a bed of mixed baby greens and parsley with wedges of lemon along side.

To make this dish with jumbo shrimp, cut up peeled, deveined raw shrimp.  Saute the shrimp in butter, as with cooked lobster.  Cook until pink and firm and proceed with method.  Place the shrimp and sauce into a small casserole, then spoon completed shrimp Thermidor over bed of greens and parsley leaves.

Place the meat in a bowl and score it into 4 equal sections and form the meat into patties.  Season each patty with grill seasoning.  Pour a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce into a small dish and using a pastry brush, lightly baste the burgers with sauce.

Drizzle a touch of oil into the 1 hot skillet and arrange the burgers.  Do not move the meat for 2 minutes.  Turn and sear the reverse side to caramelize the meat.  Lower the heat slightly and cook 5 minutes longer on each side.

Place bacon slices in the other skillet and cook for 3 minutes on each side, until crisp.  Drain fat and reserve bacon.

Return the skillet to the stove top.  Add 2 tablespoons oil, the garlic and mushrooms to the pan.  Thinly slice sage leaves, then add to the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.  Saute the garlic and mushrooms 5 minutes until just tender.  Deglaze the pan with dry sherry and scrape up the pan drippings.

Pile the mushrooms on top of burgers, then top with bacon and cheese and cover with lid or foil to melt cheese.  Transfer burgers to dinner plates.  Pass grainy mustard at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     portobello mushroom caps
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for drizzling
  1 1/2         pounds  ground sirloin
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  dark chili powder
  1         tablespoon  steak seasoning blend
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  8             ounces  smoked white cheddar -- sliced
                        = (or smoked gouda)
  2                     roasted red peppers -- drained
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro leaves
                        = (or flat-leaf parsley)
                        Macho Gazpacho Vegetable Chunk Salad -- (see recipe)

Preheat grill pan or large nonstick griddle pan over medium-high to high heat.  Brush mushroom caps with damp towel to clean them.  Scrape away gills with a spoon.

Combine Worcestershire sauce with balsamic vinegar, then whisk in 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil.  Brush mushrooms with dressing.  Grill mushrooms on hot grill pan or griddle for 3 or 4 minutes on each side, until tender.  Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.

Combine meat in a bowl with onion, garlic, jalapeno, tomato paste, chili powder and steak seasoning blend.  Form meat into 4 large (1 1/2 inch-thick) patties.  Grill meat 4 to 7 minutes on each side for medium-rare to well-done burgers.  Melt cheese over burgers during the last minute or 2 the meat is on the grill.  A loose foil tent will help the cheese melt quicker.

While the meat cooks, grind the roasted red peppers in a food processor with cilantro or parsley.

To assemble, place a portobello cap-side-down on a plate and spread a spoonful or 2 of the ground roasted red peppers into the cavity.  Top with a chili-smoked cheese burger and serve.  Macho Gazpacho Chunk Vegetable Salad makes a great side dish.

          Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breasts With Tomato And Basil

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fingerling potatoes or
                        red skin baby potatoes
  1              small  red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin strips
  1                     Italian mild green pepper, cubanelle -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1             medium  yellow skinned onion -- thinly sliced
  4              large  garlic cloves -- cracked away from
                        skin
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  shredded Parmesan
                        = (make sure to get shredded cheese, not
                        grated)
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
  4                     plum Roma tomatoes or small
                        vine ripe tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  15                    fresh basil leaves - (to 20) -- pile leaves, roll,
                        then thinly slice - chiffonade

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Cut fingerling potatoes into halves or quarters, depending on thickness of fingerlings -- thin, small fingerlings may also be left hole, larger potatoes should be quartered to speed cooking process.  If you are using small red potatoes, halve or quarter them in the same way.

Cover a large cookie sheet with foil.  Place potatoes on cookie sheet.  Combine with peppers and onions, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes.  Coat the potatoes, peppers and onions with extra-virgin olive oil just enough to coat vegetables in a thin layer, 2 to 3 tablespoons.  Season liberally with salt and pepper.

Place potatoes in the oven and roast 20 to 22 minutes, until potatoes are just tender and peppers and onions are crisp at edges.  Toss mixture with tongs, turning the potatoes after 15 minutes.  When the potatoes are cooked, transfer them to a serving dish and peel the foil off the cookie sheet and discard for super-quick clean up!

While potatoes cook, prepare chicken.  Roll out a 2-foot piece of waxed paper or foil near the stove top.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat -- your pan must be very hot when the chicken is added.  Pile the shredded cheese on the work surface created with the waxed paper or foil.

Season your chicken breasts with black pepper but no salt; the cheese will add enough salt to the taste of the dish.  Press the breasts firmly into the cheese.  Coat both sides of breasts with as much cheese as possible.

Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, 1 turn of the pan.  Set breasts into the skillet and cook 7 minutes on each side, until cheese forms an even, golden casing around the tender chicken breasts.

While chicken cooks, combine chopped tomatoes with basil in a small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Drain off any excess oil from chicken as you remove it from the skillet.  Top chicken with big spoonfuls of raw sauce and serve with potatoes, peppers and onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Passport To Japan: Edamame, Gyoza, Rice And Teriyaki Beef

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GYOZA -- RICE AND EDAMAME ===
     3/4           cup  short grain rice
  2               cups  edamame (soybeans)
                        = (from the frozen vegetables section of
                        large markets)
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Napa cabbage -- plus
  1                     large whole Napa cabbage leaf
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     1/4         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  baby shrimp - (300 count) -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sake
                        = (or a splash mirin may be substituted)
  1                     inch fresh ginger -- minced
  1                     scallion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  tamari dark aged soy
                        = (available on Asian food aisle of
                        market)
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        A few grinds black pepper
  12                    gyoza or won ton wrappers
                        === TERIYAKI STEAK ===
  2                     fillet beef steaks -- 1"-thick - (6 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  steak seasoning
                        = (or salt and pepper)
     1/3           cup  teriyaki sauce
                        = (or 1/4 cup tamari dark soy mixed with
                        2 tbspns dry sherry)
  1         tablespoon  light oil
                        = (wok oil, peanut oil or vegetable oil)
  4                     scallions -- chopped on an angle
                        into 1" pieces
                        === DIPPING SAUCE FOR GYOZA ===
  3        tablespoons  tamari dark soy
  1           teaspoon  hot sweet mustard
                        = (from Asian foods aisle or other
                        prepared mustard)
  2          teaspoons  rice wine
                        = (or white vinegar)

Place 2 pots of water on to boil: 1 pasta pot with a few inches of water in it, 1 medium sauce pan with 1 1/2 cups of water in it.  Cover both pots and bring all the water to a boil.

When the smaller pot of water comes to a boil, stir in rice and return water to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer.  Place a colander over the pot and add the edamame to it.  Place the pot cover over the edamame nesting it in the colander.  Steam the edamame 5 minutes, then remove them to 2 small bowls, salt them and cover bowls with plastic or foil to keep warm.  Set colander aside and return pot lid to rice, stirring rice before replacing the lid.

While the edamame are steaming, before removing them to the bowls, you have a pocket of time to work with.  Add 1/2 cup, a couple of handfuls of Napa cabbage to the second pot of water.  Blanch the shredded cabbage 1 minute and remove with a spider or tongs to paper towels to drain and cool.  Chop shredded blanched cabbage.

Combine meat, chopped salad shrimp, sake, ginger, 1 scallion, 1 tablespoon tamari, sesame oil, black pepper and cooled, chopped cabbage in a bowl.  Place 2 teaspoons of filling on each won ton wrapper.  Wet your fingertips to help seal won ton wrappers.  The gyoza should look like small half moons.

Place 1 or 2 Napa cabbage leaves into the bottom of the colander.  The leaves will prevent your dumplings from sticking to the surface of colander.  Arrange dumplings on Napa leaf in colander and steam over second larger pot of simmering water.  Place large pot lid over the colander to trap the steam.  Dumplings need to steam 10 to 12 minutes.  While you are working on this, go back and forth with the edamame as necessary per above directions.

While dumplings work, slice the fillet steaks thinly across the grain.  Toss with seasoning and teriyaki or tamari and sherry.  Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add oil and the meat and stir-fry.  When meat browns at edges, add scallions and cook 2 minutes more, stirring frequently.

Use remaining raw shredded Napa cabbage as a bed to serve your dumplings on.  Plate all of your items on little dishes and in small bowls.

Mix dipping sauce of tamari, mustard and vinegar for the gyoza and set out alongside dumplings.

Warm or cold sake, leftover from cooking, is the perfect beverage and chilled navel oranges or tangerines make a refreshing end to this meal.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Place 2 pots of water on to boil: 1 pasta pot with a few inches of water in it, 1 medium sauce pan with 1 1/2 cups of water in it.  Cover both pots and bring all the water to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the smaller pot of water comes to a boil, stir in rice and return water to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer.  Place a colander over the pot and add the edamame to it.  Place the pot cover over the edamame nesting it in the colander.  Steam the edamame 5 minutes, then remove them to 2 small bowls, salt them and cover bowls with plastic or foil to keep warm.  Set colander aside and return pot lid to rice, stirring rice before replacing the lid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the edamame are steaming, before removing them to the bowls, you have a pocket of time to work with.  Add 1/2 cup, a couple of handfuls of Napa cabbage to the second pot of water.  Blanch the shredded cabbage 1 minute and remove with a spider or tongs to paper towels to drain and cool.  Chop shredded blanched cabbage.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine meat, chopped salad shrimp, sake, ginger, 1 scallion, 1 tablespoon tamari, sesame oil, black pepper and cooled, chopped cabbage in a bowl.  Place 2 teaspoons of filling on each won ton wrapper.  Wet your fingertips to help seal won ton wrappers.  The gyoza should look like small half moons.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 or 2 Napa cabbage leaves into the bottom of the colander.  The leaves will prevent your dumplings from sticking to the surface of colander.  Arrange dumplings on Napa leaf in colander and steam over second larger pot of simmering water.  Place large pot lid over the colander to trap the steam.  Dumplings need to steam 10 to 12 minutes.  While you are working on this, go back and forth with the edamame as necessary per above directions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While dumplings work, slice the fillet steaks thinly across the grain.  Toss with seasoning and teriyaki or tamari and sherry.  Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add oil and the meat and stir-fry.  When meat browns at edges, add scallions and cook 2 minutes more, stirring frequently.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use remaining raw shredded Napa cabbage as a bed to serve your dumplings on.  Plate all of your items on little dishes and in small bowls.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix dipping sauce of tamari, mustard and vinegar for the gyoza and set out alongside dumplings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Warm or cold sake, leftover from cooking, is the perfect beverage and chilled navel oranges or tangerines make a refreshing end to this meal.

  3                     thin-cut (3/4") New York strip steaks
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                jar  roasted red peppers - (18 to 20 oz) -- well drained
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Metal skewers

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Toast pine nuts in a small pan over medium heat until golden.  Place spinach, arugula, garlic, cheese, 2 pinches salt, a few grinds black pepper, nutmeg, and toasted nuts in a food processor.  Pulse grind the filling into a paste.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Remove 1/2 cup of filling paste to a bowl and stir in extra-virgin olive oil to loosen it.  Reserve remaining filling in processor bowl.

Place steaks between layers of waxed paper several inches apart.  Pound steaks with a heavy bottomed pan to 1/2 their thickness.  Season each steak with salt and pepper on both sides.  Cover each steak with a thin layer of filling and top with roasted red peppers.

Roll steaks tightly and cut each steak in 1/2 across.  Secure pinwheels with a carefully placed skewer and set 6 pinwheels on a baking sheet.  Drizzle with extra-virgin oil and roast 12 to 15 minutes.

Remove skewers and transfer pinwheels to dinner plates.  Top each with a generous portion of reserved sauce made from filling and extra-virgin olive oil, combined.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1 1/2         pounds  chicken tenders - (to 1 3/4)

Preheat a grill pan over high heat.

In a food processor combine onion, garlic and cayenne.  Finely chop the mixture by pulsing.

Heat oil in a small pan over medium-low heat.  When oil is warm, stir herb and garlic mixture into oil and heat 3 to 5 minutes, then remove from heat.  The oil will become infused with the flavor of the herbs and garlic.  Transfer to a bowl and stir in vinegar and salt.  Taste to adjust seasonings.

Cut chicken tenders into thirds and place in a shallow dish.  Wash hands.

Spoon half of your chimichurri over the chicken and coat completely and evenly.  Using tongs, transfer the bites to the hot grill and cook 2 or 3 minutes on each side.

Transfer bites to a serving plate.  Serve with party picks and reserved chimichurri sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LAMB ===
  2                     racks lamb - (abt 2 3/4 to 3 lbs total)
                        = (ask the butcher to trim and French)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  cranberry juice concentrate
  4                     tangerines -- zested and juiced
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  dried sweetened cranberries
                        =(Craisins brand name recommended)
                        === CHARD ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  5               cups  coarsely-chopped cleaned red Swiss chard
                        = (the yield of 1 large bunch)
  1                cup  vegetable stock
  2                     handfuls golden raisins
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === POLENTA ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             slices  pancetta -- chopped
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  quick cooking polenta
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage leaves
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10                    blades fresh chives -- snipped or finely
                        chopped

Preheat grill pan to high and oven to 400 degrees.

Drizzle racks with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill lamb over high heat for 2 or 3 minutes on each side.  Transfer to a baking sheet or broiler pan and place in hot oven.  Cook 12 to 15 minutes, to 130 degrees on meat thermometer for rare, 155 for well.  Let meat rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving for juices to redistribute.

For the chard, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil and the onion and saute for 2 minutes.  Then add the greens in bunches until they wilt down enough to fit in the pan.  Add the vegetable stock and raisins.  Season greens with salt, pepper and freshly grated nutmeg.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 10 to 15 minutes until greens are tender and no longer bitter.

Place cranberry juice concentrate and the tangerine zest and juice in a small saucepan and simmer together over low heat for 10 minutes.  Strain and return to pan.  Meanwhile, combine the cranberries and chicken stock in a bowl.  Cover and microwave on high for 1 minute.  Let stand 10 minutes to reconstitute the cranberries.

For the polenta, heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add oil and pancetta.  Brown pancetta a minute or 2 and remove from pan to a paper towel lined plate.  Return pan to heat and bring 3 cups chicken stock to a boil.  Add the polenta and stir constantly until mixture masses, 2 or 3 minutes.  Remove polenta from heat and stir in sage, butter, pancetta bits, and season with salt and pepper.  Reserve the chives for garnish.

Heat cranberries and stock to a bubble and remove from stove.

To serve, allow 1/2 rack of lamb per person.  Separate chops into 1 or 2 rib sections and glaze with cranberry-tangerine sauce.  Serve with sage and pancetta polenta garnished with chives and braised red chard.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === EGGPLANT AND ZUCCHINI TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped

Preheat grill pan to high or preheat grill or charcoal.  Coat tuna in balsamic and season with rosemary, salt and pepper.  Drizzle fish with oil, coating lightly on both sides, about 2 tablespoons oil, total.

Preheat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream.  Add garlic, onion and saute 2 or 3 minutes.  Dice the zucchini and squash while the onion begins to soften.  Add the zucchini and squash to the pan and turn to coat and combine with garlic and onion.

Slice eggplant into strips and dice, then add to the pan.  Turn to combine all of the vegetables.  Add thyme, salt and pepper to season the mixture.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, 10 minutes, until vegetables are just fork tender.

Grill tuna 2 to 3 minutes on each side for rare, up to 6 minutes on each side for well done.

When tuna is done and vegetables are fork tender, stir chopped tomatoes into eggplant and zucchini mixture and remove vegetables from heat.

Serve wedges of vegetable antipasto, above recipe, along side tuna steaks topped with vegetable salsa.  Extra antipasto slices and vegetables should be passed at the table.

A nice Sicilian rose, chilled, makes a fine beverage companion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  parsley leaves
  8                     garlic cloves -- cracked away from
                        skins
  1              pound  chorizo sausage -- casings removed

  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     fresh or dried bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry red wine

Remove steaks from pan and reduce heat to medium-high.  Add butter to the pan and the leeks, garlic, carrot, celery and potatoes.  Season vegetables with salt and pepper.  Add thyme and bay sprigs.  Saute veggies 10 minutes.

Add flour, cook 1 minute.  Whisk in red wine and reduce 1 minute.  Whisk in broth and bring to a bubble.  Stir in jelly.  Slide meat into pan.

When you reheat, bring sauce to a bubble and simmer 5 to 7 minutes over moderate heat.

Work on other dishes in your menu or dessert with the pockets of time created as veggies and meat cook.

Remove from stove top and serve each steak with lots of veggies and broth in shallow dishes with crusty bread for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === BROCCOLI ===
  2                     clusters of broccoli tops -- cut into spears
                        = (or 1 lb of broccolini, trimmed)

     1/2    tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  stuffing mushroom caps -- wiped with damp
                        towel, stems removed
  2                     fillet beef steaks, 1" thick
                        Salt -- to taste

Add the meat seasoned with salt and pepper and cook 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare, 5 minutes on each side for medium well.  Remove steaks and caps from the pan and cover with loose foil tent to keep warm and let juices distribute.

Add butter and flour to the pan and whisk in wine.  Scrape up drippings, reduce wine for half a minute, then whisk in a little beef stock.  Thicken sauce another half minute, then remove from heat.

To serve, top each steak with a mushroom cap and pour a little sauce down over the top.  Serve with the broccoli florets alongside.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  12                    crimini mushrooms -- sliced
  1                cup  chopped stemmed shiitake mushrooms
  1                cup  chopped oyster mushrooms
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Beat eggs with salt and pepper, dash of half-and-half and hot sauce.  Pour over the mushrooms.  Lift and settle eggs in the pan as they brown on the bottom.

When the eggs are set but remain uncooked on top, transfer to oven for 7 or 8 minutes, until frittata is golden brown and puffy.  Sprinkle the frittata with cheese and return to the oven for 1 or 2 minutes.

Serve frittata from the hot pan and cut into 6 wedges at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.
