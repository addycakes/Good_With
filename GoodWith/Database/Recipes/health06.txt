  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted stick margarine
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- diced
  1                     carrot -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (4 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                can  no-salt-added diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  low-sodium chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme leaves

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In a large nonstick skillet, melt the margarine.  Add the onions, celery, carrot and garlic; cook, stirring as needed, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables to a 3-quart Dutch oven or casserole.

In a gallon-size sealable plastic bag, combine the flour and pepper.  Add the chicken; shake to coat.

In the same skillet, heat the oil.  Add the chicken and brown 2 minutes on each side.  Arrange the chicken on top of the vegetables.  Return the skillet to the heat; add the tomatoes, broth, wine, parsley and thyme.  Cook, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until the liquid comes to a boil; pour over the chicken.

Bake, covered, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour.  Serve, sprinkled with additional minced parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (4 oz ea)
  1 1/2           cups  sliced mushrooms
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 1" strips
  1             medium  zucchini -- sliced
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  barbecue sauce -- plus
  2        tablespoons  barbecue sauce
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4               cups  hot cooked rice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Tear off four 12-inch squares of foil; place 1 chicken breast in the center of each.  Top with the mushrooms, pepper, zucchini and onion.

In a small bowl, combine the barbecue sauce and garlic; spoon evenly over the chicken and vegetables.  Make packets by bringing the 2 sides of the foil up to meet in the center and folding the edges over, then folding the edges of each end together.  Allowing room for the packet to expand, crimp the edges.

Place the packets on a baking sheet.  Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.  Open the packets carefully when testing for doneness, as steam will escape.

Place 1 cup rice on each of 4 plates; spoon the contents of 1 packet over each portion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut into strips
  4                     shallots -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
     1/4           cup  dry Marsala wine
  1                cup  seedless green grapes -- halved
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4               cups  hot cooked brown rice

In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil.  Add the chicken and cook, turning as needed, until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.

Spray the same skillet with nonstick cooking spray; add the shallots and cook, stirring as needed, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the flour; cook, stirring constantly, until the flour coats the shallots, about 1 minute.  Gradually stir in the broth and wine; cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes.

Stir in the chicken, grapes, parsley and pepper; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Serve the rice, topped with the chicken mixture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled gingerroot
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut into 1" pieces
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  oyster sauce or fish sauce -- (optional)
  4          teaspoons  canola oil
  4                     carrots -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  broccoli florets
  2                     onions -- sliced
  1                can  sliced water chestnuts - (8 oz) -- drained
  6               cups  hot cooked brown rice

To prepare the marinade, in a gallon-size sealable plastic bag, combine 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, the garlic and ginger; add the chicken.  Seal the bag, squeezing out the air; turn to coat the chicken.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight, turning the bag occasionally.

In a medium bowl, stir the cornstarch, the remaining 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce and the oyster sauce (if using) with 1/4 cup water.  Add 1 3/4 cups more water.

In a large nonstick wok or skillet, heat the oil.  Add the carrots, broccoli and onions; stir-fry until tender crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and keep warm.  Add the chicken and marinade to the wok and cook, stirring as needed, until the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.

Return the vegetables to the wok; add the cornstarch mixture and the water chestnuts.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens, 4 to 5 minutes.  Serve the rice, topped with the chicken mixture.

  2          teaspoons  canola oil
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     3/4         pound  cooked crabmeat -- picked over, flaked
  1                can  no-salt-added diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  salsa
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18                    cherry tomatoes -- halved
  8                     scallions -- sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3               cups  sliced mushrooms
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, squeezed dry
  2        tablespoons  minced dill
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6                     orange roughy or flounder fillets - -- (4 oz ea)
  12                    lemon slices

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, scallions and lemon juice.

Spray a large nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray; heat.  Add the mushrooms and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the spinach, dill and salt.

Divide the spinach mixture among 6 double layers of foil.  Place 1 piece of fish on top of each spinach mound; top with the tomato mixture and the lemon slices.  Make packets by bringing the 2 sides of the foil up to meet in the center and folding the edges over, then folding the edges of each end together.  Allowing room for the packet to expand, crimp the edges.

Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake until the fish is opaque, 18 to 20 minutes.  Open the packets carefully when testing for doneness, as steam will escape.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                            Lemon Caesar Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              large  garlic clove
  1           teaspoon  white wine Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  anchovy paste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
  7               cups  torn romaine lettuce
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- rinsed, drained,
                        and halved
  1              piece  parmesan cheese - (abt 2 oz)
  18                    Melba toast rounds -- broken bite size

In a blender or food processor, puree the lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and anchovy paste.  With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil (the mixture will thicken slightly).  Add the yogurt; puree until just smooth, about 10 seconds.

Place the lettuce and artichoke hearts in a large salad bowl; add the dressing and toss to coat.  Using a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan into curls; top the salad with the cheese and toast pieces.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving:  198 Calories, 9 g Total Fat, 3 g Saturated Fat, 9 mg Cholesterol, 370 mg Sodium, 21 g Total Carbohydrate, 3 g Dietary Fiber, 10 g Protein, 226 mg Calcium.

Serving Provides:  1 Bread, 2 Fruit/Vegetables, 1 Fat.

Points Per Serving:  4.

Comments:  This healthy take on a favorite Caesar dressing replaces the raw egg with yogurt and sacrifices nothing in terms of creaminess.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
     1/3           cup  shredded nonfat mozzarella cheese
  1                     plum tomato -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped lean ham
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     fat-free flour tortillas - (6" dia)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a medium bowl, combine the cheeses, tomato, ham and pepper.  Divide the mixture evenly among the tortillas; roll up and wrap in foil.

Place the foil packets on a baking sheet.  Bake until heated through, about 10 minutes.  Open the packets carefully, as steam will escape.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Serving Provides:  2 Breads, 2 Protein/Milk.

Points Per Serving:  8.

Comments:  These calzones also cook well in the microwave.  Simply place the filled and rolled tortillas, two at a time, seam-side down, on a microwavable plate; cover with plastic wrap and microwave on Medium-High 1 minute 20 seconds.  Either way you'll love them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  reconstituted dried mushrooms
  1                cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded and chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  seasoned dried bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
  1 1/2         pounds  London broil
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  dry red wine

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

2. In a medium bowl, combine the dried and fresh mushrooms, the onion, bell pepper, garlic, bread crumbs, parsley and thyme.

As though you were cutting a loaf of French bread, cut the beef lengthwise almost all the way through; spread open.  Spread the mushroom mixture evenly over the inside of the beef.  Starting from one short end, roll up jelly-roll style; tie the beef roll together securely with kitchen string.

In a nonstick Dutch oven or flameproof casserole, heat the oil.  Add the beef and cook, turning as needed, until browned, about 10 minutes.  Add the wine.  Bake, covered, until the beef is cooked through and tender, about 1 hour.  Serve with the sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1         tablespoon  orange zest

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  swordfish steak, 1" thick -- cut 4 equal pieces
  2                     lemons -- thinly sliced
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns dried rosemary)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, or prepare the grill.

Place each piece of fish on the center of 4 double layers of foil.  Top each evenly with the lemons, onion, rosemary, thyme, pepper and salt.  Make packets by bringing the 2 sides of the foil up to meet in the center and folding the edges over, then folding the edges of each end together.  Allowing room for the packets to expand, crimp the edges.

If baking, place the packets on a baking sheet.  Bake or grill until the fish is opaque, 10 to 12 minutes.  Open the packets carefully when testing for doneness, as steam will escape.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  sliced lean roast
  2               cups  torn romaine lettuce
  1              small  orange -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  pecans -- coarsely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  dried basil
  2              small  oat-bran pita breads -- halved

     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2          teaspoons  reduced-calorie margarine
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4         pound  cooked peeled small shrimp

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  red or pink salmon - (14 3/4 oz) -- drained and flaked
  2               cups  cold cooked brown rice
  1              large  papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  12                    romaine lettuce leaves

In a large bowl, combine the salmon, rice, papaya, parsley, lime juice, vinegar and pepper.  Refrigerate, covered, until chilled, at least 2 hours.

Fluff the salad mixture with a fork.  Arrange 3 lettuce leaves on each of 4 plates; top with the salad.

  1                     spaghetti squash - (abt 3 lbs)
  2                     carrots -- julienned
