                 Baked Brie en Croute with Tomato Chutney

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Cheese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen puff pastry sheets - (16 oz) -- thawed
  17 1/4        ounces  Brie wheel -- chilled
  2 1/2           cups  Tomato Chutney -- see * Note
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten

  * Note:  See the "Tomato Chutney" recipe which is included in this collection.

   On a lightly floured surface roll out 1 sheet of pastry 1/8-inch thick (about 15 inches in diameter) and, using Brie as a guide, cut out 1 round the size of the Brie.  With a 2 3/4-inch star-shaped cutter cut out 5 stars from trimmings.  Reserve pastry round and stars.

   Halve Brie horizontally.  Roll out remaining sheet of pastry 1/8-inch thick (about 15 inches in diameter) and transfer to a shallow baking pan, about 15 1/2 by 10 1/2 inches.  Center bottom half of Brie, cut-side up, on pastry in pan and spread 1/2 cup Tomato Chutney to within 1/2 inch of Brie edge.  Top chutney with remaining half of Brie, cut-side down.

   Without stretching pastry, wrap up over Brie and trim excess to leave a 1-inch border on top of Brie.  Brush border with some egg and top with reserved pastry round, pressing edges of dough together gently but firmly to seal.  Brush top of pastry with some remaining egg and arrange reserved stars decoratively on it.  Lightly brush stars with some remaining egg, being careful not to let egg drip over edges of stars, which would prevent them from rising.  With the back of a table knife gently score side of pastry with vertical marks, being careful not to pierce dough.  Chill Brie, uncovered, 30 minutes to set egg wash.  Brie may be made to this point 1 day ahead and kept chilled, covered loosely.

   Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Bake Brie in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden.  Let Brie stand in pan on a rack about 20 minutes for very runny melted cheese, about 40 minutes for thicker melted cheese, and serve with remaining tomato chutney.

   This recipe yields 15 to 20 servings as part of a buffet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     broiler-fryer chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs)
                        Melted unsalted butter -- for brushing chicken
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Watercress sprigs -- for garnish
                        === FOR SEASONING ===
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
                        (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
                        (or 1 tspn crumbled dried rosemary)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

   With a sharp knife cut along one side of the backbone of the chicken from neck to tail.  Spread the chicken open, cut along the other side of the backbone from neck to tail, and remove the backbone.  Put the chicken skin-side down on a cutting board, pull out the breastbone, and flatten the chicken slightly with the flat side of a cleaver or a large knife.  Turn the chicken over, cut a horizontal slit through the skin between the lower breast and each thigh, and tuck the tips of the legs through the slits.  Tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders and remove and discard the fat.

   Make the seasoning:  In a bowl combine well all the ingredients.

   Arrange the chicken in a dish and brush the chicken with the seasoning.  If time permits, let the chicken marinate, covered and chilled, turning occasionally, for at least 2 hours or overnight.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat it dry.

   Brush the chicken on all sides with the melted butter and season with salt and pepper.  Broil the chicken, skin-side down, under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat, turning and brushing with the butter, for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the juices run clear when a thigh is pricked with a skewer.  Transfer the chicken to a heated platter and garnish the platter with the watercress.

   This recipe yields 4 servings.

   Combine the egg yolks, champagne, and sugar in the top of a double boiler and whisk over simmering water (make sure the bowl does not touch the water in the bottom pot).  Whisk constantly until thick and foamy.  Remove to an ice bath and continue whisking until cool.  Set aside.

   Whip chilled heavy cream to soft peak stage and fold gently into custard.  To achieve the most volume, plan to fold in whipped cream just before serving.  Serve in chilled glasses layered with fresh fruit and/or sponge cake.
 
   This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Chicken and Spinach in Curried Pasta Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Lorna Sass
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Pasta                           Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  chicken broth or water
  3 1/2         pounds  chicken parts, preferably thighs -- skinned, and
                        well trimmed, (or 2 1/2 lbs boneless,
                        skinless chicken, cut into 1" pieces)
  2           packages  frozen spinach - (10 oz ea) -- rinse away any ice
                        crystals
  1 1/2           cups  thick tomato pasta sauce
  1         tablespoon  mild curry powder -- or more to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh cilantro -- for garnish

   Place the broth and chicken in the cooker.  Place the frozen blocks of spinach on top.  Pour on the sauce and sprinkle on the curry powder.  Gently stir the curry powder into the sauce.  (Do not stir the chicken into the sauce; the goal is to prevent scorching the pasta sauce on the bottom while the cooker is coming up to pressure.)

   Lock the lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to high pressure.  Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 4 minutes for boneless chicken pieces or 12 minutes for chicken parts.  Quick-release the pressure.  Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow excess steam to escape.

   Stir well.  Taste the sauce, and add more curry powder and salt, if needed.  Garnish portions with chopped cilantro, if you wish.

   This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  minced cooked chicken
  1                cup  minced celery
     1/4           cup  minced onion
     1/4           cup  minced pecans
     1/4           cup  minced cucumber
  2        tablespoons  mango chutney
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lamb rack -- split, chinned,
                        and Frenched
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  dried lavender
     1/4           cup  minced fresh rosemary
     1/2           cup  minced fresh thyme
                        Zest of one lemon
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === HIBISCUS GLAZE FOR LAMB ===
     1/2           cup  dried hibiscus flowers
  4               cups  water
  1                cup  sugar
  1              stick  cinnamon
  2             pieces  star anise
  4                     cardamom pods - (to 6)
  1              pinch  whole black peppercorns
                        === SOFT POLENTA ===
  1                cup  Come Una Volta brand polenta
  3               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  mascarpone
  4        tablespoons  Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  butter
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
                        === SAUTEED WILD MUSHROOMS FOR POLENTA ===
     1/4         pound  morel mushrooms
     1/2         pound  hen of the woods mushrooms
     1/4         pound  chanterelle mushrooms
  4                     shallots -- minced
     1/4           cup  pure vegetable oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

   For the lamb:  In a bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade.  Cut each 1/2 rack into 9 chops, yielding 18 chops (3 chops per person).

   Rub chops with the marinade.  Let marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours.

   Heat a saute pan and pour oil into the pan when it is hot.  Saute the lamb chops.

   For the Hibiscus Glaze:  In a non-reactive saucepan combine all ingredients.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for 1/2 hour.  Strain.  Return liquid to a simmer and reduce until syrupy consistency.

   For the Soft Polenta:  Bring water and salt to a boil.  Whisk in the polenta.  Heat to a very low simmer and cook for 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally.  Add the cheeses, butter, and nutmeg and season as needed with salt and pepper.  Take the polenta off the heat, wrap well with plastic wrap, and store it in a warm place.  The polenta will hold its heat for quite a while.

   For the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms:  Clean the mushrooms as needed.  Some can be brushed off, while others may have to be quickly rinsed in water and well drained.  Never soak mushrooms, as they will absorb too much water and become soggy when cooked.  Cook each variety of mushroom individually because they all cook at different rates.

   Heat a saute pan 2 for minutes over a medium flame.  When it is hot, add 1/3 of the vegetable oil.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they begin to brown.  Add 1/3 of the shallots and 1/3 of the butter.  Keep the mushrooms moving in the pan until they are just tender.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Repeat process for the other mushroom varieties.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fatty ducks
                        (or 4 sets of duck thighs and drumsticks)
     1/3           cup  kosher salt - (abt 4 tspns per lb of
                        duck, half for short preserving periods)
  4                     shallots -- minced
  3        tablespoons  minced parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme leaves -- crumbled
  1                     bay leaf -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  white peppercorns -- crushed
  2             quarts  rendered poultry and pork fat
  1                     garlic head -- halved, stuck with
  2                     whole cloves
  2               cups  pork lard for storing the confit - (only
                        if there is not enough duck fat)

   Quarter the ducks and remove the backbones.  Cut and trim off as much fat as possible.  Grind any excess skin and all the fat in a food processor, place in a deep saucepan with 1 cup water and render the fat (simmer it over low heat for about 45 minutes, uncovered), strain, and reserve.

   Cut each breast into halves with the wings attached.  Roll each piece of duck in the salt and place it in a large stainless glass or earthen bowl.  Sprinkle each piece of duck with a mixture of the shallots, herbs, and spices and scatter any remaining salt over the top.  Cover loosely and refrigerate 24 hours.  NOTE:  This may be cut down to a few hours if it is to be eaten within a week or two.

   Rinse quickly, then wipe the pieces of duck to remove all the salt, herbs, spices, and liquid.

   Heat the strained fat in a deep, wide kettle.  Add the duck, 1/2 cup of water, the halved garlic head, and enough rendered poultry or pork fat to cover.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Lower heat and cook at a simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the duck flesh can be easily pierced with a straw.  Do not let the mixture boil.

   Remove the duck, drain and discard any loose bones.  Strain the warmed fat.  Put about 1 cup of warmed fat into each of the bowls or mason jars intended for storage of the confit and cool in order to congeal the fat.

   Arrange the duck pieces in the containers without compacting them.  Strain the remaining fat, tepid but not hot, over the duck to cover.  The pieces of duck must be completely submerged in the fat.  Cover and chill until solid.  Cover with a layer of melted lard.  Cover tightly with a glass top or with plastic wrap and store in a cool place such as a cold cellar or the refrigerator.  Leave to ripen at least 1 month.  It keeps well for 6 months.

   To use the confit, set the jars or bowl in a warm oven.  When the fat softens, remove pieces desired.  Return jar or bowl to the refrigerator.  Be sure all of the remaining pieces are covered with fat.  The duck can be served at room temperature or warmed in an oven, then sauteed to crisp the skin.

   Quarter the ducks and remove the backbones.  Cut and trim off as much fat as possible.  Grind any excess skin and all the fat in a food processor, place in a deep saucepan with 1 cup water and render the fat (simmer it over low heat for about 45 minutes, uncovered), strain, and reserve.

   Cut each breast into halves with the wings attached.  Roll each piece of duck in the salt and place it in a large stainless glass or earthen bowl.  Sprinkle each piece of duck with a mixture of the shallots, herbs, and spices and scatter any remaining salt over the top.  Cover loosely and refrigerate 24 hours.  NOTE:  This may be cut down to a few hours if it is to be eaten within a week or two.

   Rinse quickly, then wipe the pieces of duck to remove all the salt, herbs, spices, and liquid.

   Heat the strained fat in a deep, wide kettle.  Add the duck, 1/2 cup of water, the halved garlic head, and enough rendered poultry or pork fat to cover.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Lower heat and cook at a simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the duck flesh can be easily pierced with a straw.  Do not let the mixture boil.

   Remove the duck, drain and discard any loose bones.  Strain the warmed fat.  Put about 1 cup of warmed fat into each of the bowls or mason jars intended for storage of the confit and cool in order to congeal the fat.

   Arrange the duck pieces in the containers without compacting them.  Strain the remaining fat, tepid but not hot, over the duck to cover.  The pieces of duck must be completely submerged in the fat.  Cover and chill until solid.  Cover with a layer of melted lard.  Cover tightly with a glass top or with plastic wrap and store in a cool place such as a cold cellar or the refrigerator.  Leave to ripen at least 1 month.  It keeps well for 6 months.

   To use the confit, set the jars or bowl in a warm oven.  When the fat softens, remove pieces desired.  Return jar or bowl to the refrigerator.  Be sure all of the remaining pieces are covered with fat.  The duck can be served at room temperature or warmed in an oven, then sauteed to crisp the skin.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  polenta flour
     1/3           cup  loosely-packed grated Montasio cheese or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

   Turn the heat under a 9-inch skillet to medium-low and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of polenta flour into the pan.  Immediately sprinkle the cheese over the polenta, distributing it evenly.  Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, running the edge of a spatula under the perimeter of the wafer as the cheese melts and hardens to loosen it from the pan.  Remove from heat and let it settle for 1 minute.

   Using toaster tongs or a large tweezer and a spatula, lift the wafer from the skillet and turn over.  Return to heat for 1 more minute.

   Transfer the cheese wafer from the pan to a platter.  If it should break it doesn't matter because you must break it up anyway to eat it.

   Ahead-of-time note:  The wafer will keep crisp for a few hours, but taste best the moment it is done.

   This recipe yields 2 servings.

   Peel and quarter potatoes and in a saucepan combine with enough cold water to cover by 2 inches.  Simmer potatoes 15 to 20 minutes, or until soft, and drain in a colander.  Return potatoes to pan and steam, covered, over moderate heat, shaking pan, 30 seconds to evaporate any excess liquid.  Force hot potatoes through a ricer or medium disk of a food mill into a bowl and beat in sour cream and salt and pepper to taste.

   Remove skin from duck legs and cut into 1/4-inch strips.  In a small heavy skillet cook skin in 1 tablespoon butter over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and transfer cracklings with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.

   Remove meat from duck legs and chop fine.  Add garlic to fat remaining in skillet and cook over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened.  Add meat to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through.  Stir in salt and pepper to taste.  Stir meat mixture into potato mixture and cool.  Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

   Put 1 wrapper on a lightly floured surface and mound 1 tablespoon filling in center.  Top filling with 1 parsley leaf.  Lightly brush edges of wrapper with water and put a second wrapper over first, pressing down around filling to force out air and sealing edges well.  Trim excess dough with a round cutter or sharp knife.  Make more ravioli with remaining wrappers, filling, and parsley in the same manner, transferring as formed to a dry kitchen towel and turning occasionally to dry slightly.

   In a kettle of gently boiling salted water, cook ravioli in 2 batches for 2 minutes, or until they rise to the surface and are tender.  (Do not let water boil vigorously once ravioli have been added.)  Transfer ravioli as cooked with a slotted spoon to a dry kitchen towel to drain and keep warm.

   While ravioli are cooking, in the small heavy skillet cook remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over moderate heat, swirling skillet occasionally, until nut brown in color.  Remove skillet from heat and stir in truffle oil and paste.

   Arrange 4 or 5 ravioli on each of 6 heated plates and spoon truffle sauce on top.  Garnish each serving with cracklings and parsley leaves.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

        Duck Salad with Raspberries, Oranges, Arugula, Cracklings

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  raspberry vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon-style mustard
  2        tablespoons  creme de cassis
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              whole  confit of duck -- the neck end and the
                        neck and giblets reserved for another use -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     navel orange -- peel and pith cut
                        away with a serrated knife, the fruit
                        sliced thin crosswise and halved
  1               pint  raspberries
  2            bunches  arugula -- tough stems
                        discarded, rinsed, and spun dry
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped scallion

  * Note:  See the "Confit de Canard" recipe which is included in this collection. 

  In a bowl whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, the creme de cassis, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.  Add the oil in stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.

   Remove skin from the duck.  Scrape off any fat from the duck skin and bake the skin in one layer in a jelly-roll pan in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is crisp.  Transfer the cracklings to paper towels to drain, sprinkle them with salt to taste, and crumble them.  Remove duck meat from the bones and chop.

   On a large platter arrange the orange slices, the raspberries, and the arugula decoratively.  In a bowl toss the duck meat, chopped, with 1/4 cup of the dressing, the scallion, 1/4 of the cracklings, and salt and pepper to taste and mound the salad on the platter.  Drizzle the remaining dressing over the arugula and fruit and serve the remaining cracklings separately.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  fruit -- see * Chef's Note
                        === FREE-FORM TART SHELL ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose bleached flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  baking powder
  7        tablespoons  cold, unsalted butter -- cubed
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose bleached flour
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  milk
  1                     egg
  1                     egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  soft unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  orange liqueur or Kirsch -- optional
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  apple jelly or apricot preserves
  1         tablespoon  water or liqueur
                        (or dust with confectioner's sugar in
                        place of glaze)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Toasted sliced almonds
                        or chopped pistachios

  * Chef's Note:  Any fruit normally served uncooked will be perfect in this type of tart.  Avoid apples, pears, bananas, peaches and apricots because they discolor, even when glazed.  The best fruit to use include berries, kiwis, oranges, seedless grapes, mangos, and papayas.

   For the tart shell:  Place flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Pulse 3 or 4 times to mix.  Add butter and pulse about 12 to 15 times until the mixture is reduced to a fine powder.  Do not allow to become pasty.  Add egg and liquid, and continue to pulse until the dough forms a ball.

   Remove dough from work bowl to a lightly-floured work surface and pat into a 5-inch disk.  Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and chill until firm before using.

   To make a free-form tart crust, roll dough to a 12-inch disk and transfer it to a parchment- or foil-lined cookie sheet, or the back of a jelly-roll pan.  Using a plate or cardboard disk as a pattern, trim the dough to an even 12-inch diameter.  Fold under 1/2-inch of dough along the edge of the dough, then flute the edge as if it were a pie, to make the edge stand up.  Use the thumb and index finger of one hand on the outside of the tart shell and the index finger of the other hand on the inside and pinch gently from the outside while pressing lightly from the inside.  Repeat all around the edge of the crust.

   Pierce the dough with a fork before baking.  Place the dough on the middle rack of a preheated 400 degree oven.  Lower temperature to 350 and bake for about 20 minutes.  Remove the pan from oven and transfer to a rack to cool.

   To make pastry cream:  Combine sugar, flour and salt in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart non-reactive saucepan.  Stir with a small whisk to mix.  Whisk in milk, then egg and yolk.  Place over low heat, whisking constantly, until the pastry cream thickens and comes to a boil.  Allow to boil 10 or 15 seconds, whisking constantly.

   Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla and butter.  Scrape the pastry cream into a non-reactive bowl and press plastic wrap against the surface.  Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.  Stir in liqueur just before using pastry cream.

   Spread pastry cream evenly on the bottom of the crust.  Arrange fruit in overlapping concentric rows, beginning at outside edge and working in towards the center.  For a "fruit salad" tart, toss fruit in a bowl with a drop of Kirsch (optional).  Pile the fruit on the pastry cream.

   Edge the crust with the nuts and sprinkle on fruit at the edge of the tart.  Either brush glaze on the fruit or sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.

   For the glaze:  In a small saucepan bring the preserves and water or liqueur to a simmer, stirring often.  Strain into another pan and return to a boil.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes.  (NOTE: If tart is mostly red fruit, use currant jelly and strawberry or raspberry preserves.)

   This recipe yields 1 tart.

            Garam Masala - (North Indian Dried Spice Mixture)

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  cuminseed
                        Seeds from 10 cardamom pods
  2          teaspoons  mustard seeds
  2          teaspoons  fenugreek
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  whole cloves - (heaping)
                        Three-inch cinnamon stick -- broken in half

   Heat a dry small skillet over moderately-high heat until it is hot and in it toast the spices in batches if necessary, stirring frequently and covering the skillet when the mustard seeds begin to pop, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are several shades darker and fragrant, being careful not to let them burn.

   In a mortar with a pestle or in an electric coffee grinder grind the toasted spices to a powder and transfer the powder to a jar with a tight-fitting lid.  The garam masala keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 month.

   This recipe yields about 1/2 cup.

   Heat a dry small skillet over moderately-high heat until it is hot and in it toast the spices in batches if necessary, stirring frequently and covering the skillet when the mustard seeds begin to pop, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are several shades darker and fragrant, being careful not to let them burn.

   In a mortar with a pestle or in an electric coffee grinder grind the toasted spices to a powder and transfer the powder to a jar with a tight-fitting lid.  The garam masala keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 month.

   This recipe yields about 1/2 cup.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh ginger root -- (don't bother
                        peeling it but give it a quick rinse
                        before chopping)
  3               cups  water
                        Honey -- to taste

   In a small saucepan, combine the ginger root and water, bring to a boil and simmer for ten minutes.  Taste and if it tastes too weak, continue simmering; if it tastes too strong add more water.  Strain and sweeten with honey to taste.

   This recipe yields 1 to 2 servings.

NOTES : The strength of this tea is a matter of individual taste.  Sometimes when I have a cold or the flu, I put a pot on in the morning and let it simmer throughout the day.  Every time I pour myself a cup I just add more water to the pot (the ginger root still has a lot of flavor in it).

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  baking potatoes -- scrubbed
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- or as needed

   Boil potatoes in their skins.  Drain and allow to stand until cool enough to handle.  Scrape skin from potato with paring knife.  Press them through a potato ricer.  Spread the riced potatoes into a thin, even layer on the work surface and allow to cool completely.

   In a small bowl, beat together the egg, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Gather cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the center.  Pour egg mixture into the potato well.  Knead the potato and egg mixture together with both hands, gradually adding the grated cheese and enough of the flour, about 1 1/2 cups, to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough.  It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work the flour into the potato mixture; remember, the longer the dough is kneaded, the more flour it will require, and the heavier it will become.  As you knead, repeatedly rub dough from hands and scrape it from the work surface back into the dough.

   On a flour-dusted surface, dust dough and cut it into 6 equal pieces.  Form dough into a rope.  Slice rope into 1/2-inch thick rounds.  Sprinkle rounds with flour and roll them into balls.  Hold the tines of a fork at a 45-degree angle to the table with the concave part facing up.  Dip the tip of your thumb in flour.  Take one ball of dough and with the tip of your thumb, press the dough lightly against the tines of the fork as you roll it downward toward the tip of the tines.  As the dough wraps around the tip of your thumb, it will form into a dumpling.  Set on a baking sheet lined with a floured kitchen towel.  Repeat with remaining dough.

   At this point, gnocchi must be cooked immediately or frozen.

   This recipe yields 1 batch.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     crepes -- see * Note
  3           packages  frozen raspberries in syrup - (10 oz ea) -- thawed and drained,
                        reserving 6 tbspns of the syrup
  1              quart  Lemon Sherbet -- see * Note
  1               pint  fresh raspberries
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

  * Note:  See the "Crepe Batter" and "Lemon Sherbet" recipes which are included in this collection.

   Fit each crepe into an ovenproof 1 1/4-cup glass custard cup and put a large ball of foil in the center of each crepe to keep it open.  Bake the tulipes on a jelly-roll pan in a pre-heated 400 degree oven for 5 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake the tulipes for 2 to 3 minutes more, to until they are crisp and golden.

   In a food processor or blender puree the packaged raspberries with the reserved syrup, force the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl, scraping and pressing hard on the solids to separate as much pulp from the seeds as possible, and whisk the raspberry sauce until it is blended.  Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the sauce onto each of 8 dessert plates, set a tulipe on the sauce on each plate, and fill each one with a scoop of the Lemon Sherbet.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the fresh raspberries over each tulipe and garnish the tulipes with the mint sprigs.

   This recipe yields 8 tulipes.

  4             pounds  mixed collard, mustard and turnip greens
  8                     bacon strips
  6               cups  water

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche
  6        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             ounces  caviar
  12            pieces  toasted bread - (long and thin)

   With a serrated knife, cut each egg shell about 1/2-inch from the pointed end.  Empty the raw eggs into a bowl and reserve.  Wash the egg shells (tops and bottoms) in warm water, then turn them upside down on a towel to dry completely.

   Over very low heat melt the butter in a saucepan just large enough to hold the eggs.  Beat the eggs with a whisk, pour through a sieve into the warm butter, and return to the very low heat.  Beat constantly with the whisk, gradually increasing the heat, until the eggs are thick and creamy, not solid.

   Remove the eggs immediately from the heat and continue whisking while adding the cream, shallots, chives, salt and pepper.

   Place the dried eggshells in egg cups.  Using a teaspoon, carefully fill each shell 3/4 full with the creamed eggs, then finish filling each shell with 1 tablespoon of caviar.  The caviar should be slightly domed on top.  Place the little top of each shell on the caviar.  Serve with toast.

   This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  chicken -- rinsed
  8               cups  chicken stock or 4 cans low-sodium
                        chicken broth -- combined with
  1                cup  water
  5                     carrots -- thickly sliced on
                        an extreme diagonal
  5                     celery stalks -- peeled, and
                        sliced 3/4"-thick on an extreme diagonal
  4                     leeks, white part only -- thickly sliced on
                        an extreme diagonal and rinsed carefully
                        to remove all dirt
  1                     bouquet garni -- consisting of
  1                     bay leaf -- tied with a few
                        Parsley stalks
  1              pinch  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon leaves -- crumbled, or
                        to taste, if desired
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
     1/2           cup  tiny star pasta, stellini
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped Italian parsley
                        === FOR THE GARNISH ===
  4             slices  crusty Italian bread - (thick slices)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  4             sprigs  Italian parsley

   Set the chicken in a deep soup kettle or large casserole breast-side down and add the stock or broth and water and 4 teaspoons of salt.  Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming the surface thoroughly.

   Lower the heat and add the carrots, celery, leeks, bouquet garni, thyme, garlic, and dried tarragon.  Adjust the heat to a low simmer and poach the chicken for 15 minutes.  Turn the chicken onto its back and continue poaching for 25 minutes more, or until it is cooked through.

   Transfer the chicken to a large plate.  Strain the stock into a large saucepan.  Reserve the vegetables and discard the bouquet garni.  Set the stock over moderately-high heat and reduce it by half.

   Meanwhile, when the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into large pieces.  Set the chicken aside, covered, in a warm place.

   In a saucepan of boiling water, add the pasta and cook for 5 minutes, or until al dente.  Drain and set aside.

   Whisk the butter into the broth and add the lemon juice and fresh tarragon.  Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Add the vegetables to the saucepan along with the chopped parsley and pasta.  Warm over low heat.

   Make the garnish:  Brush the bread with the oil and toast until golden.  Sprinkle each slice with 2 tablespoons Parmesan and set a slice on each of four deep dinner plates.

   Divide the chicken among the plates, spoon the broth, vegetables, and pasta over it and garnish each plate with the parsley sprigs.

   This recipe yields 4 servings.

   Set the chicken in a deep soup kettle or large casserole breast-side down and add the stock or broth and water and 4 teaspoons of salt.  Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming the surface thoroughly.

   Lower the heat and add the carrots, celery, leeks, bouquet garni, thyme, garlic, and dried tarragon.  Adjust the heat to a low simmer and poach the chicken for 15 minutes.  Turn the chicken onto its back and continue poaching for 25 minutes more, or until it is cooked through.

   Transfer the chicken to a large plate.  Strain the stock into a large saucepan.  Reserve the vegetables and discard the bouquet garni.  Set the stock over moderately-high heat and reduce it by half.

   Meanwhile, when the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into large pieces.  Set the chicken aside, covered, in a warm place.

   Pan-Roasted Pork Tenderloin Wild Boar-Style with Shiitake Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Marcella Hazan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  pork tenderloin -- cut into 2 pieces
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  very thinly sliced onion
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, and lightly
                        mashed with the flat side of a knife blade
  4              whole  bay leaves - (to 5)
     1/2           cup  finely-cut celery, both stalk and leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary leaves -- chopped
                        (or 1/2 tbspn dried rosemary)
  1                cup  red wine (juicy, fruity wine such as
                        Rosso di Montalcino)
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  butter

   In a deep rectangular or oval dish that can contain the meat and all the other ingredients except for the mushrooms, combine the pork tenderloin, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, onion, garlic, bay leaves, celery, rosemary, and red wine.  Turn the meat over several times to coat it well, then cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  Take it out occasionally whenever convenient to turn the pork over, basting it with its marinade.

   The following day, take the meat out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before proceeding with the preparation of the dish.  Turn it over and baste it when you take it out of the refrigerator, and once every half hour thereafter.

   Detach the mushroom caps from the stems, discarding the stems.  Wash the caps quickly in running cold water without letting them soak.  Pat them dry gently but thoroughly with a cloth towel, and cut them into thin slices.

   Lift the tenderloin out of the deep dish, pick out any bits of the vegetables from the marinade that may be sticking to it, and pat the meat dry with kitchen towels.

   In a skillet that can accommodate the two pieces of pork without overlapping, put in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, and turn the heat to high.  When the oil is hot enough to sizzle when you put in the meat, slip in both pieces.  Turn the meat over to brown it evenly all around, then transfer it to a platter.

   Pour all the marinade from the deep dish into the skillet, turn the heat down to low, and cover the pan.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are very soft or almost dissolved.

   While the marinade is cooking, put 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet, turn the heat to medium, and add the sliced shiitake caps with some salt.  Cook, turning the mushrooms over occasionally, until the liquid they shed evaporates completely and they have become very tender.

When the vegetables of the marinade are very soft, add the cooked shiitake mushrooms, cooking them together for about a minute or two.  Add both pieces of pork, sprinkling them with salt and several grindings of black pepper, and raise the heat to high.  Cook the meat for 10 minutes on each side.

   Transfer the meat onto a cutting board, cut into slices 1/3-inch thick, and place slices on a very warm serving platter.  Remove the bay leaves from the marinade -- and the garlic cloves, if you can find them -- then cover the meat with the cooked marinade and mushrooms and serve at once.

   Ahead-of-time note:  When the overnight marinating of the meat is complete, it would be desirable to proceed at once through all the succeeding steps, but if you wish you can stop a few hours in advance right after the shiitake mushrooms and cooked-down marinade have been combined.  Cook the meat, however, only when ready to serve, because it may dry out and become stringy if reheated.

   This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

   Transfer the meat onto a cutting board, cut into slices 1/3-inch thick, and place slices on a very warm serving platter.  Remove the bay leaves from the marinade -- and the garlic cloves, if you can find them -- then cover the meat with the cooked marinade and mushrooms and serve at once.

   Ahead-of-time note:  When the overnight marinating of the meat is complete, it would be desirable to proceed at once through all the succeeding steps, but if you wish you can stop a few hours in advance right after the shiitake mushrooms and cooked-down marinade have been combined.  Cook the meat, however, only when ready to serve, because it may dry out and become stringy if reheated.

   This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  2             pounds  peaches, preferably the aromatic
                        white-fleshed variety
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1 1/2           cups  Prosecco or other young, fruity,

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24             small  Italian prune plums or 6 red
                        or purple plums (or 2 cups chunky apricot
                        or cherry jam)
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1             recipe  Gnocchi -- see * Note
  6             quarts  salted water
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  coarse plain dry bread crumbs
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon

  * Note:  See the "Gnocchi" recipe which is included in this collection.  Prepare this batch without the pepper or cheese.

   If using Italian prune plums, halve them lengthwise and remove the pits.  Fill each cavity with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and re-form the plums by pressing the halves together.  If using larger plums, halve them crosswise, remove the pits and cut into 1/2-inch dice.  Toss the diced plums with 1/4 cup of the sugar.

   Prepare Gnocchi dough according to the recipe without the pepper or cheese.  Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.

   Meanwhile, on a flour-dusted surface roll the dough under your palms to form a cylinder 2 inches in diameter and slice into 24 rounds.  Flatten each into a circle 5 inches in diameter.  Place a plum or about 3 tablespoons of the diced plums or 2 tablespoons jam in the center of each dough circle.  Gather the dough up around the filling, enclosing it completely without tearing the dough.  Pat the dough between your hands to seal and even the gnocchi.

   Drop gnocchi in the boiling water.  Cook until the dough is tender, stirring gently to prevent sticking, about 8 minutes after they rise to the surface.

   Meanwhile, in a medium-size skillet, melt the butter and the bread crumbs and toast until golden brown.  Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon.  Transfer to a baking dish.

   Remove gnocchi from the water and roll in the bread crumb mixture until all are well coated.  Arrange on a serving plate and sprinkle with remaining crumbs.

   This recipe yields about 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2       large bunches  fresh tarragon - (abt 1 oz)
  1        large bunch  fresh chives - (abt 2/3 oz)
  1              large  shallot
     3/4           cup  fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar (not seasoned)
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SLAMON AND POTATOES ===
  2 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet with skin - (to 3 lbs)
  1 1/2         pounds  pink fingerling or other new potatoes
     1/2         pound  cooked sugar snap peas -- diagonally cut
                        into thirds for garnish

   Make sauce:  Pick enough tarragon leaves to measure 1/2 cup (do not pack).  Chop enough chives to measure 1/3 cup.  Coarsely chop shallot.  In a food processor puree tarragon, chives, and shallot with remaining sauce ingredients until smooth and season with salt and pepper.  Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring sauce to cool room temperature before serving.

   In a deep 10-inch skillet bring wine and water to a simmer, covered.  Cut salmon into 6 pieces and season with salt and pepper.  Submerge 3 salmon pieces, skin-side down, in simmering liquid (add hot water if necessary to just cover salmon) and poach at a bare simmer, covered, 8 minutes, or until just cooked through.  Transfer cooked salmon with a slotted spatula to a platter to cool and poach remaining salmon in same manner.  When salmon is cool enough to handle, peel off skin and if desired with a sharp knife scrape off any dark meat.  Salmon may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salmon to cool room temperature before serving.

   Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/8-inch thick slices.  In a steamer set over boiling water steam potatoes until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

   Spoon sauce onto 6 plates and arrange some potatoes in a circle, overlapping slightly, on top of sauce.  Season potatoes with salt and arrange salmon on top of potatoes.  Garnish salmon with peas.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

        Pork and Kielbasa with Sauerkraut, Mushrooms and Potatoes

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Lorna Sass
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork
                Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh (refrigerated) sauerkraut
  2               cups  chicken or beef broth
  1              ounce  dried mushrooms - (1 cup loosely packed)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- or more if needed
  2             pounds  pork shoulder (butt) or loin -- well trimmed,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  1              pound  kielbasa
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
  2             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" chunks
     3/4         pound  parsnips -- scrubbed, and
                        cut into 2" chunks (or use 2 additional
                        potatoes)
     1/2           cup  sour cream -- plus more
                        to pass at the table
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill -- for garnish

   Drain the sauerkraut and reserve the brine.  Taste the sauerkraut and, if you find it much too strong, rinse it until you like the way it tastes -- keeping in mind that the flavor will be diminished when it is cooked with the other ingredients.  Drain well and set aside.

   Heat the broth in the cooker.  Set the dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour the hot broth over, submerging them in the broth with the back of a spoon.  Cover with a plate and set aside until the mushrooms are soft, about 10 minutes.

   Meanwhile, rinse and dry out the cooker.  Heat the butter and oil over medium-high heat.  Brown the pork and kielbasa in 3 or 4 batches, about 4 minutes per batch, adding more oil if needed.  Set aside.

   With a slotted spoon, remove the reconstituted mushrooms from the broth and squeeze them over the bowl to catch the liquid they release.  Coarsely chop the mushrooms if the pieces are large.  carefully pour the broth into the cooker, taking care to leave behind any sediment on the bottom.  Set the cooker over medium heat and stir well to scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom.  Add the mushrooms and half of the sauerkraut.  Set the browned pork and kielbasa on top.  Cover with the remaining sauerkraut and sprinkle caraway seeds on top.  Set the potatoes and parsnips on the kraut.

   Lock the lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to high pressure.  Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 10 minutes.  Quick-release the pressure.  Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow excess steam to escape.

   Ladle out 1/2 cup of the broth and blend the sour cream into it.  Then stir this mixture back into the pot as you stir well to distribute all of the ingredients.  If you'd like a stronger sauerkraut flavor, add some or all of the reserved brine.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle lightly with dill.  Pass additional sour cream in a bowl at the table.

   This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                         Potato-Mushroom Galettes

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Dan Latham
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  4               cups  sliced mushrooms
  2              small  shallots -- minced
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3              large  Russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced lengthwise paper-thin slices
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

   Warm the canola oil and butter in large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook slowly, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms release their juices.  Continue cooking until all their moisture evaporates.

   Add the shallots and cook for 3 minutes.  Strip the leaves from the thyme sprigs and add to the pan; discard the stems.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Remove from heat.

   Place the potatoes in a large bowl.  Drizzle with the olive oil and toss until well coated.

   Place 2 medium nonstick saute pans over medium heat.  Place 1 potato slice in the center of each pan.  Use one-quarter of the potatoes per pan, carefully form circles of slightly overlapping potato slices around the center slices, letting them fall slightly over the edge of the pan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook for 4 minutes.  If any gaps form between the slices, patch with slices cut to fit the gap.

   Place 1/4 of the mushroom mixture in the center of each galette and evenly spread it out to cover the potatoes.  As the potatoes become soft and flexible, begin folding them inward so that they slightly enclose the mushrooms and form a perfect disk-shaped galette.  Cook for 25 minutes, turning occasionally so that the potatoes do not burn or become to brown.

   Serve once the galette is crisp and holds it's shape, warm or at room temperature.

   This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Risotto with Tomatoes, Olives, and Smoked Mozzarella

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Lorna Sass
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter or olive oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced leeks
                        (or finely-chopped onions)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Italian herb blend
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- or to taste
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (15 oz) -- with liquid
                        (or plum tomatoes coarsely chopped)
  2 1/2           cups  chicken or vegetable broth
     1/2           cup  pitted Kalamata olives -- halved
                        (or other Mediterranean black olives,
                        pitted and halved)
  6             ounces  smoked mozzarella -- shredded
     1/2           cup  pitted Sicilian olives -- coarsely chopped
                        (or other good-quality green olives,
                        pitted and coarsely chopped)
  1                cup  fresh parsley leaves - (loosely packed)
                        Salt -- to taste

   Heat the butter in the cooker over medium-high heat.  When it begins to foam, add the leeks, herbs, and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.  Stir in the rice and coat it with the butter.  Add the wine and cook over high heat, stirring, until it evaporates, about 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes, broth and black olives.

   Lock the lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to high pressure.  Lower the heat to maintain high pressure and cook for 4 minutes.  Quick-release the pressure by setting the cooker under cold running water.  Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.

   Boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the rice is tender but still chewy and the risotto loses most of its soupiness and becomes creamy and thick, 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn off the heat and stir in the smoked mozzarella, green olives, parsley, and salt, if needed.  Continue to stir just until the mozzarella has softened and the parsley becomes limp, about 30 seconds.  Serve in large shallow bowls.

   This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  plain sour cream
  2        tablespoons  drained bottled horseradish -- or to taste

         Roasted Game Hens Stuffed Under Skin with Herbed Ricotta

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Donato Magipinto
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  part-skim ricotta - (3/4 of a 15 oz
                        container)
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1                     egg yolk -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh basil
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated lemon zest
  2              small  garlic cloves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     Cornish game hens
  1 1/2          small  lemons -- cut into 6 quarters
  1 1/2          small  onions -- cut into 6 quarters
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Put the ricotta in a fine sieve and drain for 30 minutes.

   In a medium bowl, combine the drained ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolk, herbs, and lemon zest.  Put the garlic cloves through a garlic press and add to the mixture.  Combine well, adding the salt and pepper to taste.

   Rinse the game hens and pat them dry.  Season the cavities with salt and pepper and place a lemon quarter and an onion quarter in each cavity.

   Loosen the skin on the breasts by sliding your fingers under the skin, being careful not to pierce it.  Spoon the ricotta mixture under the skin (about 4 tablespoons of stuffing per bird).  Truss the birds.

   Place the birds, breast-side up, in a shallow roasting pan.  Pour the white wine into the pan.  Bake for 1 hour, or until the juices run clear when the hen is pierced in the thickest part of the thigh.  Remove from the oven, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest 10 minutes.  Discard the trussing string and serve with the pan juices spooned over the hens.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
     1/4           cup  cold water
  1         tablespoon  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  glucose or white corn syrup
                        (glucose is found in cake decorating
                        stores)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  glycerine
                        (glycerine is found in cake decorating
                        stores)
  1           teaspoon  desired flavoring - (vanilla will give
                        the fondant an off-white color)
                        Cornstarch

   In a large bowl (do not use metal), sift the sugar and make a well in the center.  In a small saucepan, add the water and sprinkle the gelatin on top to soften for about 5 minutes.  Begin to heat the gelatin and stir until the gelatin is dissolved and clear.  Do not boil.  Turn off the heat and add the glucose and glycerine, stirring until well blended.  Add the flavoring.  Pour into the well of sugar, and mix until all of the sugar is blended.  Use hands to knead icing until it becomes stiff.  Add small amounts of confectioners' sugar if the mixture is sticky.

   Form the mixture into a ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  Place in an airtight container.  This icing works best if allowed to rest at room temperature for about eight hours before using, particularly if the weather is humid.  Do not refrigerate.

   To cover a cake with fondant:  Dust a clean pastry cloth, or a smooth, clean surface, with cornstarch and roll the fondant with a rolling pin until it is approximately 1/4-inch thick.  Make sure that the fondant is large enough to fit over the top and sides of the cake.  Slide both hands under the fondant and carefully center it on top of a cake that has been freshly iced with buttercream.  (The icing makes the fondant adhere to the cake.)

   Dust your hands with cornstarch and smooth the fondant, starting at the top and working down the sides until the entire surface is even and flat.  Cut off the excess icing around the bottom of the cake with a pizza cutter or sharp knife.  Decorate the cake with buttercream or royal icing.  This fondant keeps a cake fresh for two days at room temperature.  Do not refrigerate a cake with fondant icing.

   This recipe yields enough icing for a 9-inch cake, 4 inches high.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced, plus
  1              whole  garlic clove
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  3                     anchovies -- rinsed, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             slices  French bread -- cut 1/4" thick
                        on the diagonal
  2                     hard-boiled eggs
  1                     Romaine lettuce head -- rinsed, dried
     1/4         pound  Parmesan cheese -- shaved very thin
                        with a potato peeler

   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

   Cut 3 cloves of garlic into 1/8-inch thick slices and reserve the 4th clove.  In a small saucepan or skillet set over moderately-low heat, combine the sliced garlic with 1/2 cup of the oil and cook for 10 minutes.  Strain the oil into a bowl and reserve the cooked garlic.

   In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard, add 1 teaspoon of the anchovy, and mash with the whisk until smooth.  Whisk in the garlic-flavored oil, the cooked garlic, and remaining anchovy.  Season with salt and pepper.

   Brush both sides of the bread with the remaining 1/4 cup oil and season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the bread in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted -- about 5 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, rub one side of each slice with the remaining raw garlic clove.

   Peel the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites.  With the back of a spoon or a rubber spatula, push the yolks through a fine sieve into a bowl.  Wash and dry the strainer and repeat with the whites.

   Choose 6 large Romaine spears and slice them crosswise into 1/4-inch thick ribbons.  In a large bowl, toss the remaining whole leaves with the dressing.  Arrange the leaves on salad plates.  Toss the lettuce ribbons in the residual dressing and set the ribbons on top of the spears.  Sprinkle with the whites and yolks and arrange the toast on the plate.  Top the toast with the Parmesan shavings.

   This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Rigatoni pasta -- cooked
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to taste
     1/2         ounce  porcini mushrooms -- reconstituted in
     1/2           cup  warm water -- for 30 minutes
  2              large  white onions -- sliced 1/2"-thick,
                        and cooked in
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- until golden
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced pancetta -- cut 1/2"-thick
                        strips, and browned
  1              pound  portobello mushrooms, or a combination
                        portobello and white -- stemmed, wiped clean
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  10            ounces  fresh spinach -- rinsed, stemmed
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

   Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat, add a generous amount of salt to taste and the rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes, or until the pasta is almost al dente.  Strain the pasta in a colander, rinse it under cold running water, and toss with 1 tablespoon of oil.

   With a slotted spoon remove the soaked mushrooms from the liquid and strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with dampened cheesecloth or a coffee filter into a bowl.  Reserve.  If the Porcini mushrooms are still dirty, rinse them and pat dry.  Trim the stems and coarsely chop the mushrooms.

   In a 2 1/2-quart ovenproof casserole set over moderately-low heat, melt the butter and add the onions, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the onions are golden brown and tender.  Transfer the onions to a plate.

   Add the pancetta to the casserole, increase the heat to moderate and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the pancetta begins to brown.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to the plate with the onions.  Add the Portobello mushrooms to the casserole, season with salt and pepper and cook the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until tender.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the chopped Porcini mushrooms, strained mushroom juice, onions, pancetta, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, and the heavy cream to the casserole and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until mushroom flavor is pronounced in the cream.  Add the pasta, spinach, thyme, salt, and pepper and gently toss the mixture with the remaining Parmesan.

   Transfer the casserole to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until cream is bubbling.

   This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
     1/3           cup  peeled, finely-diced shallot
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  truffle oil
     1/2           cup  grapeseed oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped black truffle peelings
                        === POTATOES ===
  4                     baking potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh chives
                        === FISH ===

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  butter -- room tempertaure

   Prepare the vinaigrette:  Place chicken stock in a saucepan and reduce liquid to 1/2 cup.  Pour hot chicken stock over the shallots in a blender and let sit for 3 minutes.  Add the vinegar and season to taste.  While the stock is still hot, slowly add the oil with the blender on medium speed to emulsify.  Add truffle peelings and blend briefly.  Keep warm until ready to serve.  Yields 1 3/4 cups.

   Prepare the potatoes:  Put the potatoes in a sauce pot and cover with cold water.  Add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil.  Cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes.  Strain the water out of the pot and mash the potatoes with the cream, butter, and salt and pepper.  Stir in the chives.

   Prepare the fish:  Place a saute pan over very high heat.  Season the fillets with salt and pepper, brush each side generously with butter onto the skin-side only.  Place the filet in the hot pan, skin-side down, and brown for 2 minutes over high heat.  Put the pan in a 450 degree oven for 3 to 5 minutes.  Flip fillet.  Remove and serve with mashed potatoes, green beans and truffle vinaigrette.

   This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Shrimp and Scallop Salad with Orange Sections

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Marcella Hazan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Scallops
                Seafood                         Shrimp


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1              pound  raw medium shrimp in their shells
  1              pound  bay scallops or sea scallops -- cut in half
  5             medium  oranges
  1               head  romaine lettuce
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

   In two separate saucepans bring water to a boil with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 tablespoons vinegar in each pan.  (If you don't have two saucepans, you can execute this step in two stages using the same saucepan twice.)  When the water comes to a boil, drop the shrimp into one pan and the scallops into the other.  Cook the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes, depending on their size, and the scallops for about 1 minute, until their color turns a flat white.  Drain immediately.

   Shell the shrimp leaving the tails on, remove the vein that runs down the center of the back, and put them in a bowl with the drained scallops.

   Peel 4 oranges with a sharp paring knife, removing the peel and the pith.  Slip the blade in between the sections to detach the pulp from the thin membrane that encloses each section.  Lift out the membrane-less sections and remove any seeds.  Set aside.

   Detach the lettuce leaves from the head, discarding any bruised or wilted leaves.  Wash the leaves in several changes of cold water and shake dry in a towel or in a salad spinner.  Cut the leaves into strips about 1/2-inch wide.  Cut the remaining orange in half and squeeze out the juice.

   Combine the shrimp, scallops, and orange sections in a bowl.  Add the orange juice, salt, olive oil, and liberal grindings of pepper and toss thoroughly.

   Choose a shallow -- neither too deep nor too flat -- serving platter.  Line it with strips of lettuce and top them with the shrimp, scallops, and orange sections, distributing evenly over them all the seasonings in the bowl.  Serve at once.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

   Smoke the tomatoes for 10 to 15 minutes on a home smoker.

   Place wine, shallots, and vinegar in a small pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is reduced to 1/2 cup.

   Core and quarter the tomatoes.  Puree in blender, then strain puree into the pot.  Bring to a boil and simmer until about 1/2 cup of liquid remains.  Whisk in olive oils and season with salt and pepper.

   This recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups of vinaigrette.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil or butter
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  8               cups  chopped, washed greens, such as collards,

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2                     green onions, green parts only -- minced
  1                cup  cooked spinach -- drained
                        (or 1 (10 oz) package frozen spinach,
                        thawed)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1               dash  hot sauce
  4              large  egg yolks
  5              large  egg whites -- cold

   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish or 6 (1-cup) ramekins and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan cheese.  Set aside.

   In a medium skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat.  Add the green onions and saute until wilted.  Add the spinach, herbs, and a pinch each of salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the moisture evaporates.  Remove from the heat and reserve.

   In a small sacuepan heat the milk over medium heat until small bubbles form around the edges.

   In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.  Stir in the flour and whisk until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes.  Do not allow the flour to brown.  Whisk in the hot milk, a pinch of salt, and a dash of hot sauce.  Cook, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and beat in the egg yolks one at a time.  Fold in the spinach mixture and stir in all but 1 tablespoon of the remaining Parmesan cheese.

   Put egg whites and a pinch of salt in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Beat until stiff peaks form.  Stir a large spoonful of the egg whites into the spinach mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites just until combined.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared souffle mold or ramekins.  Sprinkle the top with the remaining cheese.

   Bake until puffed and golden, about 30 to 35 minutes for the large souffle or 15 to 20 minutes for the small ones.  Serve immediately.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  truffle peelings
     1/4           cup  Madeira wine
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped carrot -- plus
     1/2           cup  carrots cut in 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
  1                     sachet, (10 stems parsley, 10
                        peppercorns, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, and
  2                     bay leaves tied in a cheesecloth bag)
     1/4           cup  rich chicken stock, (stock made with
                        roasted bones and stock in place of water
                        as the cooking liquid)
     1/4           cup  sherry wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  truffle oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             medium  leeks
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock, (you may substitute canned
                        low-sodium chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley
  6             pieces  skinless boneless halibut - (6 oz ea) -- cut neat squares
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  24                    truffle slices
  12                    fresh tarragon leaves -- washed, dried
  3        tablespoons  fines herbs, (equal amounts of fresh
                        chervil,
                        flat leaf parsley, tarragon, and chives
                        combined)
                        === CRISPY LEEKS ===
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  leeks, white part only -- cleaned according
                        to directions above, and cut into thin
                        strips
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

   Combine the truffle peelings and Madeira in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Strain through a fine sieve, separately reserving the liquid and peelings.

   Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the same saucepan over medium heat.  Add the chopped onion, 1/4 cup of the chopped carrot, celery, and sachet.  Saute for about 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the reserved Madeira liquid and stir to de-glaze the pan.  Continue to cook for about 3 minutes or until the pan is almost dry.  Add the rich chicken stock and cook about 4 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half.  Immediately strain through a fine sieve into a medium-size, heat-proof bowl.  Discard the solids.  Set the liquid aside to cool.

   When the liquid is cool, whisk in the vinegar, 1/2 cup of the remaining olive oil, and the truffle oil.  Season the truffle vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

   Remove the green part from the leeks (you may want to reserve this for making stock).  Split leeks in half, lengthwise, down to but not through the root ends.  Holding the leeks together by the root, rinse thoroughly under cold running water to remove all the grit.  Pat dry.

   Place the leeks in a medium saucepan along with the chicken stock, butter, minced parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until the leeks are soft.  Add the 1/2 cup of remaining diced carrots and simmer for 3 minutes.  Cover and turn off the heat, but leave the pan on the burner to keep the leeks warm until ready to serve.

   While the leeks are cooking, prepare the halibut.  Lightly season each piece of halibut with salt and freshly-ground white pepper to taste.  Place 2 truffle slices and 1 tarragon leaf on each side of the halibut.  Using a large pastry brush, very lightly coat one side of 6 10-inch by 10-inch squares of plastic wrap with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Securely wrap each piece of fish in an oiled plastic wrap square.

   Place the halibut in the top half of a steamer over lightly simmering water.  Cover and steam for 8 minutes per inch, or until the fish is just firm but slightly underdone in the center.  Remove the fish from the steamer.

   Whisk the fines herbs into the reserved truffle vinaigrette.

   Spoon equal portions of the melted leeks into the center of each of 6 warm dinner plates.  Unwrap the fish and place one piece on top of the leeks.  Drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and around the edge of the plate.  Garnish top with crispy leeks and serve.

   For the crispy leeks:  Add oil to deep fryer, or a 3-inch deep saute pan.  Heat over medium-high until very hot but not smoking, and add the leeks.  Quickly fry until the leeks are crisp, about 30 seconds.  Remove leeks from oil immediately.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.

   This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Pan di Spagna - (9" or 10") -- see * Note,
                        baked and cooled
                        Butter -- for the mold
  1              pound  ricotta
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
  3        tablespoons  Strega liqueur or other sweet liqueur -- plus extra
                        for sprinkling over Pan di Spagna
  1           envelope  gelatin
  1                cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  chopped, toasted slivered almonds
                        === MERINGUE ===
     3/4           cup  egg whites - (whites of 6 large eggs)
  1                cup  sugar

  * Note:  See the "Pan di Spagna" recipe which is included in this collection.

   Butter a 1 1/2-quart bowl and line it with plastic wrap.  Slice a disk from the Pan di Spagna and cut the rest into 2 large wedges.  Cut the wedges into thin slices and line the bowl with them.  Sprinkle with the Strega.  Reserve the disk to cover the filling later on.

   Combine the ricotta and confectioners' sugar in the food processor and process until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Combine the Strega and gelatin and allow to soak until the liquid is absorbed, then place over simmering water to melt.  Whisk the dissolved gelatin into the ricotta mixture.  Whip the cream and fold it into the mixture.  Fold in the almonds.

   Pour the filling into the prepared mold and cover with the reserved slice of the Pan di Spagna.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill until set, about 6 hours.  Invert the Zuccotto on the platter and remove the bowl plastic wrap.

   For the meringue, combine egg whites and sugar in the bowl of electric mixer and place over a pan of simmering water, whisking constantly, until egg whites are hot and sugar is dissolved.  Whip on mixer until cooled and increased in volume.

   Spread meringue on outside of dessert.  Pipe on a decoration of remaining meringue with a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tube.  Place Zuccotto in 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes to color meringue.  Chill before serving.

   This recipe yields 1 Zuccotto.
