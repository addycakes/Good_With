                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     wild turkey -- wiped dry with
                        paper towels and liberally seasoned with
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  butter
  2             medium  red onions -- roughly chopped
  8                     garlic cloves - (to 10) -- smashed
  6                     tart apples, such as Granny Smith -- cored, and
                        cut into wedges
  1                cup  unfiltered apple juice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  flour

In a large skillet, sautÈ onions and garlic in half of the butter until onions are translucent.  Pour contents of skillet into a large roasting pan.  Mix in apples.

Set turkey, breast-side down in pan, using apples and onions to prop up bird so that it does not fall over.  Add apple juice, wine and chicken broth.  Cover well with foil and roast in a 325 degree oven for approximately 10 minutes per pound.

When the meat thermometer reaches about 135 degrees, flip the bird over and remove the foil.  Remove the bird from the oven when the meat thermometer reads 145 to 150 degrees.  Set the bird on a carving platter.  Strain the liquid from the roasting pan through a strainer into a large bowl.

Heat remaining butter in a medium saucepan and whisk in flour to make a roux.  Cook for 4 to 5 minutes while stirring.  Gradually whisk in about 3 to 3 1/2 cups of the strained liquid (you may need to add additional chicken broth) until gravy is of desired consistency.  Season with salt and pepper.  Slice turkey and serve with gravy on the side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Overcooking a wild turkey will result in a dry and tasteless bird.  A farm-raised domestic turkey derives more than thirty percent of its calories from fat.  The wild bird has only 1 percent total fatÖquite a difference.  The best way to avoid overcooking any turkey -- wild or domestic -- is to use a meat thermometer and roast it with the breast down.  While most game cookbooks recommend removing wild turkey from the oven when the thermometer reaches 180 degrees or more, in my opinion this will ruin it.  Take it out at 145 to 150 degrees, let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes and enjoy a tender and juicy treat.

                Squirrel

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     young squirrels -- each cut 6 to 8
                        pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  8             slices  bacon -- chopped
     1/4           cup  onion -- sliced
  2                     celery stalks -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary leaves -- minced
  2           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1                cup  chicken broth
  4               cups  warm cooked rice

Combine salt, pepper, garlic powder and flour.  Dredge squirrels in flour mixture.

Cook bacon in a heavy skillet over medium heat until browned.  Fry squirrel pieces in bacon grease until medium brown.  Add remaining ingredients and reduce heat to simmer.  Cover and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until squirrel pieces are tender.

Serve with warm rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Anything fried, squirrel included, tastes pretty good.  The squirrels are first fried and then simmered in liquid until tender.  Young squirrels taste much better than old ones.  If you are worried about fat and cholesterol, eat a carrot.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  firm fish fillets
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  hot sauce -- or to taste
  1                     red bell pepper -- quartered
  1                     yellow onion -- cut thick slices
  1                cup  shredded pepper-jack cheese
  1                cup  cooked black beans -- warm
  1                     avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
  4        tablespoons  sour cream
  4                     extra-large flour tortillas -- warm

Combine salt, olive oil, lime juice, garlic and hot sauce.  Pour over fish in a plastic, glass or ceramic container, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Grill fish, bell pepper and onion over ash-white coals until lightly browned.

For each wrap, spread a tablespoon of sour cream across tortilla.  Layer equal portions of fish, pepper, onion, black beans and avocado in a rectangular mound on the tortilla.  Fold the bottom edge over and roll the wrap from one side, leaving one end open.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe works great with any kind of fish.  Don't feel like you need to stick to the listed ingredients for this recipe.  Anything you like in a burrito or taco will work great in this recipe.  If you cannot locate very large flour tortillas, allow two regular flour tortillas per person.  Be careful not to overstuff your wrap or it will probably split when rolled.

Description:
  "We used to call these things burritos before the marketing people
  decided that they could call it a "wrap" and make a big splash in the
  fast food market.  Call it what you like."

  2              whole  trout - (abt 16 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Juice of 2 lemons
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     thinly-sliced onion rings
  6             slices  tomato
  2             pieces  butcher string - (each abt 2 feet long)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Season fish inside and out with salt and pepper.  Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon into each cavity.  Pack equal portion of basil, garlic, onion and tomato into cavity.  Tie a loop around one end of each fish and make a few more loops around the fish, securing the stuffing.

Brush fish with oil.  Place on a medium-low heat barbecue grate for 5 to 7 minutes then flip over cook other side about 7 minutes more or until skin is crisp and fish is just-cooked throughout.

To serve, cut string and place fish on plate.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  When it's summertime and you really don't feel like heating up the kitchen, the logical place to cook your dinner is outdoors on the barbecue.  The recipe specifies trout, but this preparation works well with most fish.

When cooking whole fish, figure on about 1 pound per person after cleaning and removing the head.  If you are lucky enough to have caught a big one, place the fish farther away from the heat and take your time cooking it.

                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     wild turkey
  1                cup  Dijon mustard
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
  12            ounces  flat beer
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              small  onion -- finely diced
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  dried tarragon flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt

Split turkey along the breastbone and through the back into halves.

Combine mustard with remaining ingredients to make marinade.  Place turkey halves in a non-reactive container and pour marinade over.  Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours, turning occasionally.

Remove turkey and discard marinade.  Allow to air dry for 20 minutes before placing on the barbecue.  Cook as per below.  Allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The key to this recipe is the use of a real barbecue.  Now, I know a bunch of you think that your propane unit qualifies as a barbecue.  And I suppose that a Subaru Brat is a pickup truck, too.  To me, barbecue means smoke -- smoke from real wood coals or charcoal.  We're talking smoky flavor.  This recipe also works well with a smoker, especially a water smoker.  You can help keep your turkey moist by placing a pan of water somewhere in the 'cue when cooking.  Check it often to make sure the water doesn't evaporate.

I haven't included cooking times because it varies so much with the size of the turkey and the heat of the coals.  The best way to cook it is through indirect heat.  If you're using a standard kettle barbecue, get the coals white-hot, then move them to the outside edges of the kettle.  Place a pan of water on the lower rack and set the turkey on top.

The turkey is done when a meat thermometer reads 150 degrees at the center of the breast.  The legs and thighs will likely require additional cooking time.  I usually cut them off and start them at least one hour before I start cooking the rest of the bird.  You should do likewise.  To carve the breasts, remove the entire breast from the bone and then start slicing.

               Beer Poached Fish With Parmesan Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  beer - (12 oz) -- flat
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  4                     fish fillets, abt 1" thick - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Heat beer and next 5 ingredients in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Simmer for 10 minutes.  Add fish fillets in a single layer and simmer for 10 minutes (or a minute or two less for fillets less than 1-inch thick).  Transfer fish to a well-greased baking dish.

Increase heat under skillet to medium-high and cook until liquid is reduced to about 1 cup.  Strain contents of pan, reserving liquid.  Cool liquid in the freezer, stirring often.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and stir in flour, a little at a time, until blended with the butter.  Continue stirring until it is smooth.  Add cooled broth, a little at a time, to the flour and butter mixture, while stirring.  Slowly add cream while stirring.  Add cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce heat to medium-low and continue stirring until sauce is hot and smooth.

Pour sauce over fish in baking dish.  Place baking dish under a pre-heated broiler and broil until sauce is lightly browned and bubbly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Poaching is a great way to keep cooked fish moist and flavorful.  Food is gently cooked in liquid just below the boiling point.  You can poach fish in a covered pan on the stovetop or in the oven as in this recipe.  I've used this recipe with whole dressed fish and fillets of halibut and sea bass.

                    Black Pepper And Herb Goose Breast

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Waterfowl
                Wild Geese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     skinless goose breast halves - (to 3) -- butterflied
                        = (see comments below)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary
                        = (or substitute 2 tspns dried rosemary)
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme
                        = (or substitute 1 tspn dried thyme)
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  1         tablespoon  additional olive oil
     1/3           cup  beef broth
     1/3           cup  heavy (whipping) cream

Pat butterflied goose breasts dry with paper towels.  Combine next 7 ingredients and coat breasts evenly with the mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours.

Heat additional tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add goose breasts and cook on both sides until just medium-rare.  Remove goose breasts and cover with foil.

While pan is still over medium-high heat, quickly add beef broth to pan and stir with a spoon to loosen bits.  Reduce liquid by one-half.  Add cream and cook until liquid starts to thicken.

Slice goose breasts thinly and arrange on plate.  Drizzle sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Many game chefs follow the standard "stuff the bird with apples, oranges, lawn clippings, etc. and roast in a 350 degree ovenÖ" routine.  I have not had great luck with the roasting of the whole bird.  Yes, it looks pretty cool on a platter, but it doesn't really taste that good.  Here's the problem; by the time the inside of the breast is a delicious medium-rare, the outer part of the breast is cooked to medium-well and doesn't taste good.  The answerÖmake the meat thinner.

A Canada goose breast is a thick hunk of flesh.  Smaller species are not as thick, but most are certainly plumper than a mature mallard.  Before cooking, I often butterfly the breast so that the thickness is pretty much the same as a mallard breast.  This insures that the meat cooks quickly and the outside does not get overcooked.

Place the breast on a flat surface and gently place your palm over it (finger tips up!).  Run a knife through the meat, between the surface and your palm.  If you cut your hand in the process, you did something wrong.  As a matter of fact, before you begin, we'll need you to sign a waiver.

Butterflying normally means not slicing completely through the meat, but leaving a "hinge" at one end so that the meat can be opened like a book.  Go ahead and cut all of the way through the breast this time.  You should end up with two relatively equal-sized pieces and, hopefully, all of your fingers.  You can also lightly pound the meat between waxed paper sheets to make it even thinner.

Comments:  Many game chefs follow the standard &quot;stuff the bird with apples, oranges, lawn clippings, etc. and roast in a 350 degree ovenÖ&quot; routine.  I have not had great luck with the roasting of the whole bird.  Yes, it looks pretty cool on a platter, but it doesn&apos;t really taste that good.  Here&apos;s the problem; by the time the inside of the breast is a delicious medium-rare, the outer part of the breast is cooked to medium-well and doesn&apos;t taste good.  The answerÖmake the meat thinner.
</DirT>
<DirT>
A Canada goose breast is a thick hunk of flesh.  Smaller species are not as thick, but most are certainly plumper than a mature mallard.  Before cooking, I often butterfly the breast so that the thickness is pretty much the same as a mallard breast.  This insures that the meat cooks quickly and the outside does not get overcooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the breast on a flat surface and gently place your palm over it (finger tips up!).  Run a knife through the meat, between the surface and your palm.  If you cut your hand in the process, you did something wrong.  As a matter of fact, before you begin, we&apos;ll need you to sign a waiver.  Please sign hereÖand hereÖand I&apos;ll need your initials hereÖO.K, and one more right here.  Now, proceed with caution.

                         Blackened Fish Sandwich

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fish fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     sandwich rolls
  4        tablespoons  mayonnaise
                        Sliced tomato -- as needed
                        Shredded lettuce -- as needed

Coat fillets with melted butter.  Combine seasonings and dust fish in seasonings.

When skillet is very hot, carefully add fillets to pan.  Cook for about 2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets, or until charred.  Flip fish over and char other side.

Spread mayonnaise on sandwich rolls, add sliced tomato, lettuce and blackened fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Paul Prudhomme, the legendary New Orleans chef, is generally credited with bringing blackened fish to the American culinary forefront.  Although not as popular now as a when first introduced, blackened food is still a crowd pleaser.  The secret is to use an extremely hot skillet, preferably well-seasoned cast-iron and to cook the fish outdoors.  Blackening, when done properly, cause a great deal of smoke and may set off your smoke alarm.  If you have a high BTU portable burner, set it outside, fire it up and heat the cast-iron skillet until it is hot, really hot.  Use firm fish fillets with a medium to high oil content.  Salmon and snapper work very well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     young rabbits -- each cut 6 to 8
                        pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely diced
  3               cups  dry red wine
  1                cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     firm slightly not-quite-ripe pears -- skin removed,
                        cored and halved
  3        tablespoons  chilled butter

Season rabbit pieces and dust lightly with flour.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add rabbit pieces and brown each evenly.

Add wine, broth, vinegar, sugar, bay leaves, rosemary and salt.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add pears to the pan, cover and simmer for 30 minutes more.

Remove rabbit and pears and arrange on plates.  Remove bay leaves and rosemary from pan.  Whisk in butter until melted and spoon sauce over rabbit.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In most parts of the country, rabbit dishes are not as popular as other game animals.  Big game, upland birds and waterfowl seem to be to quarry of choice for most American hunters.  I suppose that doesn't upset the rabbits all that much.  I suspect they would rather hang out with their buddies than in your oven.

Cooked properly, rabbits are moist, delicate and meaty.  You can substitute rabbit for just about any recipe that calls for chicken.  As a rule, younger rabbits are better table fare than older ones.  I've had the best luck braising cut-up rabbits, usually with some kind of wine.  The above recipe is a good example.

                  Broiled Fish With Roasted Garlic Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fish fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  whole garlic cloves -- roasted
  1                     lemon -- juice only
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  olive oil

Season fillets with salt and pepper and place them in a lightly greased shallow baking dish.  Broil about 8 to 10 inches away from the heat source until lightly browned.

To prepare sauce, process the vinegar with the next 4 ingredients in a food processor or blender until well blended.  While motor is running, add oil in a thin stream until emulsified.  Season to taste with additional salt and pepper.

To serve, drizzle room temperature sauce over warm fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe works well with just about any type of fish, but I use it most often with striped bass and halibut.  In addition to broiling, the fish can be cooked over smoky barbecue coals or in a sautÈ pan with some butter and white wine.  The recipe calls for fillets, but smaller whole or halved fish work well also.

To roast the garlic, place the whole garlic cloves in a pan, uncovered, and bake in a 325-degree oven until evenly golden browned, but not burnt.  If you get distracted and burn the garlic, start over.  Burnt garlic tastes bitter, not better.

Categories    : Catfish                         Fish (Fresh Water)
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     catfish 1/4"-thk fillets - (6 to 10 oz ea) -- skin removed
  1           teaspoon  Cajun spice
     2/3           cup  cream cheese -- softened
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1                     green onion, white and green part -- minced
     1/4           cup  roasted pecans -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  dry cornbread stuffing -- smashed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season fillets with Cajun spice.  In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients.  Lay fillets flat on surface.  Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over each fillet.

Starting at one end, roll each fillet snugly and secure with a wooden skewer.  Sprinkle additional cornbread stuffing over top and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Remove skewer and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  I've used this recipe on a variety of both freshwater and saltwater fish.  The key is to make sure that the fillets are thin enough to roll up without a struggle and thick enough to keep from tearing.

Starting at one end, roll each fillet snugly and secure with a wooden skewer.  Sprinkle additional cornbread stuffing over top and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Remove skewer and serve.

Comments:  I&apos;ve used this recipe on a variety of both freshwater and saltwater fish.  The key is to make sure that the fillets are thin enough to roll up without a struggle and thick enough to keep from tearing.

                    Citrus Glazed Wild Turkey Breasts

Categories    : Main Dish                       Small Game
                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     wild turkey breast halves -- rib cage removed,
                        skin intact
  2               cups  diced smoky bacon -- cooked until done,
                        but not crispy
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2                     oranges -- peeled, seeded,
                        and segments chopped or mashed
  2                     lemons -- peeled, seeded,
                        and segments chopped or mashed
  2                     limes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and segments chopped or mashed
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  1              pinch  salt

Combine bacon and pepper and work between the skin and the breast meat with your fingers.

Combine garlic with remaining ingredients and bring to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened.  Allow to cool.

Baste turkey breasts with cooled glaze and place in a shallow baking pan or dish in preheated 375 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breasts.

When glaze is golden brown, breasts are close to done (internal temperature of 145 degrees).  Baste again before serving.  Slice meat across the grain and drizzle any leftover sauce over meat.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Contrary to what you may have heard, cooked wild turkey is not dry, but overcooked wild turkey certainly can be.  Use your meat thermometer and remove the breasts from the oven when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees.  Let the cooked breasts stand for a few minutes before slicing.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  fresh cranberries

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Add first 4 ingredients to a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add cranberries and simmer until cranberries soften.  Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  Adjust flavor to suit your own taste.  If the sauce is too tart, stir in a little sugar.  Too sweet, a little more vinegar.  You get the idea.

Season the duck breasts liberally with salt and pepper.  Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet.  Add duck breasts and sear on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Flip over brown other side until breasts are rare to medium-rare.  Remove breasts from skillet and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes.

Slice thinly across the grain of the meat.  Spoon a little sauce on each plate and shingle breast slices over sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  mallards -- skin intact
  2               cups  flour
     1/4           cup  garlic powder
     1/4           cup  onion powder
     1/4           cup  salt
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Peanut or corn oil -- for frying
  1                cup  plum preserves
     1/2           cup  applesauce
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar

Pat ducks dry with paper towels.  Combine flour with next 5 ingredients and season ducks with flour.  Heat enough oil to submerge ducks completely.  When oil is hot, about 375 degrees, but not smoking, add ducks, one at a time.  Allow a few minutes between ducks so that oil can maintain temperature.  Turn ducks over 1 or 2 times and remove after 8 minutes.

To prepare sauce, heat plum preserves and applesauce in a small pan.  In a separate bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients and then add to pan.  Heat until it starts to thicken.  Serve plum sauce on the side for dipping with ducks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The preparation works best with a high BTU burner (30K or more) and a large pot with plenty of oil, but it can be done in the home kitchen as well.

If you use a small pot, the duck will cool down the oil, so just do a little at a time to keep the oil from dropping below 350 degrees.  Making certain that the duck is at room temperature before placing it in the hot oil will make it is less likely to cool the oil.

The recipe specifies mallardsÖreduce cooking time by a minute or two for medium ducks and 2 to 3 minutes for teal.  You can improve the sauce by adding in some chopped fresh ripe plums.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    dove breast halves - (to 12) -- skin and rib
                        cages removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese
     1/3           cup  ricotta cheese
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  dried Italian seasoning
     1/4           cup  seasoned breadcrumbs
  40                    round won ton wrappers
     1/4           cup  cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  cold water
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped ripe tomato
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season breast halves with salt and pepper; broil until rare and then cool.

Add cooked and cooled dove breasts to a food processor and pulse until cut into pea-sized pieces.  Add next 6 ingredients and pulse until ingredients are finely minced, but not obliterated.

To make ravioli, place 1 won ton wrapper on a flat surface and spread a thin layer of the cornstarch mixture around the outside edges.  Place a small blob of filling in the center of the disc, about the diameter of a 50-cent piece and about 1/4-inch high.  Place a second won ton wrapper on top of the filling and gently press the edges of the top wrapper onto the moistened edges of the bottom wrapper.

Place the finished raviolis into a gently boiling pot of lightly salted water.  Use plenty of water and don't crowd the pot with too many ravioli at a time.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until raviolis are tender and translucent.

To prepare vinaigrette, whisk the first 3 ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Slowly add oil while whisking.  Whisk in tomato and basil and season with salt and pepper.

To serve, place 8 to 10 raviolis on a plate and spoon room temperature sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season breast halves with salt and pepper; broil until rare and then cool.

Add cooked and cooled dove breasts to a food processor and pulse until cut into pea-sized pieces.  Add next 6 ingredients and pulse until ingredients are finely minced, but not obliterated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make ravioli, place 1 won ton wrapper on a flat surface and spread a thin layer of the cornstarch mixture around the outside edges.  Place a small blob of filling in the center of the disc, about the diameter of a 50-cent piece and about 1/4-inch high.  Place a second won ton wrapper on top of the filling and gently press the edges of the top wrapper onto the moistened edges of the bottom wrapper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the finished raviolis into a gently boiling pot of lightly salted water.  Use plenty of water and don&apos;t crowd the pot with too many ravioli at a time.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until raviolis are tender and translucent.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare vinaigrette, whisk the first 3 ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Slowly add oil while whisking.  Whisk in tomato and basil and season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place 8 to 10 raviolis on a plate and spoon room temperature sauce over.

                     Doves With Raspberry Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dove                            Main Dish
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             whole  doves - (to 16) -- skin intact
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  raspberry preserves
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or substitute 1/3 cup red wine
                        vinegar)
     1/3           cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  olive oil

Season doves with salt and pepper.

In a large bowl, whisk together garlic, preserves, vinegar, onions and mustard.  While whisking, add oil in a thin stream until emulsified.  Place doves in bowl, toss to coat, cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

Bake, broil, pan-sear or barbecue until medium to medium-rare and still juicy in the center of the breast.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is so easy and yet so delicious that I'm almost embarrassed to share it with anyone.  I suggest that you play around with this one by substituting different vinegars, preserves, fruits, etc.  I like to marinade the doves for about twenty-four hours in the refrigerator, but you can get away with marinating for only an hour or two.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     duck breast half fillets - (to 10) -- skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        = (or good quality vegetable oil)
  2             medium  yellow onions -- sliced thick rings
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- sliced thin strips
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1                cup  flat beer
                        = (dark beer preferred)

Season the duck breasts liberally with salt and pepper.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over high heat in a large skillet and sear breasts quickly on both sides, but not past rare.  Remove duck and set aside.

Add remaining oil and onions.  Reduce heat to low and cook onions for 4 to 5 minutes.  Add brown sugar and stir to coat.  Cook until sugar has melted and has coated the onions, about 3 to 4 minutes more.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer until liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup.

Return duck breasts to the pan, cover pan and heat duck breasts to medium-rare.  Remove duck and slice thinly at a diagonal.  Serve with cooked onions and peppers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I recommend enjoying this recipe with a full chilled tankard of your favorite foaming ambrosia.  You may also try thinly slicing the cooked duck breasts and piling it onto a Kaiser roll with some of the onions and a little mayonnaise.

Season duck breasts with salt and pepper.  Combine next five ingredients in a non-reactive bowl and add seasoned duck breasts.  Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.

Remove duck breasts.  Reserve marinade.  Heat oil in a large skillet and lightly brown duck breasts on both sides, but not past rare.  Remove duck breasts from pan and set aside.

Comments:  By request from Sacramento's own Dave Meegan, America's premier game hog.  Dave and I enjoyed this spur-of-the moment duck dish along with a great bottle of Groth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon.  My memory is a little fuzzy, as was my tongue the next morning, but I think it went something like the above.

                               Duck Creole

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Waterfowl
                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  skinned boneless duck breast in 1" strips
                        cut across the "grain"
  3        tablespoons  Cajun spice
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  diced yellow onion
  1                cup  diced celery
     3/4           cup  diced green bell pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  chicken (or duck!) stock or broth
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried basil leaves
  1 1/2           cups  diced peeled tomato -- drained
                        = (canned O.K.)
     2/3           cup  canned tomato sauce
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  4               cups  warm cooked rice

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Season duck pieces with Cajun spice and add to skillet.  Sear duck evenly until well browned.  Remove duck from skillet.

Add butter, onion, celery and bell pepper to skillet and sautÈ until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.  Return duck to skillet and add Tabasco, garlic, chicken stock, bay leaves, thyme and basil.  Simmer for 1 hour, covered.

Add tomato, tomato sauce and sugar.  Simmer until duck is tender and sauce has thickened to your liking.  I like it about the thickness of a marinara sauce.  Adjust seasonings.  Serve over warm rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Making a traditional Creole, whether it is made with duck, chicken, shrimp, etc., requires a fair amount of time to properly make the stocks and slowly simmer the ingredients.  If I gave you the long version, most of you wouldn't bother to cook it so it wouldn't do much good.  Here's the simplified version that does taste great, but you can improve the flavor by making your own stock out of roasted duck parts and vegetables.  The recipe calls for "Cajun spice", but you can make your own by blending red, white and black pepper along with some onion powder, garlic powder and salt.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  duck breast half fillets -- skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  4        tablespoons  butter - (to 6)
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2               cups  quartered mushrooms
     1/4           cup  brandy

Place duck breasts on a flat surface.  Press your hand over each breast and cut into 2 pieces by slicing through the middle of the breast, between your hand and the flat surface.  The idea is to have 2 thin pieces of duck breast.  If desired, you can lightly pound meat with a mallet so that it is of even thickness.  Season sliced duck with salt and pepper.

Fry the onion in butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat for a few minutes until soft.  Add duck and cook each side for 2 minutes.  Remove pan from heat.  Combine remaining ingredients and stir into pan.  (Caution: Brandy may ignite and burn your face if you look into the pan.)

Return pan to the heat and cook for 2 minutes more.  Remove duck from pan when it is cooked to medium-rare temperature.  Continue cooking other ingredients until mushrooms are soft and just cooked.

To serve, arrange duck breasts on plate and spoon mushrooms and sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced boned skinless duck breast
                        = (across the grain)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced dried apricots
  1 1/2           cups  shredded green or Nappa cabbage
  8                     egg roll wrappers
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water
                        Oil -- for frying
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
                        = (Asian section of your grocery store)
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar or white wine vinegar

Combine sliced duck with next three ingredients and marinate for 30 minutes.  Drain ducks.  Stir-fry duck in hot peanut oil for 45 to 60 seconds over high heat in a wok or skillet.  Transfer to paper towels to cool.

For each egg roll, lay the wrapper on a flat surface.  Place about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the cabbage on the lower third of the wrapper forming an area of about 1 inch tall by 3 inches wide.  Arrange apricots and cooked duck on top of cabbage.  Turn in sides of wrapper to just overlap stuffing.

Begin rolling egg roll by starting at the edge nearest you and rolling away from you, like a burrito.  When you get to the edge, moisten it with a little or the cornstarch mixture to help it seal.  Place egg roll in hot oil, enough to submerse it and fry until golden brown and crispy.  Drain fried rolls on paper towels.

Combine sauce ingredients and serve with fried egg rolls.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR STOCK ===
  8                     duck carcasses - (to 10)
                        = (more bodies equals more flavor)
  2              large  carrots -- chopped
  3                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1                     yellow onion -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves
                        Pan spray -- as needed
                        Cheap red wine -- as needed
                        Cold water -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (a bunch of herbs tied together with
                        string)
                        === FOR SOUP ===
  1 1/2           cups  diced peeled carrot
  1 1/2           cups  diced celery
  1                cup  diced peeled yellow oniond
  2               cups  diced cooked smoked sausage
  3               cups  whole small mushrooms
  2               cups  cooked barley

Place duck carcasses and next four ingredients in a large roasting pan.  Spray contents with pan spray.  Place in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours, turning contents every 20 minutes until evenly browned.

Add contents of the pan to a large stock pot.  Pour some wine into the roasting pan to loosen any bits stuck to the pan.  Pour liquid and loosened bits into the stock pot.

Pour 2 cups of red wine into stock pot and enough water to just cover contents of the pot.  Add peppercorns and bouquet garni.  Simmer, uncovered over low heat for 6 to 8 hours, making sure that you keep enough liquid in the pot to just cover contents.

Cool to room temperature and pour contents through a colander covered with cheesecloth.  Discard stuff in colander.  Transfer liquid (stock) to a medium stock pot.

Soup:  Add soup contents to stock and simmer over medium heat until carrots are just soft.  Serve in bowls topped with cheese or croutons or both.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a good way to make use of duck parts that we usually discard.  You can also get rid of the root ends and trimmed pieces of carrots, celery and onions (even onion skins are OK!).  "Cheap red wine" should be dry, unflavored and unsweetened.  A big jug of burgundy works fine.

                    Duck With Horseradish Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Waterfowl
                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     duck breast half fillets - (to 6) -- skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  prepared (not creamed) horseradish
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  heavy cream or sour cream
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley -- (optional)

Season breasts with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and brown breasts on one side, about 3 minutes.  Flip breasts over.  Cook for 1 minute more.

Add wine and garlic and stir into pan to loosen bits of duck.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Remove duck and let stand for 2 minutes while finishing sauce.

Stir remaining ingredients except parsley into pan and cook for 2 minutes.  Slice duck, spoon sauce over and top with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Do you like the taste of a slow-roasted prime rib topped with a little of that creamed horseradish?  The pungent flavor of the horseradish provides a great accompaniment for a juicy slab of beef.  You get pretty much the same result when you pair a creamy horseradish sauce with perfectly cooked duck, goose or antlered game.  Not only is it delicious, but it is so simple that you will make this one again and again.  If you want yours spicier, add more horseradish or a dash of Tabasco.  Don't forgetÖif you overcook your ducks, they won't taste good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     ducks
                        Lawry's Seasoned Salt -- to taste
                        Lawry's Seasoned Pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  Jack Daniel's whiskey
  2               cups  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  Jack Daniel's whiskey
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  Tabasco sauce
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh garlic
     1/4           cup  minced onion

Season ducks with salt and pepper and place in a shallow dish.  Combine Jack Daniel's, orange juice and olive oil and pour over ducks to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, turning occasionally.

To prepare sauce, combine all ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes to blend flavors.  Season with salt and pepper and allow to cool.  Sauce can be cooled and refrigerated for a week or two.

Remove ducks from marinade.  Grill or roast until medium-rare.  Baste with sauce just before done.  Serve with additional warmed sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I know that many of you do cook your ducks whole, so here's a spirited recipe for your next barbecued or oven-roasted duck.  As an option, you may want to cut off the legs and roast them in sauce for a few hours to make them tender (covered, 450 degrees).  If you want to save some of the Jack Daniel's for drinking, you can forego the marinade and baste the birds with sauce while cooking, but thin the basting sauce out with some orange juice or it will burn and look ugly.

                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     duck breast halves - (to 8) -- skin intact
     1/2           cup  flour -- seasoned with
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- and
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder -- and also
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  3        tablespoons  bacon grease or olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  diced yellow onion
  1                cup  white wine
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  4                cup  quartered mushrooms
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
  1                cup  diced fresh tomato
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Warm cooked polenta
                        Grated jack cheese

Dredge duck breasts with seasoned flour.  Heat grease or oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, add breasts, skin-side down and cook until skin is crisp, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Flip breasts over and add garlic and onion.  Cook for 3 minutes.

Add wine and half of chicken broth, bring to a boil and reduce liquid to about 1 cup.  Add remaining broth, cover and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.  Add additional wine if liquid evaporates too fast.  Liquid should be at least 1/2 inch deep.

Stir in mushrooms and basil and cook until mushrooms are just tender.  Add tomato and heat to warm.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve cooked duck breasts over polenta and top with cheese before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I prefer the traditional soft, moist version of polenta to the trendier firm variety.  This recipe strays from my usual "fast and hot" method of cooking ducks, but it still tastes like duck.

Polenta is available at most major grocery stores.  It is very easy to make, just follow the directions on the bag.

     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  liquid hickory smoke flavoring
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  2         tablespoon  cream sherry
     1/4      teaspoon  red chili flakes

Combine all ingredients and meat into a zip lock bag.  Refrigerate overnight, knead and turn bags several times during marinating process to mix in.  Drain off liquids and put into dehydrator.  Follow dehydrator instructions or to your meat textured liking.

If you don't have a dehydrator, you can turn your oven on to 150 to 200 degrees and dry for 5 to 7 hours or until meat feels hard, pat off excess fat beads and let cool.  When using the oven, prop the door open slightly with a wooden spoon to allow moisture to escape.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Just when I was trying to develop a good duck jerky recipe, along comes Ed Broskey, one of our The Sporting Chef friends.  Seems Ed had a few duck breasts on hand and he figured out a way to use them up, presumably so that he could go shoot some more.  Ed claims that he has picked up a few good ideas from the SportingChef.com pages and we're glad he was able to return the favor.

Ed offers this tip -- try slicing the breasts with an electric knife when still a bit frozen.  It will keep the slices more uniform and won't tear up the meat.  We both agree that this recipe would work great with just about any type of wild game.  Ed has tried it with both goose and venison.  Thanks for sharing Ed.

                    Elk Loin With Asian Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  elk loin -- all fat, gristle
                        and silver skin carefully removed
                        === ASIAN BARBECUE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  grainy or Dijon mustard
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  dark molasses
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
     1/4      teaspoon  red chili flakes

Combine all barbecue sauce ingredients and mix well.  Place elk loin in a zipper-lock bag and our all but 1/2 cup of sauce into bag with elk.  Squeeze out air and close securely.  Let meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Place marinated elk on a medium-hot grill and cook evenly until medium-rare.

To serve, slice across the grain into medallions and serve with sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Marinate your elk loin for just about 30 minutes in this spirited Asian marinade and sauce.  You don't want to mask the flavors of the elk, just enhance them.  If you don't have an elk loin handy, try this sauce with waterfowl, wild pig or any antlered game.

                               Elk Tostada

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  pulled cooked elk roast meat -- warm, (see comments)
  4              large  corn tortillas -- deep-fried till
                        crisp
  2               cups  cooked black beans
  6               cups  thinly-chopped romaine or iceberg lettuce
  8                     thin slices red onion
  2               cups  grated pepper jack cheese
     1/2           cup  chopped black olives
  1 1/2           cups  red or green salsa
     1/4           cup  sour cream

For each serving, place a tortilla on a plate.  Top with 1/2 cup black beans, 1 1/2 cups lettuce, 1 cup shredded elk, 2 slices red onion, 1/2 cup cheese, 2 tablespoons olives, some salsa and a dollop of sour cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Here's a way to make good use of antlered game neck and shoulder roasts.  I like to season the meat liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder and maybe some hickory or mesquite powder and then slow-roast them either in a conventional oven or, even better, a smoky barbecue.  Once the meat is evenly browned and thoroughly cooked, it begins to pull away from the bone and gristle with ease.

Your cooking time will vary according to the temperature and type of roasting apparatus used.  As a general rule, an average elk shoulder roast will take about 3 to 4 hours at 350 degrees.  Keep checking on the roast by pulling the meat from the roast.  When it comes off easily, remove the roast from the oven and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes before pulling the meat.

                           Elk With Barley Soup

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  elk meat -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- diced
  4                     celery stalks -- diced
  3                     carrots -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             quarts  game broth or beef broth
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- (optional)
  3               cups  cooked barley
                        = (prepare as per package)

Season meat liberally with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat, add meat and brown evenly.  Add onion, celery, carrots and garlic.  Cook 5 minutes or until onions are translucent.

Add broth and rosemary and cook over medium heat until meat is soft.  Depending on the cut of meat, it may take an hour or two.  Remove rosemary and stir in barley.  Serve with warm bread or croutons.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  I look forward to cold weather here in northern California so that I can enjoy a steaming bowl of soup.  Any antlered game animal will do.  Also, try this recipe with ducks or geese, but save it for less than premium species like divers and snow geese.  I cannot overemphasize how much better the soup will taste if you make your own broth or stock from the carcasses and trim of your animals.  Roast 'em with some vegetables and throw everything into a pot.  Cover it with water, bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for 5 to 6 hours or, better yet, overnight.  Save the liquid and discard the rest.

This recipe calls for onions, carrots and celery, but you can use whatever vegetables you have lying around.  If you can't find barley, use rice, pasta or potatoes.  I like to serve it with homemade croutons topped with some melted bleu cheese.

                        Elk With Black Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  bite-sized elk hindquarter roast pieces -- see * Note
                        Lawry's Seasoned Pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              quart  beef broth
  3               cups  black beans -- soaked overnight
  1                     yellow onion -- roughly chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  plum preserves
  1         tablespoon  minced pickled or fresh ginger - (to 2)
  6               cups  warm cooked rice - (to 8)

* Note:  Trim roast of all fat and gristle and cut meat into bite-sized pieces (measure the diameter of your mouth and divide by 2 to determine exact size).

Season meat with pepper.

Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat, add meat and brown evenly.  Add beef broth and beans to pot and add enough water so that liquid is about one inch over contents.  Add onion and garlic, bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 2 to 3 hours.

Add additional liquid if necessary to cook beans and soften meat.  Check the meat for doneness by squeezing gently.  When ready for the next step, the meat should start to break apart with your fingers.  Play with your food, go on, it's O.K.

Strain out all but about 1 cup of liquid from the pot.  Add remaining ingredients except rice.  Simmer for 5 minutes to blend flavors.  Adjust seasonings if desired.  Serve over rice.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Billings, Montana...enjoying incredible early Fall weather in one of our most beautiful states.  I'm working my way, preparing wild game dinners, from Bozeman to Billings to Fairmont Hot Springs and, finally, to Missoula.  Elk season is in full swing and I'm being bombarded with requests for recipes.  It seems that just about everyone in Montana has a refrigerator full of elk.

I know we like to shoot the big bulls, but they are obviously not the best table fare as compared to a younger animal.  When you've taken all the necessary steps to ensure that your trophy elk will eat well (trim the silver skin and gristle, don't overcook it, blah, blah, blah) and it's still tough, it's time for some slow-cooking.

For this recipe, the meat should be carefully cleaned and trimmed before cutting into cubes.  Play around with the ingredients until it tastes good to you.  I normally adjust with a little extra rice vinegar, soy sauce and/or plum preserves.

Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat, add meat and brown evenly.  Add beef broth and beans to pot and add enough water so that liquid is about one inch over contents.  Add onion and garlic, bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 2 to 3 hours.

Add additional liquid if necessary to cook beans and soften meat.  Check the meat for doneness by squeezing gently.  When ready for the next step, the meat should start to break apart with your fingers.  Play with your food, go on, it&apos;s O.K.

Strain out all but about 1 cup of liquid from the pot.  Add remaining ingredients except rice.  Simmer for 5 minutes to blend flavors.  Adjust seasonings if desired.  Serve over rice.

Comments:  Billings, Montana...enjoying incredible early Fall weather in one of our most beautiful states.  I&apos;m working my way, preparing wild game dinners, from Bozeman to Billings to Fairmont Hot Springs and, finally, to Missoula.  Elk season is in full swing and I&apos;m being bombarded with requests for recipes.  It seems that just about everyone in Montana has a refrigerator full of elk.

                     Elk With Lemon And Garlic Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  elk loin - (to 2 1/2) -- cut 2" cubes
                        = (or any hindquarter cuts)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6        tablespoons  butter -- cut 6 equal pieces
  8                     garlic cloves - (to 12) -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
                        Juice of 1 lemon

Season meat with a little salt and lots of pepper.  Let stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.  Add elk and sear evenly on all sides, but not past rare!

Reduce heat to medium and then add 2 tablespoons of the butter, garlic and brown sugar.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes.

Increase heat to medium-high, then add wine while scraping pan with a wooden spoon.

Return elk to pan, cook to medium-rare while reducing wine to about 2 tablespoons.  Add lemon juice and remove pan from heat.  Whisk in remaining butter, 2 to 3 pieces at a time until melted.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Anyone who pays much attention to my recipes knows that I have a thing for cooking fish and game with garlic and alcohol.  They all just seem to go well together.  I also prefer simple, rather than complicated recipes and try to get by with as few ingredients as possible.  The above recipe fits this criteria.  Do remember to take a few extra minutes to carefully trim your elk and remove all fat, gristle and silver skin.

                 Elk With Red Pepper Sauce And Basil Oil

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  elk loin or tenderloin - (to 2 1/2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === RED PEPPER SAUCE ===
  1              small  onion -- cut medium dice
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  roasted red bell peppers
                        = (do it yourself [best] or
                        buy them already roasted)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or substitute red wine vinegar)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BASIL OIL ===
  1                     handful fresh basil leaves
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
     2/3          cups  olive oil
                        = (extra virgin works best here)

I have not specified how you should cook the meat.  That part is incidental.  You can pan-sear, broil, grill or roast.

Red Pepper Sauce:  SautÈ the onion in the olive oil over medium heat in a medium saucepan.  Add the peppers, pepper flakes and vinegar.  Cook for 2 minutes more.  Cool and puree in a blender or food processor.  Season with salt and pepper.

Basil Oil:  Add all ingredients to a blender or food processor and process until smooth.  Keep at room temperature.  Whisk vigorously before serving.

To serve, spoon some of the red sauce on one side of the plate.  Spoon some of the green sauce on the other.  Place some potatoes (or rice, etc.) on the center of the plate and add a few vegetables for color.  Place the meat on top of the potatoes and garnish with something green.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  O.K., let's suppose that you live in a small town and you don't have access to much in the way of "gourmet" ingredients, but you do have a hunk of elk in the freezer and there's a couple of folks you would like to impress.  If you can't find roasted red peppers in a jar, try pimentos, they're not as hard to find.  If you can't find fresh basil, use parsley or, if you must, some dried basil instead.  You'll still have a dish with striking presentation, great flavor and, if the boss is coming over, you may just get that raise you should have gotten a long time ago.

If you don't have an elk in the freezer, any hunk of relatively tender meat will do.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Breasts from 3 large ducks or 2 geese -- slow cooked,
                        deboned, and minced
                        Broth from cooking fowl -- strained
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  5        tablespoons  Old Bay Seasoning
  1         tablespoon  oregano
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  MSG
  3        tablespoons  file' powder
  5                     bay leaves
  4              large  yellow onions -- chopped
  1              bunch  green onions -- chopped
  3                     red bell peppers -- chopped
  1                cup  bacon drippings
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  20            ounces  cut okra
  2             pounds  cooked shrimp -- shelled
  1 1/2         pounds  andouille or kielbasa -- sliced

Add 8 cups broth to two-gallon pot.  Save stock remainder for adding later in case you like your gumbo thinner.

Mix seasonings.  Add vegetables (except okra) and seasonings to broth.  Stir well.  Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer covered until onions are translucent.  Remove from heat.

In heavy skillet, heat drippings and slowly whisk in flour.  Stir constantly over low-medium heat until roux is a dark-chocolate brown.  Take care not to burn roux.  Use spatula to constantly scrape skillet.  If roux begins to smoke, continue stirring but remove from heat until smoking stops, then return to heat.  Be patient.  This process can take 30 to 45 minutes.  Remember that a burned roux will ruin your gumbo.

Remove roux from heat.  Let cool for 10 minutes.  Add 2 to 3 handfuls of fowl to cool a bit more.  Add roux to pot.  Mix well.  Stir in remaining fowl, okra, and andouille.  Simmer 30 minutes or until okra is tender.  Add shrimp.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes.

Serve with rice.  Freezes well.

This recipe yields 2 gallons.

Add 8 cups broth to two-gallon pot.  Save stock remainder for adding later in case you like your gumbo thinner.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix seasonings.  Add vegetables (except okra) and seasonings to broth.  Stir well.  Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer covered until onions are translucent.  Remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In heavy skillet, heat drippings and slowly whisk in flour.  Stir constantly over low-medium heat until roux is a dark-chocolate brown.  Take care not to burn roux.  Use spatula to constantly scrape skillet.  If roux begins to smoke, continue stirring but remove from heat until smoking stops, then return to heat.  Be patient.  This process can take 30 to 45 minutes.  Remember that a burned roux will ruin your gumbo.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove roux from heat.  Let cool for 10 minutes.  Add 2 to 3 handfuls of fowl to cool a bit more.  Add roux to pot.  Mix well.  Stir in remaining fowl, okra, and andouille.  Simmer 30 minutes or until okra is tender.  Add shrimp.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with rice.  Freezes well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 gallons.

                   Fish With Green Coconut Curry Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fish fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  minced yellow onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
                        = (Asian section of your market)
  1         tablespoon  low-salt soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced peeled fresh gingerroot
  1                cup  coconut milk
     1/2      teaspoon  green curry paste
                        = (you can always add more)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  light brown sugar
  2                     green onions, white and green part -- chopped

Season fish with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet and add fish.  Lightly brown fish on one side.  Flip fish over and cook for 1 minute.

Add onion, garlic, fish sauce and soy sauce.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.  Add coconut milk and ginger.  Remove fish when just cooked and keep warm.

Stir in curry paste, lime juice, brown sugar and green onion.  Heat to a boil.  Taste the sauce.  If you want it hotter, add a little more curry paste.

To serve, arrange fish on plates and spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you are not a big fan of the standard Indian yellow curry powders, I'm with you.  A little goes a long way and, for me, I can take it only a few times a year.

Asian curry pastes are a whole different ballgame.  There are yellow, red and green curry pastes.  You will find them in the Asian section of your market.  If not, try an Asian market.  What, no Asian markets in your town?  Try the internet.  You can get anything, and I mean anything, on the net.

Asian curry pastes are aromatic and spicy.  When balanced with the sweetness and body of coconut milk, the pastes mellow out and don't overpower the fish.  Coconut milk is in the Asian section of your market also.  Don't get the really sweet stuff used for making piÒa coladas.

If you like your food hot and spicy, use a little more of the paste.  Add a little at a time and give the paste some time to warm up before adding more.  This recipe is great with just about any fish.  I prepare it most often with albacore, dorado and yellowtail.  It's great with steamed rice and sautÈed vegetables.

               Fish, Tomato, Avocado And Basil Beurre Blanc

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     skinless fish fillets, abt 1/2" thk - -- (3 to 4 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  Lawry's Lemon Pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2              large  just-ripe avocados -- peeled, seeded,
                        and sliced about 1/4" thick
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  2              large  tomatoes -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        = (see comments about tomatoes below)
                        === BASIL BUERRE BLANC ===
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  shallot -- minced
                        = (or the white part of a green onion)
  1                     lemon -- juice only
     1/2         pound  butter
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

To make the sauce, bring the wine, shallot and lemon juice to a boil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat.  Reduce liquid to 1/4 cup.  Strain out shallots.

Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter and basil until butter is melted and sauce is smooth.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.  Do not bring to a boil again.

If you need to rewarm to sauce, do so over very low heat while gently whisking until warm, not hot.  If it gets too hot, it will separate and look bad.

Season the fish on both sides with Lawry's Lemon Pepper.  Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Lightly brown fish on both sides and then add the white wine to pan.  Cook for a few minutes more.

When you slice the avocado, sprinkle the lemon juice over so that the slices will not brown.

To serve, place a piece of fish on the plate, top with sliced avocado and then tomato.  Repeat layer.  Drizzle sauce over fish, avocado and tomato.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you don't have any fresh basil handy, use any other fresh herb you like or leave out the herb part altogether.  The type of fish you use is not critical.  The recipe works with just about any fresh fish.

Obviously, this recipe is better when the tomatoes are homegrown, not the ones in the stores.  If your tomatoes are store-bought, slice them and then sprinkle a little bit of salt, a pinch of sugar and a splash of balsamic or white wine vinegar on them and let them sit for 15 minutes before assembling the dish.  You'll be amazed at how much better they taste.

I've allowed half an avocado per person.  I like avocado.  If you don't like avocado, you should pick a different recipe anyway.

                  Fried Quail With Chipotle Cream Sauce

Categories    : Main Dish                       Quail
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     quail -- split in half
  2               cups  buttermilk
  10                    garlic cloves -- minced
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        = (sea salt or kosher salt preferred)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Peanut oil -- for deep-frying
     2/3           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  minced chipotle chilies in adobo sauce

Combine quail, buttermilk and garlic in a bowl.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Combine flour with next 5 ingredients.  Blend sour cream, heavy cream and chipotles.  Let stand for 15 minutes at room temperature before serving.

Remove quail from buttermilk.  Dredge in seasoned flour and fry in oil heated to 360 to 375 degrees for about 5 to 6 minutes or until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve with sauce on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In many parts of the country, just about any sauce is referred to as "gravy".  It doesn't matter that the gravy is actually a reduction of port wine, fresh berries and shallot, finished silky-smooth with a touch of butterÖit's still gravy.

This simple, um, gravy takes on some smoky-hot Southwestern flavors from chipotle peppers.  Use the chipotles sparingly.  You can always add more if it's not quite hot enough.  You'll find them in a small can (packed in adobo sauce -- also spicy) in the Hispanic section of your market.

I like to serve this dish with well-seasoned rice and fresh corn.  By the way, quail really must be eaten with your hands.  I don't care what Martha Stewart says.

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     lemons -- juice only
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1              pinch  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1 1/2           cups  sliced squid -- (see info below)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

In a large skillet over medium heat, lightly brown bacon.  Add onion, bell pepper and asparagus and cook until asparagus is just barely cooked, but still crisp.

Add garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard and sugar.  Stir to blend and heat for 2 minutes.

Add basil and squid.  Cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper and top with cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Attack of the Giant Squid!  You've probably eaten giant squid before, but just didn't know it.  Ever had calamari steaks or strips?  Breaded and fried, it could be anything.  You take a hunk of giant squid and pound it into oblivion, dunk it, bread it and fry it.  It tastes good, but the above recipe tastes even better.  Special thanks to Captain Ron Baker of Fish Talk Radio for my first big honkin' squid.

To process the squid, take the cleaned tube and lay it membrane-side down on a cutting surface.  With a very sharp fillet knife, slice the squid as thinly as you can, cutting at an angle and pushing the knife up along the membrane.  When you're done, you should have the membrane on the surface and the squid sliced into very thin pieces, about 1 inch wide.  Cook the squid until it just barely changes color.  If you cook it too long, you'll be very disappointed.

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Waterfowl
                Wild Geese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless goose breast half fillets
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  ground sage
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  salt
  4               cups  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  blackberry preserves
  8                     thin slices prosciutto
  1              bunch  fresh basil
  1                cup  grated peppered jack cheese
     1/4           cup  seasoned breadcrumbs

Place goose breasts on a firm, flat surface.  With a sharp knife, slice each breast half along the thinnest edge, stopping the cut 1/2 inch before the outer edge.  This will "butterfly" the breasts and you can open them like a book.  Rub on all sides with the garlic and season with the dry seasonings.  Place on a plate, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Combine wine, vinegar and sugar in a sauce pan, bring to a boil and reduce liquid to 1 cup.  Add preserves, bring to a boil, simmer on low heat for 5 minutes more.  For each breast, open and place on a flat surface.  Lay one slice of prosciutto across each breast.  Top with 3 to 4 basil leaves.  Combine cheese and breadcrumbs and press over basil.  Fold edges in over mixture and roll breasts like a burrito.

Place in an 8- by 8-inch pan, seam-side down.  Place rolled breasts side by side and bake at 425 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes or until meat is rare to medium-rare (about 125 degrees internal temperature).  Allow breasts to cool for five minutes, and then slice each into three medallions.  Arrange medallions on plates and spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced into thin wedges
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     2/3           cup  dried cherries
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter -- chilled
  2                     skinless goose breast half fillets - -- (to 4)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Place the apples into a medium saucepan with 3/4 cup water, brown sugar and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer until apples are just tender, about 10 minutes.  Add cherries and simmer another 5 minutes.

Drain liquid and stir in cinnamon, coriander, cayenne pepper and butter.  Keep warm, but just warm.  If sauce becomes too cool and congeals, heat over very low heat while stirring until warm, but not hot.

Slice goose breasts widthwise in half so that the thickness is roughly one-half of pre-sliced thickness.  Season goose breasts with salt and pepper.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown breasts evenly on both sides until medium-rare.  Spoon apple and cherry mixture onto each plate and top with duck breasts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you can't find dried cherries in your market, substitute any dried berries (most stores carry "Craisins" -- a sweetened cranberry) or even raisins.  This preparation also works wonderfully with pork, upland game or antlered game.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roasted green chilies - (4 oz)
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
  1              pinch  dried oregano
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine all ingredients except oil in a blender or food processor.  Process until smooth.  While motor is running, add oil in a thin stream until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper.

Serve some extra on the side or save for another time.  Also makes a tasty marinade for fish, poultry, pork or upland game.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  How you cook the fish or the type of fish you use is up to you.  This spirited vinaigrette is great on just about anything.  I like it with grilled fish and warm flour tortillas.  Either warm the vinaigrette slightly or serve at room temperature.  When the fish is cooked, spoon some of the vinaigrette over, but don't drown it.

  2             medium  nectarines -- flesh chopped
                        into 1/2" cubes
  1                cup  cherries -- seeded, halved
     1/2                jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  2                     green onions, white part and
                        abt half of the green -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice

Season fish liberally with salt and pepper.  Place on a medium-heat grill until just cooked.  Flip fish over half way through cooking if you are confident that it will remain intact.

To prepare salsa, combine all ingredients and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.  To serve, place fish on plate and spoon salsa over middle half.  Do not smother fish with salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I just found some incredibly sweet white nectarines and perfectly ripe Bing cherries at one of the Sacramento, California farmer's markets.  The nectarines were sweet as candy!  I used a fair amount of fresh lemon and lime juices to balance the natural sweetness of the fruit.  You may want to use add a little at a time until you've got the flavor where you want it.

If your halibut has a habit of sticking to the grill, it's a good idea to leave the skin on while cooking and then remove the skin before serving.  For best grilling results, spray some pan spray on the grates before lighting, set skin-side down on grates and don't flip it unless you're sure it will work.  Close the lid on the 'cue and the fish will cook throughout.

                Trout

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     trout - (16 oz ea)
                        = (weight after cleaning)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  2          teaspoons  honey
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  minced red onion
  1         tablespoon  Italian seasoning

Season trout evenly with salt and pepper.  Place trout in a plastic, ceramic or glass container and pour marinade over.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours, turning occasionally.

Place marinated trout over medium-hot coals.  Cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side or until skin is crispy and trout is just cooked.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The sweet flavors of freshly squeezed orange juice and honey are balanced with just enough vinegar so that the marinade doesn't overpower the fish.  Trout has a delicate flavor so you don't want to bury it in strong flavors.  The marinade is great chicken, pork and shellfish as well.

             Grilled Venison Steak With Balsamic Morel Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     deer steaks, abt 1" thk - (6 to 8 oz ea), 
                        fat and gristle
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BALSAMIC MOREL SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  minced green onion -- white part only
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  beef broth
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  1                cup  fresh morel mushrooms -- quickly rinsed,
                        and dried
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/2      teaspoon  cold water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To season meat, combine olive oil and garlic and rub mixture over steaks.  Season steaks with salt and pepper.  Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.  Grill over a medium-hot barbecue grill until rare to medium-rare.  Allow meat to rest for a few minutes before serving.

To prepare sauce, heat oil over medium heat in a medium saucepan.  Add onion and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add pepper, balsamic vinegar, wine, broth and rosemary.  Bring to a boil and then simmer until liquid is reduced by one-half.

Stir in mushrooms and mustard.  Cook for 5 to 6 minutes.  Stir in cornstarch mixture and stir until sauce is thickened.  If sauce gets too thick, add a little more wine or broth.  If it's too thin, add a little more of the cornstarch and cold water mixture.

To serve, arrange steaks on plates and spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe goes out to all of the faithful listeners of Adventure Sports Outdoors radio in Peoria, Illinois.  Hosted by the legendary Harry Canterbury and the Rednose Gang, this show is the information source for central Illinois hunters and fishermen.  ASO also has a magazine and a television program.  Check them out at http://www.asomagazine.com/.

Harry told me that he's been busy gathering fresh morel mushrooms in undisclosed areas surrounding Peoria.  Here's one idea for how to make good use of them.  Another idea would be to send them to all to me and let me deal with them.  I'm guessing that's not going to happen.

                   Grilled Venison With Beerbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  venison steaks, loins, etc. - (to 2 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  Lawry's Seasoned Pepper
  1         tablespoon  Lawry's Seasoned Salt
  3                     fresh garlic cloves -- minced
                        === BEERBECUE SAUCE ===
                        = (makes approximately 2 cups)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  yellow onion -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  beer - (12 oz) -- see * Note
                        = (dark beer preferred)
  1                     lemon -- sliced into rings
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  tomato purÈe
     1/2      teaspoon  liquid smoke
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Pour beer into a large cup and then back and forth into another cup until beer flattens and foam is gone.

Season meat with next three ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate for one hour.  Grill over hot coals to rare or medium-rare temperature.

Just before meat is removed from the grill, baste with a little sauce.  Serve sauce on the side or drizzled over a portion of the meat.  Allow meat to rest a few minutes before slicing.

Prepare sauce.  Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and cook until translucent.  Add brown sugar and garlic and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper.  Stir well, bring to a boil and then simmer until sauce thickens.  The sauce should be the consistency of thick tomato sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I know, the name "Beerbecue Sauce" is stupid, but, I do stupid things.  Once you get past the cutesy name, I think you will enjoy the recipe.  I've also used the barbecue sauce on grilled fish, upland game and just about any thing else that works on the 'cue.  I often grill any cut of deer from the loin to the hams.

The "secret" is to remove anything that's not muscle.  Remove the muscles from the hindquarter roast; making sure that there is not silver skin, bone, etc.  Your body doesn't digest silver skin; it smells bad and tastes bad -- a couple of good reasons to remove it before cooking.

If you are using the muscles from the hindquarter, slice them into 2- to 3-inch thick pieces along the grain of the meat.  That means that the lines in the meat will be running from end to end.  After grilling to no more than medium-rare, slice the meat across the grain to serve.  You'll find that it eats much more tender than if you were to ignore this whole grain thing and just toss the meat on the grill.

Season meat with next three ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate for one hour.  Grill over hot coals to rare or medium-rare temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Just before meat is removed from the grill, baste with a little sauce.  Serve sauce on the side or drizzled over a portion of the meat.  Allow meat to rest a few minutes before slicing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare sauce.  Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and cook until translucent.  Add brown sugar and garlic and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper.  Stir well, bring to a boil and then simmer until sauce thickens.  The sauce should be the consistency of thick tomato sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I know, the name &quot;Beerbecue Sauce&quot; is stupid, but, I do stupid things.  Once you get past the cutesy name, I think you will enjoy the recipe.  I&apos;ve also used the barbecue sauce on grilled fish, upland game and just about any thing else that works on the &apos;cue.  I often grill any cut of deer from the loin to the hams.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The &quot;secret&quot; is to remove anything that&apos;s not muscle.  Remove the muscles from the hindquarter roast; making sure that there is not silver skin, bone, etc.  Your body doesn&apos;t digest silver skin; it smells bad and tastes bad -- a couple of good reasons to remove it before cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you are using the muscles from the hindquarter, slice them into 2- to 3-inch thick pieces along the grain of the meat.  That means that the lines in the meat will be running from end to end.  After grilling to no more than medium-rare, slice the meat across the grain to serve.  You&apos;ll find that it eats much more tender than if you were to ignore this whole grain thing and just toss the meat on the grill.

                      Herb Roasted Pheasant Breasts

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pheasant
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pheasant breast halves - (to 6) -- skin and bones
                        intact
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  chopped assorted fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, sage, rosemary,
                        oregano, tarragon, parsley, etc)
     1/2           cup  cooked diced smoky bacon
  1                     lemon -- finely diced
                        = (the whole lemon)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

Using your fingers, start at the neck and carefully separate the skin from the breast.  Combine garlic and remaining ingredients and spread a thin layer of the mixture between the skin and the breast of each bird.

Place remaining herb stuff on the top of the breasts.  If your breasts do not have any skin, just put all of the herb mixture on the top of the breasts.

Place on a lightly-greased baking dish and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until breasts are just-cooked.  Time and temperature will vary according to oven and size of pheasant.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Perfectly cooked pheasant breasts are just the slightest bit pink in the center when removed from the heat.  Because they are so lean, they continue to cook even after you take them out of the pan, oven or off of the grill.  If you cook your legs the same way, they will be tough and chewy.  But do save the legs since they are great for making stocks.

For God's sake, do not put your pheasants in a crockpot with a can of condensed creamed soup.  Yes, I know it tastes good, just like creamed soup.  You say your pheasant is dry unless you cook it in the crockpot?  Well, stop cooking it so long.  If you don't have any skin on your bird, this recipe will still work.

                      Hot And Crusty Largemouth Bass

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Bass                            Fish (Fresh Water)
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  bass fillets -- cut into chunks
     3/4           cup  milk
  2                     eggs
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced red onion
     2/3           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Canola or peanut oil -- for frying

Lightly whisk together milk, eggs and several dashes of Tabasco.  It's your funeral, so use as much of the hot stuff as you think you can handle.  In a wide bowl, combine remaining ingredients except oil.  Heat oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.

Dip fish in milk mixture and then cornmeal mixture.  Drop carefully into hot oil with tongs, one piece at a time.  Remove and place on paper towels to drain when fish is golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The fiery flavor and crunchy texture of this simple fish dish makes it one of my favorites.  You can serve this either as an appetizer or as a main dish.  Serve with your favorite dipping sauce such as tartar, cocktail or honey-mustard.  Try not to put too much spice into your accompanying sauce since the fish is plenty hot by itself.

This recipe works equally well with any fish with a moderate to low oil content.  When frying fish, make certain that your fish and batter are both very cold before beginning the process.  Cold batters and seasonings adhere to cold fish more readily than to warm or room temperature fish.

                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  60                    doves breast halves -- skin on or off
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
                        = (or substitute 1/3 cup white wine
                        vinegar plus 1 tbspn sugar)
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  15                    jalapeÒo peppers -- seeded, and
                        cut into 4 strips each
  30                    strips bacon -- partially cooked
  20                    wooden skewers -- soaked in water
                        for 30 minutes

Combine sugar with next 7 ingredients in a bowl and mix well.  Add dove breasts and marinate for 1 hour.

For each skewer, place a strip of bacon on a flat surface.  Lay a strip of jalapeÒo , then dove breast, then another jalapeÒo strip and dove breast.  Wrap with bacon place 3 bacon-wrapped breast "bundles" side by side.

Place 2 skewers through each set of three bundles, putting the skewers about 3/4-inch apart from one another.  Grill over medium-hot coals until medium-rare.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Fire up the barbecue and grill up some fresh dove breasts with a Southwestern flair.  Not a bad way to spend the afternoon or evening with a few hunting buddies after a successful dove shoot.  Get all of the ingredients ready the day before the shoot so you can get right down to the business of cooking after the hunt.  Don't forget the ice cold beer to take the edge off the jalapeÒos!

                         Margarita Smoked Salmon

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     salmon fillet -- skin intact
                        = (bigger is better)
  2               cups  sweet and sour mix
  1                cup  tequila
  1                cup  triple sec
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
                        Juice of 6 limes
                        Juice of 6 lemons

Combine sweet and sour mix with remaining ingredients.  Place fillet in a glass, ceramic or plastic container and pour marinade over.  Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 5 hours, turning occasionally.

Remove from marinade and place on a rack to air-dry for 30 minutes before smoking.

Preheat a smoker and place the fish on the center of the rack.  Smoke at medium-low (150 to 175 degrees) until the fish is firm and glazed on the outside.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  If you enjoy the flavor and texture of smoked fish, but are not quite sure how to go about making it, this is a great way to start.  The smoked fish is incredibly moist and delicious and you and your friends may have a little fun during the smoking process, that is, if you like margaritas.  If you like your salmon more dry than moist, lower the heat to about 150 degrees and add an hour or two of smoking time.

If you don't own a smoker, you can make one out of an ordinary barbecue kettle.  To do so, fire up about 20 briquettes in the 'cue, let them get white hot, and then move them towards the outside of the kettle.  Put some real fruit, hickory or mesquite chunks on the coals and let them get started.  Open the vents at the bottom and top about 1/4 inch, place the marinated salmon on the center of the grill and cover the grill with the lid.  When the smoke dies down, add a few more wood chunks.  Fish smoked in this manner is not cured so it needs to be either refrigerated or frozen.

Preheat a smoker and place the fish on the center of the rack.  Smoke at medium-low (150 to 175 degrees) until the fish is firm and glazed on the outside.

Comments:  If you enjoy the flavor and texture of smoked fish, but are not quite sure how to go about making it, this is a great way to start.  The smoked fish is incredibly moist and delicious and you and your friends may have a little fun during the smoking process, that is, if you like margaritas.  If you like your salmon more dry than moist, lower the heat to about 150 degrees and add an hour or two of smoking time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you don&apos;t own a smoker, you can make one out of an ordinary barbecue kettle.  To do so, fire up about 20 briquettes in the &apos;cue, let them get white hot, and then move them towards the outside of the kettle.  Put some real fruit, hickory or mesquite chunks on the coals and let them get started.  Open the vents at the bottom and top about 1/4 inch, place the marinated salmon on the center of the grill and cover the grill with the lid.  When the smoke dies down, add a few more wood chunks.  Fish smoked in this manner is not cured so it needs to be either refrigerated or frozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pheasants -- quartered
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chicken broth
  2                     lemons -- juice only
     1/2           cup  sliced onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  Italian seasoning
                        === PECAN PESTO VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/2           cup  pecan pieces -- roasted in
                        a 325 degree oven until slightly browned
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves
  1                     lemon -- juice only
     1/4           cup  Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine marinade ingredients.  Place pheasant pieces in a ceramic, plastic or glass dish and pour marinade over.  Cover and refrigerate, turning occasionally.  Marinate for 6 to 12 hours.

To cook, remove leg/thigh sections and place in a well-oiled baking dish.  Pour marinade over.  Cover with foil and bake in a 375 degree oven for 1 hour.

Add breast pieces, cover and bake for 20 minutes more or until pheasant breast pieces are just cooked.

To serve, arrange pheasant pieces on plates and drizzle vinaigrette over.

Pecan Pesto Vinaigrette:  In a food processor or blender, process pecan pieces, garlic, basil, lemon and a few tablespoons of the olive oil until it forms a paste.  Add parmesan cheese and vinegar.  Pulse to blend.  While motor is running, add remaining oil in a thin stream until emulsified.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Let's say you found a pheasant in the back of your freezer and it's a year old or more.  The thing about meat is, it just doesn't get better with prolonged freezing.  This is true with beef, more so with poultry and fishÖforget about it.  When it comes to fish, fresh is always best.  But this recipe is about pheasant.  If your bird has been frozen for awhile, it just might need a little help.  Freezing tends to dry out meats, especially if you have not caught on to the vacuum-packaging thing.  If you don't have a vacuum-packaging machine, go get one now.

One of the best ways to help out a tired old frozen bird is with a good marinade.  Marinades will add flavor to meats that are long past fresh.  Don't use marinades to cover up foods that either look bad or smell bad.  There's a reason they got that way and they should be disposed of.  I like to serve this with rice.

Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Wild Boar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boar or feral pig chops - (to 3) -- bone in or out
                        = (looks better with the bone!)
  1         tablespoon  Lawry's Seasoned Pepper
  2          teaspoons  Lawry's Seasoned Salt
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  8              whole  garlic cloves - (to 10)
  6              whole  peeled shallots - (to 8)
  1                cup  baby carrots
  2                     celery stalks -- cut 2" pieces
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  chilled butter -- cut into 4 pieces

Season meat with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and Lawry's Seasoned Pepper.  Toss seasoned chops with 1/4 cup of the olive oil, rosemary and lemon juice.  Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours.

Heat remaining oil in a large ovenproof skillet.  Add chops and lightly brown on both sides.  Remove chops and set aside.

Add garlic, shallots, carrots and celery and cook until lightly browned.  Return chops to the pan and place the pan in a preheated 375 degree oven.  Cook for 5 to 8 minutes more or until chops are just done and shallots are slightly soft.  Remove pan from oven.  Remove chops from pan and keep warm.

Place pan over a medium-high burner and add wine.  Reduce wine to about 2 tablespoons.  Remove from heat and whisk in chilled butter until melted.

To serve, place vegetables on plates and arrange chops over.  Drizzle sauce over chops.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  It's much more likely that the animal you shoot is a feral hog, not a wild boar.  There are populations of wild boar in the U.S., mostly in the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, but the rest of us are probably gunning for a closer cousin of the domestic hog.

There is a relatively small danger that your hog, boar, etc. may carry the parasite trichinella, which causes trichinosis... a bad thing.  Make sure that the meat is cooked to an internal temperature of 155 degrees for several minutes, just to be safe.  It's also best to trim most of the fat from the chops as it often imparts unpleasant flavors to the cooked meat.

If you don't have boar chops handy, substitute lamb, venison or pork chops.  Use any vegetables in season to accompany the chops if you don't want to use shallot, celery and carrot.

     2/3           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs -- your choice
  1              bunch  Italian parsley

Rub venison with mustard.  Combine salt and peppercorns and evenly coat venison.  Grill or broil until just barely browned on the outside, but still rare on the inside.  Allow to cool.

Slice bread into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Combine oil and garlic and brush over sliced bread.  Toast in a 350 degree oven until lightly browned.  Cool.

Slice cooled venison as thinly as possible.  Combine mayonnaise and herbs.  Place a dollop of mayonnaise on each toast.  Top with sliced venison and garnish with a parsley sprig.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Most of us are short on venison loins and tenderloins and long on ground stuff, shoulder and neck roasts, etc.  Here's a way to stretch the good stuff, assuming that you want to share with others.  It is best served very rare.  If any of your guests have a problem with eating deer that is just seared on the outside, give them a bag of potato chips.

                          Pheasant And Leek Soup

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pheasant                        Soups/Stews
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              whole  pheasants -- liberally seasoned
                        with garlic salt and pepper
  1                     yellow onion -- quartered
  3                     celery ribs -- each cut in two
  8              whole  garlic cloves - (to 12)
  1                cup  diced smoked bacon
  1             gallon  water
  3                     bay leaves
  4                     chicken bouillon cubes
  2                     leeks, white part only -- thoroughly washed,
                        and thinly sliced into rings
  3                     carrots -- diced
  2              large  red potatoes -- skin intact,
                        and diced into 1/2" cubes
  3             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  2               cups  diced fresh or canned tomatoes

Place pheasants, onions, celery and garlic in a large roasting pan.  Top with diced bacon.  Place in a 375 degree oven and roast for 1 hour or until pheasants are evenly browned.  Remove from oven, allow to cool and pull meat from pheasant breasts.  Save breast meat.

Cut carcasses into 4 smaller pieces and place in a large stockpot with roasted vegetables.  Cover with water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer for 3 hours, stirring contents occasionally and keeping water level high enough to just cover contents.  Remove pheasant pieces with tongs and pour remaining liquid through a colander to remove solids.

Return liquid to pot and add bouillon, leeks, carrots, potatoes and rosemary.  Add water, if necessary, so that there is about 1 1/2 quarts liquid.  Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer until carrots just begin to soften.  Add pulled pheasant breast pieces and tomatoes.  Simmer for 5 minutes more, remove rosemary and serve with warm sourdough bread.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Too many hunters discard valuable ingredients when not using, for instance, the carcass of a pheasant to make a delicious stock or sauce.  I like to roast my pheasant scraps in much the same way as is called for in this recipe.  The only difference is that I simmer the bones until the broth is thick and concentrated.  The liquid is then strained into ice cube trays and frozen.  Once frozen, I break the cubes into a zipper lock bag and use a few at a time to add flavor to sauces, sautÈs and stir-fry's.  The stock for this soup may be made a day or two ahead or simmered at very low heat overnight.

                      Pheasant Breasts And Asparagus

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pheasant
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     pheasant breast halves -- boned, skinned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chopped fresh mushrooms -- lightly sautÈed in
                        butter until softened, then allow to cool
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh rosemary leaves
  1                cup  grated cheese
                        = (cheddar, jack, feta, Parmesan or a
                        combination)
     1/4           cup  seasoned breadcrumbs
  8              large  asparagus spears -- trimmed, blanched,
                        and cooled
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

Lay each pheasant breast half on a flat surface and "butterfly" by slicing a sharp knife along an edge and opening up the breasts so that there is a "hinge" holding the two sides together, much like a book.  Season liberally inside and out with salt and pepper.

Combine mushrooms, rosemary, cheese and breadcrumbs.  Lay an asparagus spear in each breast along the hinge.  The bottom of the spear should lie in the breast about 1 inch from the outside edge.  Place an equal portion of the mushroom mixture on each asparagus.  Fold the bottom edge over the asparagus and filling and then roll from one side, much like a burrito.  The top of the asparagus will be sticking out of one end of the pheasant breast.

Lay each breast, seam-side down, in a baking dish.  Pour wine into pan and cover with lid or foil.  Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until breasts are just cooked.  Serve over rice or pasta.  NOTE: You may want to pour the liquid from the baking dish into a saucepan and thicken with roux or a cornstarch slurry to thicken.  The sauce can then be drizzled over the cooked pheasant breasts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  It seems that you can get fresh asparagus of fairly good quality just about any time of the year.  You just have to be willing to pay for it.  In September, those of us in California can find some great "grass" from South America if we feel like ponying up three to four dollars a pound.  I prefer to wait until March or April when the local product is of exceptional quality and can be found for about a buck a pound.  Stop by my house for dinner during the spring and you're likely to eat something with asparagus and, hopefully, you've brought a good bottle of wine.  The recipe calls for two pheasant breast halves per person because my male friends are goons.  If yours are not, you may get by with a few less breasts.

                 Pheasant With Champagne-Grapefruit Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pheasant
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     pheasant breast halves -- preferably de-boned,
                        and with skin intact
                        Lawry's Seasoned Salt -- to taste
                        Lawry's Seasoned Pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  dry sparkling wine
                        === SAUCE ===
  1             bottle  dry sparkling wine
                        = (reserve 1/4 cup for above)
  2        tablespoons  shallots -- minced
                        = (or white part of green onion)
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  1              large  grapefruit -- segmented, and
                        membranes removed
  4        tablespoons  chilled butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare sauce.  In a medium saucepan, add first three sauce ingredients and reduce liquid to 1/2 cup over medium-high heat.  Remove shallots.  Add grapefruit segments and cook for 5 minutes.  Allow mixture to cool, then transfer to a food processor or blender and process until smooth.  Return to saucepan and heat sauce to warm.  Just before serving, whisk in cold butter, a little at a time, until melted.

To prepare pheasant breasts, first season with salt and pepper.  Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Brown pheasant lightly on both sides.  Add garlic and sparkling wine and sautÈ until breasts are just-cooked.  Overcooking will make your pheasant eat like cardboard.

To serve, spoon some sauce onto plate and arrange cooked breasts on sauce.  Spoon additional sauce over breasts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  To the less adventurous, a recipe with "Champagne-Grapefruit Sauce" might seem a bit too, wellÖCalifornian.  I have enough trouble trying to convince people in the southern U.S. states that we have ducks in California, lots of them.  Some people think that we surf to work, stopping by a movie star's home for a quick espresso.  Well, we're a little short on ocean and Hollywood types in northern central California, but we do have champagne, excuse me, "sparkling wine", and grapefruit.  I'm sure you've heard of a Mimosa, the champagne and orange juice concoction.  They taste pretty good, yes?

I like to leave the wing bone intact when preparing boneless pheasant breasts.  I just think it looks better.  The sauce can be made ahead of time, except for the butter part and then finished (the butter part) just before serving.  I usually garnish the finished dish with additional grapefruit segments or grapefruit zest.

Prepare sauce.  In a medium saucepan, add first three sauce ingredients and reduce liquid to 1/2 cup over medium-high heat.  Remove shallots.  Add grapefruit segments and cook for 5 minutes.  Allow mixture to cool, then transfer to a food processor or blender and process until smooth.  Return to saucepan and heat sauce to warm.  Just before serving, whisk in cold butter, a little at a time, until melted.

To prepare pheasant breasts, first season with salt and pepper.  Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Brown pheasant lightly on both sides.  Add garlic and sparkling wine and sautÈ until breasts are just-cooked.  Overcooking will make your pheasant eat like cardboard.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, spoon some sauce onto plate and arrange cooked breasts on sauce.  Spoon additional sauce over breasts.

Comments:  To the less adventurous, a recipe with &quot;Champagne-Grapefruit Sauce&quot; might seem a bit too, wellÖCalifornian.  I have enough trouble trying to convince people in the southern U.S. states that we have ducks in California, lots of them.  Some people think that we surf to work, stopping by a movie star&apos;s home for a quick espresso.  Well, we&apos;re a little short on ocean and Hollywood types in northern central California, but we do have champagne, excuse me, &quot;sparkling wine&quot;, and grapefruit.  I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard of a Mimosa, the champagne and orange juice concoction.  They taste pretty good, yes?
</DirT>
<DirT>
I like to leave the wing bone intact when preparing boneless pheasant breasts.  I just think it looks better.  The sauce can be made ahead of time, except for the butter part and then finished (the butter part) just before serving.  I usually garnish the finished dish with additional grapefruit segments or grapefruit zest.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     Canadian or speckled goose breast halves - -- (to 4), skinned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh ginger
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  thinly-sliced carrots
  1                cup  sliced celery
  1                cup  sliced red onion
     1/2           cup  pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  honey

Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add ginger and garlic to hot oil and cook for 30 seconds.  Add goose and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add vegetables and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add remaining ingredients except pineapple chunks and almonds and bring to boil.

Stir in pineapple and almonds.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

               Poached Fish With Artichoke And Basil Sauce

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fish fillets
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1             medium  yellow onion -- roughly chopped
     2/3           cup  marinated artichoke hearts
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  slivered or sliced almonds -- lightly toasted
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large skillet, combine salt, wine, onion and 1 cup of water.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes.  Place fish in water and add enough hot water to just barely cover.  Reduce heat to a medium-low simmer.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until fish is just cooked.

To make sauce, combine artichoke hearts and the next 5 ingredients in a blender or food processor.  Process until mixture is almost pureed, but still a tad chunky.  While motor is running, add oil in a thin stream until emulsified.  Add to a saucepan and heat over a low heat until warm.  Do not allow to boil!  Season with salt and pepper.

Place an equal portion of the cooked fish on each plate and drizzle sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The great thing about this dish is that it can be served either hot or cold.  If you choose to serve it cold, set the poached fish on a bed of mixed lettuce, garnish with tomato, cucumber, etc. and add a little rice vinegar to the sauce and call it Artichoke Pesto Vinaigrette.

             Poached Salmon Salad With Lime-Tarragon Dressing

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  skin-on salmon fillet
  1                cup  white wine
  1                cup  fish or chicken broth
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     handfuls mixed greens
  1              large  ripe tomato -- sliced
  1                     avocado -- diced
  1                     cucumber -- sliced
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried tarragon)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, bring wine and next 4 ingredients to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer and place salmon in liquid.  Cover with lid or foil and poach until done, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove salmon from pan and allow to cool.

Remove skin from salmon.  Arrange salad ingredients on plates.  Top with poached salmon and dressing.

Dressing:  Combine all ingredients in a jar with lid and shake to mix.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Poaching is a great way to keep fish moist and flavorful.  You may be surprised at how fast the fish cooks.  When the salmon turns pink on the outside, wait about 3 to 5 minutes longer and it should be cooked on the inside as well.  Poaching times will vary according to the thickness of the fillets.

Leaving the skin on during poaching will help keep the fillet intact.  To remove the cooked fillet from the pan, carefully place a pair of spatulas under the fish and lift out gently and evenly.  Pat gently with paper towels.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, bring wine and next 4 ingredients to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer and place salmon in liquid.  Cover with lid or foil and poach until done, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove salmon from pan and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove skin from salmon.  Arrange salad ingredients on plates.  Top with poached salmon and dressing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dressing:  Combine all ingredients in a jar with lid and shake to mix.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Poaching is a great way to keep fish moist and flavorful.  You may be surprised at how fast the fish cooks.  When the salmon turns pink on the outside, wait about 3 to 5 minutes longer and it should be cooked on the inside as well.  Poaching times will vary according to the thickness of the fillets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Leaving the skin on during poaching will help keep the fillet intact.  To remove the cooked fillet from the pan, carefully place a pair of spatulas under the fish and lift out gently and evenly.  Pat gently with paper towels.

                Poached Salmon With Champagne Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     salmon fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- each cut into the
                        shape of a heart
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  dry champagne
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  1                     shallot -- minced
                        = (or white part of 2 green onions)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  chilled butter

In a large skillet over medium heat, combine champagne, water, lemon juice and shallot.  Bring to a boil and then simmer for 5 minutes.

With a spatula, carefully place salmon fillets into skillet.  If necessary, add enough additional champagne so that liquid just rises to the top edge of the fish, but does not cover it.  Cover with a lid or foil and simmer for 10 minutes or until fish is firm, but not overcooked.

Carefully pour 1/2 cup of liquid from skillet into a saucepan and add cream.  Bring to a boil and reduce liquid to about 1/3 cup.  Whisk in chilled butter until melted.

To serve, place salmon on vegetables, rice or pasta and spoon sauce around fish.  Go put on your smoking jacket, put on some jazz and turn the lights down low.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Don't take my word for it; ask a bunch of women if they think that having a man prepare a wonderful meal for the two of them is romantic.  It could even be a mediocre, if not bad, meal but the effort was there and that means something.  Women like stuff that means something.

For most men, the list of things we really care about is a pretty short one.  If our wives or girlfriends present us with a gorgeous candlelit meal, we're usually thinking past dessert.  So this recipe is for the men.  What I mean is, the meal is prepared by the man, served with candlelight, champagne, etc.  The woman is genuinely surprised by your effort and, if all goes well, you are rewarded in other ways less food-related, or maybe food is involvedÖthat's your business.  You get the idea.  Now go take a bath.

                Seafood                         Striped Bass


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     striped bass fillets - (6 to 8 oz)
  1                cup  salt-and-pepper seasoned flour
  2               cups  grated skin-on red potato
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2                     green onions -- minced
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  3        tablespoons  chilled butter

Dust fish with seasoned flour.  Add some salt and pepper and the egg to the shredded potatoes and mix well.  Press a 1/2-inch layer of potatoes onto the top of each fillet.

Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Carefully place the fillets, potato-side down, into the hot oil.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until medium-brown.

Carefully flip fillets over and add remaining ingredients except butter to pan.  Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes or until fish is just cooked.

Transfer fish to plates and increase heat in pan to high.  Reduce liquid in pan to a few tablespoons, remove pan from heat and whisk in chilled butter until melted.

To serve, drizzle sauce over fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Take a little extra time to clean up your striper fillets.  Remove the skin and any of the dark, fatty areas along the center of the fillet.  Make 'em pretty and they'll taste better once cooked.

                         Rabbit With White Beans

Categories    : Main Dish                       Rabbit / Hare
                Small Game

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  white beans -- soaked overnight
  2               cups  carrots -- diced
  1              large  onion -- diced
  4                     celery ribs -- diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Chicken broth -- as needed
  2                     young rabbits -- cut into pieces
  1              pound  bacon
  1                cup  tomato puree
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place white beans, carrot, onion, celery and garlic in a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven.  Add chicken broth to one inch over beans and vegetables.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about one hour or until beans are softened, but not cooked completely.

Cook the bacon in a large skillet until done.  Remove bacon, leaving grease in the pan, and break into bite-sized pieces.

Fry rabbit pieces in bacon until browned.  Add browned rabbit, bacon and tomato puree to pot.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees.  Check occasionally to make sure that liquid has not cooked out.  Add additional chicken broth to cover rabbit, if needed.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a simplified version of the classic French dish, cassoulet.  Remember to wear rubber gloves and wash your hands thoroughly after handling rabbits to avoid exposure to tularemia, a disease carried by most wild rabbits.  You can speed this dish up by substituting canned cooked white beans for the dried ones, but the texture and flavor of the finished dish won't be quite the same.

            Roasted Quail With Southwestern Cornbread Stuffing

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pheasant
                Quail                           Upland Birds


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             whole  quail -- rinsed, and
                        patted dry with paper towels
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground chili powder
  2               cups  dry cornbread stuffing
  1                cup  warm chicken broth
     1/2           cup  diced Anaheim pepper
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
     1/2           cup  roasted and salted pumpkin seeds
     1/3      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  apricot preserves
  12                    strips bacon

Season quail lightly with next 3 ingredients.  Combine stuffing and next 5 ingredients and lightly stuff into cavity of each quail.  Spread preserves over quail and then wrap each with 1 bacon strip.

Roast in a 400 degree oven for 12 minutes or until bacon is just brown.  Serve with bacon intact.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Be careful not to overstuff the quail or they may take too long to cook.  You may want to double the stuffing ingredients and serve some extra on the side.  Look for pumpkin seeds in the bulk bin of your supermarket.

Season quail lightly with next 3 ingredients.  Combine stuffing and next 5 ingredients and lightly stuff into cavity of each quail.  Spread preserves over quail and then wrap each with 1 bacon strip.

Roast in a 400 degree oven for 12 minutes or until bacon is just brown.  Serve with bacon intact.

Comments:  Be careful not to overstuff the quail or they may take too long to cook.  You may want to double the stuffing ingredients and serve some extra on the side.  Look for pumpkin seeds in the bulk bin of your supermarket.

                Salmon                          Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless salmon fillets - (4 oz ea)
                        = (each abt 1/4" to 1/2" thick)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4         tablespoon  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  8             slices  sourdough bread -- toasted
  12                    strips bacon -- cooked, drained,
                        and cooled
  4             pieces  romaine or iceberg lettuce
  4             slices  vine-ripened tomatoes

Season fillets with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Place fillets in skillet, cover skillet and cook for about 4 minutes or until fish are cooked throughout without flipping over.

Combine mayonnaise with basil and lemon juice and spread mixture evenly on each slice of bread.  Build sandwich as you would a traditional BLT, starting with warm cooked salmon fillet.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I stole this idea from The Colony House Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina many years ago.  It's one of America's all-time favorite sandwiches made even better with the addition of freshly caught salmon.  I like to serve this with cool summer melons and a glass of crisp dry white wine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  minced pickled ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  1                     lime -- juice only
  1           teaspoon  Rose's lime juice
  1         tablespoon  prepared wasabi paste - (to 2)
     1/2           cup  heavy (whipping) cream

Season salmon on both sides with salt and white pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add salmon and brown on both sides.  Remove fish from pan and keep warm.

Add wine remaining ingredients except cream.  Reduce liquid to just a few tablespoons and then add cream.  Bring to a boil and continue to cook until sauce is thick and creamy.

To serve, place salmon on plate and drizzle sauce over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The Fred Hall Fishing, Tackle and Boat Shows takes place each year in Long Beach, Del Mar and Ventura California.  If you're looking for the latest in fishing and boating stuff, this is the place.  I was invited to share some of my recipes for those who attended the shows.  By far, the most popular recipe was fish with wasabi cream sauce.  Fortunately for all of us, Capt. Ron Baker of southern California's Fish Talk Radio donated a pair of beautiful freshly caught salmon to use for the demonstrations.  There's a big difference in flavor and texture between the sea-going "real" salmon and the ones raised commercially.  The real fish are darker, less fatty, firmer and much better tasting.  Salmon is not in my top ten list of favorite fish, unless it's a Pacific Ocean fish.

At first glance, many will think that the quantity of wasabi specified may be a typographical error.  Japanese horseradish is known for its sinus clearing properties.  A little too much will make your eyes water.  When combined with heavy cream, pickled ginger and sweetened lime juice the flavor is subtler and you lose much of the heat.  Start with a tablespoon of prepared wasabi and then keep adding more until it suits your taste.  You can use either the dry wasabi powder that is mixed with cold water to make a paste, or the prepared stuff in the tube.  The goo in the tube is milder.

                    Sauteed Crappie With Butter Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     crappie fillets - (3 oz ea) -- skin removed
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  white pepper
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  5        tablespoons  butter -- chilled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                     lemon -- juice only
     1/3           cup  fresh basil leaves
  8             slices  tomato - (abt 1/4" thick)
  1                     avocado -- cut thin slices

Combine flour, salt, white pepper and garlic powder in a small bowl.  Dust fish with flour mixture.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add fish and brown on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Flip fish over and cook for 2 more minutes.  Remove fish and keep warm.

Add wine and lemon juice and stir to loosen bits stuck to pan.  Reduce liquid to just a few tablespoons.  Stir in basil and remaining chilled butter, stirring until butter is melted.  Remove from heat.

For each serving, arrange 1 slice of tomato on a plate.  Top with 1 piece of fish and then avocado slices.  Place tomato over avocado, then fish and then 2 mores slices avocado.  Drizzle butter sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This tasty recipe works just as well with any type of fish that won't fall apart when you sautÈ it.  If your tomatoes are not home-grown, help them out by slicing them into thick slices and then seasoning with salt, pepper, sugar and a splash of balsamic vinegar.

                 Sesame Coated Tuna With Wasabi Soy Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Seafood                         Tuna


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pieces  tuna loin - (2" dia by 5" long)
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  low-salt soy sauce
     1/2           cup  sesame seeds
                        = (buy in the Asian or Hispanic part of
                        your market ñ much cheaper!)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable or olive oil
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  low-salt soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced pickled ginger
                        = (or 1 tspn minced fresh ginger)
  3        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  prepared wasabi paste -- or more to taste
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  brown sugar
  2                     green onions -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  cold water

To prepare sauce, combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes to thicken.

To prepare fish, combine Dijon mustard with next two ingredients.  Coat fish with mixture.  Spread sesame seeds on a plate and roll coated fish in seeds.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add fish and lightly brown each side.  Do not cook fish more than a few minutes.  When properly cooked, only the outside 1/8-inch is cooked.  Most of the center is still raw (call it "rare" if it makes you feel better).

To serve, spoon sauce onto plates.  Carefully slice tuna into medallions and arrange over sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Super fresh, just-caught yellowfin/ahi tuna.  It does get better than that, but it may not be legal in your state.  When it is good and fresh, I rarely cook it at all.  If you do cook it thoroughly, it will taste like the stuff in the can.

To prepare sauce, combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes to thicken.

To prepare fish, combine Dijon mustard with next two ingredients.  Coat fish with mixture.  Spread sesame seeds on a plate and roll coated fish in seeds.

<DirT>
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add fish and lightly brown each side.  Do not cook fish more than a few minutes.  When properly cooked, only the outside 1/8-inch is cooked.  Most of the center is still raw (call it &quot;rare&quot; if it makes you feel better).

To serve, spoon sauce onto plates.  Carefully slice tuna into medallions and arrange over sauce.

Comments:  Super fresh, just-caught yellowfin/ahi tuna.  It does get better than that, but it may not be legal in your state.  When it is good and fresh, I rarely cook it at all.  If you do cook it thoroughly, it will taste like the stuff in the can.

                           Sesame Crusted Duck

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Waterfowl
                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     duck breast halves - (to 8) -- skinned or not
     1/2           cup  whole grain or Dijon-style mustard
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sesame seeds
  3        tablespoons  oil
                        = (preferably peanut oil)

In a medium bowl, combine pepper, salt and sesame seeds.  Coat each breast with mustard.  Press each breast evenly into seed mixture, coating both sides with seeds.

In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil and cook each breast on both sides until sesame seeds turn golden brown.  Turn each side gently only once to keep seed crust intact.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Here's an easy favorite from the first The Sporting Chef cookbook.  Six ingredients and about fifteen minutes of preparation and cooking time.

Buy your sesame seeds in the plastic bags hanging in the Hispanic section of the grocery store rather than in the regular spice section.  They are a lot cheaper!

                        Sesame Duck Leg Appetizer

Categories    : Appetizers                      Waterfowl
                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  25                    duck legs - (to 30)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- minced
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1 1/2           cups  pineapple juice
     3/4           cup  rice vinegar
  1                cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds
                        Pan spray -- as needed

Coat a large baking dish evenly with pay spray.  Add duck legs and place in a preheated 400 degree oven, covered with foil or lid, for 1 hour.  Remove pan from oven and pour off any liquid in pan.

Combine remaining ingredients and pour over legs, just enough to barely cover them.  Reserve any extra liquid.  Cover and place back in the oven for 1 1/2 hours, checking occasionally to make sure that the liquid does not cook out of the pan completely.  Add additional liquid, if necessary.

After 1 1/2 hours, check the legs every 20 minutes until the meat pulls off the bone with moderate pressure, but don't wait until the meat falls off the bone.  Allow to cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Duck legs take a lot of cooking time to render tender.  Save up your duck legs in a separate bag and make this recipe when you have a bunch of folks coming over for a duck dinner.

Categories    : Big Game                        Chili
                Main Dish                       Venison


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  linguica sausage -- diced
  2              pound  venison shoulder roast -- trimmed of excess
                        fat and gristle and then cut 1/2" cubes
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  8                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     green bell peppers -- seeded, diced
  2                     jalapeno peppers -- seeded, and
                        finely diced
  1              quart  canned diced tomato with juice
  1                cup  canned diced roasted green chiles
  1              quart  green chile salsa
                        = (or substitute tomato salsa)
  2        tablespoons  chile powder
  2          teaspoons  cumin
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano flakes
  3               cups  cooked pinto beans -- drained
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste - (to 4)
     1/4          cups  fresh cilantro -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Tabasco -- to taste

In a large stockpot over medium heat, add linguica and cook until lightly browned.  Add venison and brown evenly.  Add next 4 ingredients and cook for a few minutes.  Add diced tomato and next 5 ingredients and simmer until venison is tender.  It will take 2 to 3 hours.  Add additional salsa or tomato if necessary to keep meat moist while cooking.

When meat is just tender, add beans, 2 tablespoons of the tomato paste and cilantro.  Heat to warm beans.  If you want to thicken the chili, add additional tomato paste as necessary.  Season with salt, pepper and Tabasco.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Silver Sage Caterers, founded by Greg Cornell and me, receives more requests for the chili recipe than any other item we prepare.  Leftovers have been auctioned off at dinners we've catered for sporting groups such as California Waterfowl Association.

For our signature beans, we use chunks of sirloin and linguica sausage.  We substitute cubed venison shoulder for beef for this version.  If you can't find linguica, use andouille or any good-quality smoked medium-hot sausage.  If your sausage does not release a good bit of oil when cooked, you should add some vegetable oil to help brown the venison.

I like to serve this with warm flour tortillas.  It is important to stew the venison until tender.  To do so, you may need to add some more diced tomato or salsa so that there is sufficient liquid to keep the meat moist while cooking.

                 Spicy Asian Tuna Burger With Wasabi Mayo

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Seafood                         Tuna


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh tuna -- cut 1" to 2" pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  Lawry's Seasoned Salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  minced onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced pickled ginger
  1         tablespoon  Asian chili sauce - (to 2)
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  Japanese breadcrumbs (panko)
                        = (or sub "regular" breadcrumbs)
                        === WASABI MAYONNAISE ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  1                     lime -- juice only
  1              pinch  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  prepared wasabi paste -- or more to taste

In a food processor, pulse tuna until the meat is in pieces about the size of a garbanzo bean.  Add to a bowl with all of the remaining ingredients except the breadcrumbs.  Using your hands, combine ingredients.  Add breadcrumbs and mix with hands.

Form a ball about 4 inches in diameter.  Press together to form a patty about 3/4- to 1-inch thick.  If the patty is too moist, add a little more breadcrumbs.  If it's too dry, add some mayonnaise.

Patties can be grilled, broiled or pan-seared.  Serve on a bun with fresh tomato, lettuce, red onion and wasabi mayonnaise.

Wasabi Mayonnaise:  Combine all ingredients to make mayonnaise.  If you like it hot, add more wasabi, but remember that the patties have some heat also.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Many folks waste a good portion of their caught tuna.  They save the center loins and discard some pretty tasty meat.  The trim around the choicest parts can be made into these great tuna burgers.  Avoid the very dark flesh and blood lines.

In a food processor, pulse tuna until the meat is in pieces about the size of a garbanzo bean.  Add to a bowl with all of the remaining ingredients except the breadcrumbs.  Using your hands, combine ingredients.  Add breadcrumbs and mix with hands.

<DirT>
Form a ball about 4 inches in diameter.  Press together to form a patty about 3/4- to 1-inch thick.  If the patty is too moist, add a little more breadcrumbs.  If it&apos;s too dry, add some mayonnaise.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Patties can be grilled, broiled or pan-seared.  Serve on a bun with fresh tomato, lettuce, red onion and wasabi mayonnaise.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wasabi Mayonnaise:  Combine all ingredients to make mayonnaise.  If you like it hot, add more wasabi, but remember that the patties have some heat also.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Many folks waste a good portion of their caught tuna.  They save the center loins and discard some pretty tasty meat.  The trim around the choicest parts can be made into these great tuna burgers.  Avoid the very dark flesh and blood lines.

                  Spicy Salmon And Shrimp Eggs Benedict

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless salmon fillets - (4 oz ea)
  16             large  shrimp - (to 20) -- peeled, deveined
     1/4           cup  Cajun or Creole seasoning blend
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     English muffin halves -- toasted, and
                        lightly buttered
  8             slices  ripe tomato
  4                     poached eggs
                        === HOLLANDAISE SAUCE ===
  3                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1                cup  butter -- melted and hot

To make hollandaise sauce, place egg yolks, mustard and lemon juice in a blender or food processor and process until well blended.  While motor is running, add hot butter, a few drops at a time and then increasing to a slow, steady stream until all butter is incorporated and sauce is smooth.

Season salmon and shrimp with seasoning blend.  Heat oil in a large skillet and lightly brown salmon on 1 side.  Flip over and add prawns to pan.  Continue cooking until salmon and prawns are just cooked.

For each serving, place 2 English muffin halves on each plate.  Top with 2 tomato slices.  Add 1 piece salmon and 4 to 5 prawns.  Top with 1 poached egg.  Drizzle sauce over top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you've ever tried to make hollandaise sauce using the classic method of whisking the ingredients constantly over a double boiler, you know how tedious it can be.  Well, you have got to try my blender version of hollandaise sauce.  It's fool-proof (aka Scott-proof) and only takes about 1 minute.  After you have made the basic sauce, try playing with the recipe by adding herbs, shallots, cheese, etc.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Small Game
                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     wild turkey breast halves -- boned, skinned,
                        and butterflied
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  jack cheese
     1/2                red onion -- diced
  2                     limes -- juice only
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  seasoned breadcrumbs
                        = (or cornmeal stuffing)
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, diced fine
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves
  1                cup  tomato salsa

Season turkey breasts liberally with salt and pepper.  In a bowl, combine remaining ingredients except salsa.  Place some of the stuffing mixture, about 1/4-inch thick, evenly on each breast.  Starting from one end, roll the breast tightly, tucking in the ends with your fingertips as you roll.

Place each breast, seam-side down, in a greased shallow baking dish.  Cover with lid or foil and bake in a 375 degree oven for 18 to 24 minutes, depending upon the size of the breasts.

When cooked, allow the breasts to rest for a few minutes and then slice each into 3 to 4 sections.  Serve with salsa.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  While living in Arizona during the mid to late 70's, I developed a taste, more like a craving, for Southwestern flavors.  I like it spicy, but not so hot that my eyes water.  Some folks can enjoy a habanero pepper or two.  I'm not one of them.

To butterfly each breast half, place it on a flat surface, press down slightly with the palm of your left hand (if you're right-handed)Ökeep your fingers up and away from the knife bladeÖslice through the breast between your palm and the table along the long edge, but not all of the way through.  The idea is to make a hinge so that you can open the breast up like a book.

                     Stuffed Elk With Port Wine Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  elk tenderloin -- silver skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese
     1/4           cup  breadcrumbs
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     green onions -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh rosemary
                        === SAUCE ===
  3               cups  port wine
  2                     shallots -- minced
                        = (or substitute the white part of 3
                        green onions)
  2                     fresh rosemary sprigs - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare sauce, combine first 3 ingredients in a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and reduce liquid, uncovered, to 1 cup.  Strain out rosemary and shallots.  Add sugar and cream and continue to reduce liquid to about 1 cup.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cut elk into 4 relatively equal-sized pieces.  With a sharp boning knife, cut a slit into each piece to form a pocket.  Season inside and out with salt and pepper.

In a bowl, combine cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic, onions and rosemary and stuff inside each piece of tenderloin.  Place enough stuffing in each so that it is evenly distributed, but not overstuffed.  You should be able to close the seam where you made the pocket.

Place each seam-side down in a baking pan.  Roast in a preheated 400 degree oven for 7 to 8 minutes or until meat is evenly browned.  Remove from oven and let stand for 3 to 4 minutes.

To serve, slice each stuffed tenderloin into 3 pieces.  Arrange on plates.  Spoon sauce over part of meat and spoon extra sauce onto plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe calls for elk tenderloin, but you can use just about any of the large sections excised from the hindquarter or ham.  The key is to remove all visible gristle, silver skin, etc.  You'll find that you have beautiful hunks of meat, the texture and taste of which is comparable to the tenderloin.

To prepare sauce, combine first 3 ingredients in a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and reduce liquid, uncovered, to 1 cup.  Strain out rosemary and shallots.  Add sugar and cream and continue to reduce liquid to about 1 cup.  Season with salt and pepper.

<DirT>
Cut elk into 4 relatively equal-sized pieces.  With a sharp boning knife, cut a slit into each piece to form a pocket.  Season inside and out with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, combine cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic, onions and rosemary and stuff inside each piece of tenderloin.  Place enough stuffing in each so that it is evenly distributed, but not overstuffed.  You should be able to close the seam where you made the pocket.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place each seam-side down in a baking pan.  Roast in a preheated 400 degree oven for 7 to 8 minutes or until meat is evenly browned.  Remove from oven and let stand for 3 to 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, slice each stuffed tenderloin into 3 pieces.  Arrange on plates.  Spoon sauce over part of meat and spoon extra sauce onto plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This recipe calls for elk tenderloin, but you can use just about any of the large sections excised from the hindquarter or ham.  The key is to remove all visible gristle, silver skin, etc.  You&apos;ll find that you have beautiful hunks of meat, the texture and taste of which is comparable to the tenderloin.

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fish fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  peanut or vegetable oil
  2                     green onions -- diced
  1           teaspoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, sliced thin
  2             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and then cut into 1" pieces
  1                     red bell pepper -- sliced into rings
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  fish or chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  apricot preserves
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  cold water
  1 1/2           cups  cubed (1") fresh pineapple
  4               cups  warm cooked rice

Heat oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat.  Add green onions, ginger and garlic.  Cook for 1 minute.  Add fish fillets and lightly brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.

Add cut carrots, zucchini and bell pepper.  Cook for 1 minute.  Add soy sauce, fish or chicken broth, vinegar, apricot preserves and cornstarch mixture.  Add pineapple and return fish to the pan to warm.

To serve, place fish, vegetables and sauce over rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The idea is to create a dish that is flavorful, colorful and low in calories.  If you don't have the exact ingredients, don't hesitate to make substitutions with whatever looks good in the market.

Either a wok or a decent large non-stick skillet will work for this dish.  Adjust the flavor of the sauce to your liking by adding more apricot preserves or rice vinegar -- the sweet and sour parts.

                       Trout With Herb Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish
                Trout

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     trout - (16 oz ea) -- butterflied
                        = (weight after cleaning, head-on)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh herbs

Season fish with salt and pepper.  Combine remaining ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously.  Baste the fish with the stuff in the jar and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Place fish, skin-side down on a medium heat barbecue.  Cover with lid or foil for 5 minutes, baste again and give the fish a quarter turn with a spatula.  Cover again and cook for 5 minutes more.  Fish should be done throughout.  Remove bones and serve with vinaigrette on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  You can bake it, broil it, sautÈ it, pan-sear it, blacken it or throw it on the grill.  Personally, I prefer to cook it on the grill to smoky fruit wood coals along with some sweet bell peppers and red onions, but you do what you want.  If your trout is dry, don't blame it on the fish -- you've overcooked it.

If you have trouble with fish sticking to the grill when you barbecue, make sure that the grate is clean and hot.  The fish is much more likely to stick to a grill that is not very hot.  If that still doesn't work, dust the fish with a little seasoned flour before grilling.  If that doesn't work, give up and put the fish under the broiler.

To butterfly your trout, use a sharp boning knife and, starting at the head, run the knife between both sides and the spine.  This will separate the bones from the spine and fish can be opened up flat.  After cooking, the bones can be easily removed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  venison loin -- all fat, gristle
                        and silver skin removed
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-cracked black peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  beef broth or game stock
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh rosemary
  2               cups  fresh ripe strawberries -- quartered

Season venison with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and sear venison evenly until browned, but not cooked beyond rare.

Add beef broth to the pan and stir to loosen bits.  Add red wine and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove venison from pan.

Add vinegar, garlic and rosemary and reduce liquid by about two-thirds.  Return venison to pan to warm.  Add strawberries and cook about 1 minute.

To serve, slice venison into medallions and top with strawberries and sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  From time to time and occasionally on a commission basis, I create special recipes for special companies and extraordinary people.  Elizabeth "Libbie" McLain is one of those special people.  She was instrumental in the production and design of the first The Sporting Chef website.  Libbie is an extremely creative and entertaining friend, but I think she'd rather eat a cheeseburger than Venison Elizabeth.  She's not too adventurous when it comes to food.

Comments:  From time to time and occasionally on a commission basis, I create special recipes for special companies and extraordinary people.  Elizabeth &quot;Libbie&quot; McLain is one of those special people.  She was instrumental in the production and design of the first The Sporting Chef website.  Libbie is an extremely creative and entertaining friend, but I think she&apos;d rather eat a cheeseburger than Venison Elizabeth.  She&apos;s not too adventurous when it comes to food.

                  Venison Medallions With Mushroom Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath

Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSHROOM SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2           cup  chicken broth -- cool
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
     1/2           cup  diced red and green bell pepper
  2                     green onions, white and green part -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  thinly-sliced fresh mushrooms
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VENISON MEDALLIONS ===
  12                    venison medallions - (2 to 3 oz ea)
                        = (cut from the loin or eye of round)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             sprigs  Italian parsley

Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in flour and cook while stirring until butter/flour mixture is smooth and beige in color, about 3 to 5 minutes.

Stir in cool chicken broth, a little at a time, until incorporated.  Stir in wine and cream until incorporated.  Add remaining sauce ingredients and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring often.

Season medallions with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add medallions and sear on both sides until medium-rare.

To serve, spoon sauce on to plate, arrange medallions over sauce and garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Anyone notice how I poke fun at game recipes that call for a can of cream of mushroom soup?  Well here's my upgraded version of the oversalted stuff in a can.  The sauce is a velvety blend of fresh mushrooms, wine, cream and vegetables.  Once you see just how easy it is to make the real deal, you'll think twice about using the canned goo in the future.

               Venison With Cranberry Sweet And Sour Sauce

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath

Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     venison steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- trimmed of all fat,
                        gristle and bone
                        === SAUCE ===
  1             bottle  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1              pound  fresh cranberries
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  2             sprigs  rosemary
  1                     shallot -- minced
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Prepare sauce.  To large saucepan, add red wine and next 5 ingredients.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, uncovered.  Lower to medium heat and reduce liquid by one-half.  Remove rosemary and allow mixture to cool.

When cooled, transfer contents to a blender or food processor and puree.  If you wish, you can strain the liquid through a strainer to remove any large pieces.  Do not attempt to process the HOT sauce in the blender or processor!  It has to be cool.  As soon as you turn on the machine, hot liquid cranberry sauce will spew out of the top and burn you and/or make a really big mess.

Return processed sauce to the saucepan and add brown sugar and half of the cornstarch mixture.  Heat to boil.  Add additional cornstarch mixture to thicken, if needed.  Adjust sweet and sour flavors as desired by adding additional balsamic vinegar (sour) or brown sugar (sweet).  Season with salt and pepper.

Season venison with salt and pepper.  Grill, broil or pan sear until medium-rare.  Spoon a little sauce on each plate.  Slice venison across the grain and arrange slices over sauce.  Garnish with additional cranberries, fresh herb, orange slice, etc.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cooking with cranberries during the holiday season makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Cranberries are a decent source of vitamin C and potassium.  They are supposedly good for blood circulation, digestive system, urinary tract and the complexion, although I wouldn't recommend rubbing them over your face.  I like them because they taste and look good.  Pop a fresh cranberry in your mouth, go ahead, and try it!  Not too good is it?  They are a bit tart so it's best to pair them with something sweet, in this case brown sugar, to balance the acidic tartness.  You may want to save a few of the cooked ones for garnish before processing in the blender.

                Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  trimmed venison loin or
                        trimmed ham sections
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped
  1                     bell pepper -- sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  Asian chili-garlic paste
  2        tablespoons  creamy peanut butter
  4               cups  warm cooked white rice

Season meat with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add deer and brown evenly until meat is rare.  Remove meat from skillet.

Add next 3 ingredients and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Stir in remaining ingredients and cook while stirring until smooth, about 2 minutes more.  Reduce heat to low.

Slice meat across the "grain" into 1/2-inch thick medallions.  Return sliced meat to pan and heat through, but not beyond medium-rare.  Serve with steamed rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I know what you're thinking.  What fool would cook deer meat with peanut butter?  Well, now you know.  Just another in a long series of examples of how we can expand our game-cooking culinary horizons.

This preparation works best with the loins and the thoroughly cleaned and trimmed portions of the hindquarters.  If your game processor makes a habit of hacking through your bone-in hindquarters with a band saw, ask him to stop or find another processor.  Deer "steaks" should be carefully trimmed of all fat, etc. before slicing.  Within each hindquarter or "ham" portion of the deer is a delectable hunk of meat that will eat like loin if properly prepared.  If you plan on overcooking your venison beyond medium-rare, you will be severely punished.

                Sandwiches                      Venison


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground venison
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  onion -- finely diced
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped mushrooms
     1/2           cup  blue cheese crumbles
  2        tablespoons  breadcrumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     burger buns
  4                     lettuce leaves
  4             slices  tomato

Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic until onions are translucent.  Stir in mushrooms and sautÈ until soft.  Transfer to a medium bowl and allow to cool.

Add ground venison, blue cheese, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper and mix well with your hands to blend.  Form into 4 large patties.

Grill, pan-fry or broil patties until browned.  Add to bun with lettuce, tomato and your choice of other condiments.

This recipe yields 4 big burgers.

Comments:  Complaints are common regarding the lack of flavor from ground venison.  The meat is very lean and can suffer miserably from overcooking.  I often add some ground fatty meat to my ground venison to add flavor and moisture.  In this instance, I have used a creamy cheese, onions and mushrooms for flavor.

While most of us prefer to have our meat ground for us by a game processor shortly after harvest, you'll discover that freshly ground meat tastes better than previously ground and then frozen burger.  You can also trim up hunks of meat, freeze it and then thaw and grind into burger before cooking.

                             Venistrone Soup

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Soups/Stews                     Venison


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  venison stew meat - (to 3) -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" cubes and seasoned with salt
                        and pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     yellow onion -- coarsely chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             quarts  beef broth
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  diced tomatoes -- fresh or canned
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
  1                cup  diced carrots
  1                cup  diced celery
  1 1/2           cups  canned kidney beans
  1                cup  canned garbanzo beans
  1 1/2            cup  elbow macaroni
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmesan cheese

Heat oil in a large stockpot and add venison, cooking until evenly browned.  Add onion and garlic and cook for a few minutes more.  Add next 5 ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.  Cover and simmer until meat begins to break apart easily.

Add carrots, celery and beans.  Cook 10 minutes.  Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes.  Serve in bowls and top with Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Some parts of a deer are just too tough for the "fast and hot" method of cooking.  Cuts from the shoulder, neck and shanks are best suited to stewing and braising.  And so we have my own simplified version of the classic Italian minestrone soupÖvenistrone.  Cute name, but does it taste good?  Yeah, Baby!  Don't forget to carefully trim the meat.  Gristle, fat and sinew don't taste good no matter how you cook them.

                           Wild Pig Enchiladas

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Main Dish
                Wild Boar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless wild pig loins - (2 1/2 lbs ea)
  8                     garlic cloves - (to 10) -- minced
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
     1/3           cup  tequila
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Tabasco sauce -- as desired
  1             medium  yellow onion -- chopped
  3               cups  homemade or canned enchilada sauce
  8                     corn tortillas
  2               cups  grated peppered jack cheese
  1                cup  diced fresh tomato

Poke holes throughout the loins.  Combine the next 10 ingredients in a non-reactive bowl.  Place loins in bowl and toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.

Place loins in a medium-low heat smoker or barbecue and slow-cook until internal temperature is about 150 degrees, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove and place in a baking dish, cover with onions and enchilada sauce and bake in a 375 degree oven for 1 hour or until meat starts to fall apart.

Dip tortillas in pan sauce.  Place pulled meat and a little cheese in each tortilla.  Roll up and place seam-side down in a baking dish.  Top with remaining sauce and cheese and bake in a 375 degree oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In my opinion, the best way to cook wild pig or boar is by slow roasting or slow smoking over natural wood coals.  Something about the flavor of seasoned smoky fall-off-the-bone pig just makes my mouth water.

The smoking/roasting method takes a little time, but it's well worth it.  If you don't have a smoker, use any non-propane barbecue and drop a few moist wood chunks onto the coals before adding meat.

I've specified a pair of 2 to 3 pound loins, but you may use any cut available.  The only variable will be cooking times.  Larger bone-in cuts will require more time to reach the tender stage.  There will be more than enough cooked meat for the enchiladas.  Use the leftovers for a great sandwich!

             Wild Turkey Breast Stir-Fry With Dried Cherries

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Small Game
                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     wild turkey breasts -- boned, skinned,
                        and cut into thin strips
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  orange juice
                        = (preferably freshly squeezed)
     1/4           cup  sake or dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  1                     lemon -- juice only
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  dry-roasted peanuts
  2                     green onions -- roughly chopped
  1                cup  snow peas -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  dried cherries
  1                can  sliced water chestnuts - (8 oz)
  4               cups  warm steamed rice

Combine sesame oil, vegetable oil, soy sauce, orange juice, sake (or sherry), lemon juice, garlic, ginger and brown sugar in a non-reactive bowl (glass, wood, plastic).  Add turkey, toss to coat and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.

Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Remove turkey from marinade.  Reserve marinade.  Add turkey and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove turkey from pan.

Add reserved marinade and heat liquid to boiling for 5 minutes.  Return turkey to the pan and add peanuts, snow peas, dried cherries, water chestnuts and heat to warm.  Serve immediately over rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The reason I included dried cherries in the title of this recipe is because most people would not combine berries with an Asian stir-fry.  I was torn between creating a stuffed turkey breast, specifically a turkey breast with a dried cherry stuffing or a stir-fry.  Not wanting to do without either, I combined the flavors of the East and, wellÖdried cherries.

While feasting on the finished product, I found myself hoping that each bite would have a dried cherry.  If you can't easily get your hands on dried cherries, try "Craisins" -- a sweetened cranberry, raisins or just about any dried fruit.  Keep an eye on the turkey since it cooks very quickly.  When it is just about done, pull it out and return it to the pan just before serving.

Comments:  The reason I included dried cherries in the title of this recipe is because most people would not combine berries with an Asian stir-fry.  I was torn between creating a stuffed turkey breast, specifically a turkey breast with a dried cherry stuffing or a stir-fry.  Not wanting to do without either, I combined the flavors of the East and, wellÖdried cherries.

While feasting on the finished product, I found myself hoping that each bite would have a dried cherry.  If you can&apos;t easily get your hands on dried cherries, try &quot;Craisins&quot; -- a sweetened cranberry, raisins or just about any dried fruit.  Keep an eye on the turkey since it cooks very quickly.  When it is just about done, pull it out and return it to the pan just before serving.

                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     wild turkey breasts -- skin removed
  1                cup  dry sherry
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/3           cup  peanut or soy oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6               cups  warm cooked rice
                        === CHUTNEY ===
  6             medium  firm peaches -- peeled, seeded,
                        diced and chopped into 1" to 2" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                     jalapeÒo peppers - (to 2) -- seeded, minced fine
                        = (you decide how hot you want it)
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  white vinegar
  2           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  roasted pecans -- chopped

Combine sherry with next 5 ingredients.  Add to turkey in a plastic, ceramic or glass bowl.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.

Prepare chutney.  Combine all ingredients and simmer for 1 hour or until peaches are soft.

Remove turkey from marinade and discard marinade.  Breasts can be baked or grilled, but do not cook beyond 150 degrees.  Allow the cooked breasts to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

To serve, mound some rice on each plate.  Slice turkey and arrange slices over rice.  Spoon chutney onto turkey.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Please stop overcooking your wild turkey!  When overdone, the meat is dry, tough and chewy.  Then you have to throw it into the crockpot and cook it for several weeks.

Just because this recipe is about cooking wild turkey breasts, it doesn't mean you should discard the rest of the bird.  The bodies and thighs are great for making stocks, soups and stews and the legs make great Billy clubs.

Fresh peaches and wild turkeys are not usually "harvested" at the same time.  Feel free to substitute other fresh or frozen fruits such as nectarines, pears, plums or apricots.  In a pinch, dried fruits will work as well.

                  Wild Turkey Breast With Tons Of Garlic

                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     wild turkey breasts - (to 3) -- skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  20             whole  garlic cloves -- skin removed
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1                cup  diced seeded fresh tomato

Season turkey breasts with salt and pepper.  Heat half of the oil and half of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add turkey breasts and cook until lightly browned on one side.  Flip over and cook for 3 minutes more.  Add 1/2 cup of the wine and lemon juice and stir to remove any bits stuck to the pan.  Remove turkey breasts when just cooked and internal temperature reaches 150 degrees.  Cover and keep warm.

Add garlic, remaining 1/2 cup of wine and remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Cook until garlic cloves soften, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Whisk in remaining butter, basil and cheese.  Continue whisking until butter is melted.  Remove pan from heat.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

To serve, slice turkey breasts and arrange on plates.  Spoon sauce over turkey and top with diced tomato.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Garlic is good.  Egyptians fed it to their slaves to give them the endurance it takes to build a pyramid.  I eat it because it tastes good and it keeps others from getting too close to me when I'm talking to them.  This dish is all about garlic, tons of garlic.  If you don't want tons of garlic, use less garlic.

If you really want to mellow out the garlic, coat the cloves with olive oil, place them in a pan in a 325 degree oven for about 20 to 30 minutes.  When the cloves turn golden brown, take them out and allow to cool.  The flavor will be sweet and nutty.  If you leave them in the oven too long and they turn dark brown, they will taste bitter and bad.

I serve this with a steamy pile of mashed potatoes.
