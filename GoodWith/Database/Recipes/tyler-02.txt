Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 25    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shelled walnuts -- toasted
     1/2         pound  blanched almonds -- toasted
     1/2         pound  shelled pistachios -- toasted
     2/3           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1              pound  unsalted butter -- melted
  1              pound  phyllo pastry sheets
                        === ORANGE SCENTED SIMPLE SYRUP ===
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  orange blossom honey
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2                     large strips orange peel
  1                     cinnamon stick
  3                     whole cloves

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Finely chop the nuts in a food processor or coffee grinder.  Transfer nuts to a bowl and mix in brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and cloves.

Brush a 13- by 9-inch baking pan with melted butter and set aside.  Cut a piece of cardboard into a 13- by 9-inch rectangle.  Unroll the phyllo dough and lay the sheets flat on a work surface.  Set the cardboard template on the stack of phyllo and trim the excess so they fit the pan.  Keep the pastry covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out.

To build the baklava, you will alternate 3 layers of dough with 2 layers of nuts.  Start with a stable base of 8 sheets on the bottom, brushing each with melted butter.  Spread 1/2 the nut mixture evenly over the stacked sheets.  Cover with 4 sheets of phyllo, painting each with melted butter, then sprinkle again with remaining nut mixture.  Top the last layer of nuts with 8 layers of phyllo as you did for the bottom.  Drizzle any remaining butter over top.

If you have time, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes so the butter will set and make the baklava easier to cut.  Using a sharp knife, make 5 cuts across lengthwise, then cut diagonally to form diamonds.  Baklava is more difficult to cut after it is cooked because the pastry becomes so flaky.  Bake for about 40 minutes until golden and flaky.  If the top browns too quickly during baking, tent with foil.

To make the Orange Scented Simple Syrup:  Combine the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and let simmer for 10 minutes until thickened.  Remove the orange peel, cinnamon stick, and whole clove; set aside to cool.

Remove an end piece of the baklava and tilt the pan to allow the butter to collect in the corner.  Spoon out the excess and discard.  With the pan flat, pour the syrup evenly over the hot baklava.  Allow to stand for several hours before serving.

This recipe yields about 50 pieces, 25 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef shoulder roast
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     onions -- peeled, sliced
  1                     garlic bulb -- cloves removed,
                        and peeled
  4             ounces  dried New Mexico chilies
  2             ounces  ancho chiles
  2             ounces  pasilla chiles
  2        tablespoons  cumin seed -- toasted
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2                     bags dried corn husks - (abt 3 dozen)
  4               cups  masa mix
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4               cups  reserved beef broth -- warm
  1                cup  vegetable shortening

Season the beef shoulder all over with salt and pepper then brown in a large heavy pot over medium heat.  Once browned on all sides, add enough water to cover the roast along with the 1 sliced onion and about 6 cloves of garlic.  Cook until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours.  When done, remove the roast to a platter to cool, reserve the beef broth.  Hand shred the meat and set aside.

To prepare the sauce, remove the tops of the dried chilies and shake out most of the seeds.  Place the chilies in a large stockpot and cover them with water.  Add the cumin, remaining sliced onion and garlic.  Boil for 20 minutes until the chiles are very soft.  Transfer the chiles to a blender using tongs and add a ladle full of the chile water (it is best to do this in batches.)  Puree the chiles until smooth.  Pass the pureed chiles through a strainer to remove the remaining seeds and skins.  Pour the chili sauce into a large bowl and add salt, stir to incorporate.  Taste to check seasonings, add more if necessary.  Add the shredded beef to the bowl of chili sauce, and mix thoroughly.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Go through the dried cornhusks, separate them and discard the silk, be careful since the husks are fragile when dry.  Soak them in a sink filled with warm water for 30 minutes to soften.  In a deep bowl, combine the masa, baking powder, and salt.  Pour the broth into the masa a little at a time, working it in with your fingers.  In a small bowl, beat the vegetable shortening until fluffy.  Add it to the masa and beat until the dough has a spongy texture.

Rinse, drain, and dry the corn husks.  Set them out on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel along with the bowls of masa dough and beef in chili sauce.  Start with the largest husks because they are easier to roll.  Lay the husk flat on a plate or in your hand with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you.  Spread a thin, even layer of masa over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon dipped in water.  Do not use too much!  Add about a tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of the masa.  Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling.  The sticky masa will form a seal.  Pinch the wide top closed.

Stand the tamales up in a large steamer or colander with the pinched end up.  Load the steamer into a large pot filled with 2-inches of water.  The water should not touch the tamales.  Lay a damp cloth over the tamales and cover with lid.  Keep the water at a low boil, checking periodically to make sure the water doesn't boil away.  Steam the tamales for 2 hours.

The tamales are done when the inside pulls away from the husk.  The tamale should be soft, firm and not mushy.  To serve, unfold the husk and spoon about a tablespoon of remaining beef filling on top.

This recipe yields 3 dozen.

Season the beef shoulder all over with salt and pepper then brown in a large heavy pot over medium heat.  Once browned on all sides, add enough water to cover the roast along with the 1 sliced onion and about 6 cloves of garlic.  Cook until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours.  When done, remove the roast to a platter to cool, reserve the beef broth.  Hand shred the meat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the sauce, remove the tops of the dried chilies and shake out most of the seeds.  Place the chilies in a large stockpot and cover them with water.  Add the cumin, remaining sliced onion and garlic.  Boil for 20 minutes until the chiles are very soft.  Transfer the chiles to a blender using tongs and add a ladle full of the chile water (it is best to do this in batches.)  Puree the chiles until smooth.  Pass the pureed chiles through a strainer to remove the remaining seeds and skins.  Pour the chili sauce into a large bowl and add salt, stir to incorporate.  Taste to check seasonings, add more if necessary.  Add the shredded beef to the bowl of chili sauce, and mix thoroughly.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Go through the dried cornhusks, separate them and discard the silk, be careful since the husks are fragile when dry.  Soak them in a sink filled with warm water for 30 minutes to soften.  In a deep bowl, combine the masa, baking powder, and salt.  Pour the broth into the masa a little at a time, working it in with your fingers.  In a small bowl, beat the vegetable shortening until fluffy.  Add it to the masa and beat until the dough has a spongy texture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse, drain, and dry the corn husks.  Set them out on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel along with the bowls of masa dough and beef in chili sauce.  Start with the largest husks because they are easier to roll.  Lay the husk flat on a plate or in your hand with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you.  Spread a thin, even layer of masa over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon dipped in water.  Do not use too much!  Add about a tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of the masa.  Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling.  The sticky masa will form a seal.  Pinch the wide top closed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stand the tamales up in a large steamer or colander with the pinched end up.  Load the steamer into a large pot filled with 2-inches of water.  The water should not touch the tamales.  Lay a damp cloth over the tamales and cover with lid.  Keep the water at a low boil, checking periodically to make sure the water doesn&apos;t boil away.  Steam the tamales for 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The tamales are done when the inside pulls away from the husk.  The tamale should be soft, firm and not mushy.  To serve, unfold the husk and spoon about a tablespoon of remaining beef filling on top.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        more for greasing
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  milk -- hot
  4                     egg yolks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     3/4           cup  crumbled blue cheese
  5                     egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
                        Dried Figs In Simple Syrup -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins or a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish by greasing with softened butter and coating with Parmesan.

Make a thick bechamel sauce base by melting 3 tablespoons butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed saucepan.  Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste, do not allow to brown.

Add the hot milk to the roux and continue to whisk until the mixture is smoothly thickened.  Remove from heat.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time.  Season with salt, pepper, and mustard.  Stir in the cheese and incorporated evenly.  Chill while preparing the egg whites.

In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until they hold soft peaks.  Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the bechamel mixture to lighten it.  Then gently fold in the rest.

Pour into the prepared ramekins or souffle dish and place on a cookie sheet.  Bake on the middle rack for about 25 minutes.  The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden and the center giggles slightly.  Take care not to over bake.  Serve with Dried Figs In Simple Syrup, brioche, and bitter greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     center-cut bone-in pork roast - -- (abt 5 lbs)
  1             gallon  water
  1                cup  kosher salt
  1                cup  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  whole peppercorns
  1              bunch  fresh thyme -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  4                     carrots -- peeled
  1               head  garlic -- split
  1                     onion -- halved
  2                     shallots -- halved
  1              pound  sweet Italian sausage
  2                     garlic cloves -- slivered
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1              pinch  fennel seed
  1 1/2         pounds  broccoli rabe -- trimmed
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  whole mustard seed
  2        tablespoons  fresh tarragon
  1              dozen  peaches
  2               cups  apple juice
  1         tablespoon  butter

Have butcher cut the chine bone in between each rib of the pork roast to make carving easier.  Leave the fat cap on for added moisture and flavor.

Line a large stockpot or bucket with a plastic bag.  Pour water into the bag and dissolve salt and brown sugar.  Add peppercorns and a few thyme sprigs.  Place the pork roast in the bag of brine.  Tie the bag closed so the pork is submerged.  Refrigerate for 6 hours, the brine will tenderize the meat.  Remove pork from the brine and dry thoroughly with paper towels.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lay thyme sprigs all over the pork roast, season with salt and pepper, then secure with butcher's twine to help hold the shape.  Coat a roasting pan with a little olive oil and set on 2 burners over high heat until almost smoking.  Sear the pork, fat-side down, until caramelized.  Turn the roast to brown all sides, this should take about 10 minutes.

To flavor the pork drippings, scatter carrots, garlic, onion, shallots and more thyme sprigs in the pan, then transfer the roast to oven.  Roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast registers 150 degrees, approximately 1 hour.

Heat olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat.  Brown the sausage links on all sides until cooked through.  Remove the links from the pan and slice on a bias.  Add slivered garlic, red pepper flakes and fennel seed, stir to incorporate.  Return the sausage back to the pan, along with broccoli rabe and chicken broth.  Saute with the stock for 5 minutes until the rabe is wilted.

Whisk together balsamic vinegar, honey, mustard seed, tarragon, and about 1/4 cup olive oil.  Slice peaches in half lengthwise and remove pits.  Pour the marinade over the peaches, tossing to coat.  Place peaches cut-side down in a baking pan and roast for 12 to 15 minutes until soft.

Remove the pork to a cutting board and let it rest while preparing the pan sauce.  Discard the aromatic vegetables from the roasting pan, set pan on 2 burners over medium heat.  Deglaze with apple juice, scraping up the brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Reduce by a third.  Season with salt and pepper; whisk in butter to smooth out.

Cut the twine and carve the roast.  Serve family style on a platter with broccoli rabe, sausage, and roasted peaches.  Drizzle sauce over meat before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  artichokes
     1/2                lemon -- plus
  2                     lemons -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  vegetable broth or water
  2                     garlic cloves -- plus
  5                     garlic cloves -- sliced, divided
  4             sprigs  parsley -- chopped, plus
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  15            ounces  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  sun-dried tomatoes in oil -- chopped
  2               cups  fresh spinach leaves -- chopped
  1                     egg
  8             ounces  grated Pecorino Romano
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Wash artichokes under cold water.  Using a stainless steel knife, trim the outer part of the stems.  Pull off the lower petals that are small and tough.  Cut off the top inch of the artichoke then cut in half, top to bottom.  Rub with half a lemon to preserve the green color.

Put the oil, broth, garlic, lemon and herbs in a casserole pan.  Place the artichoke halves in the liquid face down.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes until tender.

In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, 3 cloves of sliced garlic and spinach.  Stir in the egg and about 6 ounces of cheese; season with salt and pepper.

In a separate bowl, combine bread crumbs, oil, remaining slices of garlic, remaining cheese and parsley; season with salt and pepper.

Remove the artichokes from the pan and carefully scoop out the chokes.  Fill the cavity of artichoke with the cheese mixture and place on a baking pan.  Sprinkle the tops with the bread crumb mixture.  Broil for 5 minutes until the cheese is warm and the crumbs are browned.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cubed day-old Italian bread
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  chopped Italian parsley
     1/2           cup  grated pecorino-Romano
  4                     garlic cloves -- slivered
     1/2         pound  copacola -- diced
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     1/2           cup  raisins -- soaked in warm
                        water to rehydrate then drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  4             pounds  veal breast
                        = (alternatively may use beef top round)
  4                     hard boiled eggs -- shelled, quartered
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  1                cup  red wine -- for braising
                        Tomato sauce -- for braising

Prepare the bread stuffing by soaking the bread in milk for 5 minutes.  Squeeze out the excess milk with your hands then put the bread in a clean mixing bowl.  Add parsley, cheese, garlic, copacola, pine nuts, and raisins.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Drizzle with olive oil to moisten and mix thoroughly.

Set the veal on a piece of plastic wrap.  Make a deep slice along the veal breast and fan open like a book.  Lay another piece of plastic wrap on top.  Using the smooth side of a mallet, gently flatten the veal until it's about 1/2-inch thick; take care not to tear.  Discard the top sheet of plastic wrap; rub the surface with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Spread the stuffing evenly over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border all around.  Place the eggs lengthwise down the center of the meat and roll up like a jellyroll log, using the plastic wrap as support.  Tie the roll with kitchen string to secure.

Heat olive oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or roasting pan.  Brown the stuffed veal roast well on all sides.  Cover with foil and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 1 hour.

Alternatively, deglaze with red wine, then pour tomato sauce on top to cover the braciole.  Cover the pan and gently simmer for about 1 hour until tender.

To serve, remove the strings from the veal bundle and cut into 1-inch slices.  Arrange on a serving platter, with or without sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  butternut squash - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
  6                     fresh sage leaves -- cut thin strips
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano
                        Chopped chestnuts -- for garnish

Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise to remove the seeds and strings.  Peel the skin using a paring knife and cut the squash into small cubes.

Place the olive oil and shallots in a deep skillet over medium heat.  When the shallots begin to color, add the squash and season with salt and pepper.  Saute a few minutes to lightly caramelize the surface of the cubes.  Add the bay leaf, nutmeg, sage, and chicken broth.  Cover the pan and cook until the squash is tender but still holding its shape, about 8 minutes.

Puree the sauce with a standard or immersion blender and serve with Perfect Potato Gnocchi (see recipe).  Top with grated cheese and chopped chestnuts before serving.  If desired, fry some sage and shallots in olive oil to garnish.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf Italian bread
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced, plus
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     anchovy fillets
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2                     romaine lettuce hearts -- cut 2" pieces
  2            bunches  watercress -- trimmed
  1                     hard boiled egg
  1                cup  shredded Pecorino Romano
     1/2           cup  chopped parsley
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  1              pound  cooked grilled chicken -- sliced in strips

Remove the crust from the Italian bread then cut the loaf into cubes.  Place the bread cubes in a mixing bowl.

In a small pan over medium heat, add the oil, minced garlic, and oregano.  Cook for 2 minutes to infuse the flavors.  Pour the oil over the bread cubes and toss.  Season with salt and pepper.

Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a baking pan and bake for 10 minutes in a preheated 400 degree oven.  The croutons should be crisp but not too hard to pierce with a fork.

In a mini food processor, combine remaining garlic, anchovy, mustard, lemon, vinegar, Worcestershire, salt and pepper.  Process for 30 seconds to make a paste.  Add the olive oil and process again until combined.

Combine the romaine and watercress in a large salad bowl.  Grate the hard boiled egg into the bowl.  Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat the leaves.  Add the cheese, croutons, parsley and chicken, toss well.  Season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Caprese Salad With Homemade Mozzarella

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            gallons  water -- divided
  2             pounds  whole milk mozzarella curd
                        = (available at specialty Italian markets)
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt -- divided, plus
                        more for serving
                        Roma tomatoes -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        Fresh basil -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large pot, heat a gallon of water to a simmer.  In a large bowl, break up the mozzarella curd into small pieces.  Coat the curd with 1 tablespoon salt, and set aside.  In another large bowl, add remaining salt to the second gallon of water along with as much ice as it can hold.

This is where it gets a little tricky.  Carefully pour the hot water over the salted curd.  As the curds begin to melt, carefully stir with a wooden spoon or spatula for 1 minute.  Submerge both of your hands in the ice water for as long as you can stand it, because you're about to stretch the mozzarella in hot water.  To protect your hands, you may wear rubber gloves if desired.

The curd will have settled into the bottom of the bowl, and at this point you have to work quickly or risk over-cooking the curd and it becoming rubbery.  Dip your hands into the hot water and begin stretching the mozzarella.  By stretching the cheese, you insure that all the curds have completely melted.  Form the mozzarella into tomato size balls, and then drop the mozzarella into the ice water to set.

Slice the mozzarella in 1/4-inch slices.  On a serving platter, arrange mozzarella and tomato slices, alternating and overlapping a bit.  Top with basil.  Drizzle with olive oil; season salt and pepper.

Wrap remaining mozzarella balls tightly in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to a week.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  4                     catfish fillets - (6 oz ea)
  4                     baby red potatoes -- sliced thin circles
  2                     Roma tomatoes -- cut in half
  16                    basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4          teaspoons  butter
  2                     lemons -- sliced in circles
  1                can  artichoke hearts in water - (4 oz) -- drained, quartered
     1/4           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted
                        = (or other black olives)
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper into 1-foot squares and place on a flat surface (may use aluminum foil if desired).  In the center of each piece, lay down a piece of catfish.  Divide the remaining ingredients among the servings.  Fold in the edges of the parchment paper and seal tightly to form a bundle.

Rub the top of the parchment with a little olive oil to prevent the paper from scorching in the oven.  Place packages on baking sheet and bake until the packages puff and fish is opaque, about 15 minutes.  The potatoes and tomatoes should be very soft.

Transfer packages to plates.  Allow each guest to open his or her own package at the table.  Serve with lemon wedges.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     carrots -- cut large chunks
  2                     celery stalks -- cut large chunks
  1                     onion -- halved
  1                     garlic bulb -- halved
                        Reserved chicken bones
  2             quarts  cold water
  4             sprigs  fresh parsley
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
  2               cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs
     3/4           cup  buttermilk - (to 1)
                        === SUPREME SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  oil
  1         tablespoon  flour
     1/2           cup  diced carrot
     1/2           cup  diced celery
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  flour
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- for garnish
                        Chopped flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the chicken and discard.  Rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out.  Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.  Season the body and cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper.

In a small bowl, mash together the butter, lemon juice, and chopped herbs.  Rub the herbed butter all over the chicken, as well as under the skin.  Put the lemon halves, onion, garlic, and whole herbs inside the chicken cavity, for added flavor.  Tie the legs together with kitchen twine.  Place the chicken, breast-side up, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack.  Roast for 1 hour until the meat is no longer pink.  When cool enough to handle, shred the meat, discarding the skin and set aside.  Reserve the bones for chicken stock.

Chicken Stock:  To prepare the stock, coat a large stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Add the vegetables and saute for 3 minutes.  Add the reserved chicken bones, water, and herbs; simmer for 1 hour.  Strain the stock to remove the solids and set aside.

Dumplings:  To prepare the dumplings: sift dry ingredients together in a large bowl.  In a small bowl, lightly beat the eggs and milk together; pour the liquid in the dry ingredients and gently fold.  Mix just until the dough comes together, the batter should be thick and cake-like.

To prepare Supreme Sauce:  In a Dutch oven, melt butter and heat oil over medium heat.  Add carrot, celery, garlic, and bay leaves.  Saute until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour to make a roux.  Continue to stir and cook for 2 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste.  Slowly pour in the chicken stock, 1 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.

Let sauce simmer until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes.  Stir in heavy cream.

Fold the reserved shredded chicken into the sauce and bring up to a simmer.  Using 2 spoons, carefully drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the hot mixture.  The dumplings should cover the top of the sauce, but should not be touching or crowded.  Let the dumplings poach for 10 to 15 minutes until they are firm and puffy.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Chicken Cordon Bleu

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     double chicken breasts - (abt 7 oz ea) -- skinned and boned
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     thin slices deli ham
  16                    thin slices Gruyere or Swiss cheese
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
     1/4           cup  flour
  1                cup  panko bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Lay the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  Using the flat side of a meat mallet, gently pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness.  Take care not to pound too hard because the meat may tear or create holes.  Lay 2 slices of cheese on each breast, followed by 2 slices of ham, and 2 more of cheese; leaving a 1/2-inch margin on all sides to help seal the roll.  Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll up tight like a jellyroll.  Squeeze the log gently to seal.

Season the flour with salt and pepper; spread out on waxed paper or in a flat dish.  Mix the breadcrumbs with thyme, kosher salt, pepper, and oil.  The oil will help the crust brown.  Beat together the eggs and water, the mixture should be fluid.

Lightly dust the chicken with flour, then dip in the egg mixture.  Gently coat in the bread crumbs.  Carefully transfer the roulades to a baking pan and bake for 20 minutes until browned and cooked through.  Cut into pinwheels before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2    tablespoon  grated ginger
  2               cups  shredded Napa cabbage
  1                     carrot -- grated
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
  2             ounces  bean thread noodles -- blanched, chopped
  8             ounces  shredded cooked chicken breast
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped coriander
  1            package  spring roll wrappers
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Add the noodles and chicken; continue to cook until heated through.  Stir in the hoisin and oyster sauces, toss to coat the mixture.  The filling should be moist but not wet.  Remove from heat, and allow to cool.  Toss in the chopped coriander.

Lay a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface on an angle so it looks like a diamond.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper and fold up to enclose the filling.  Fold in the 2 sides.  Paint the top seam of the wrapper with beaten egg.  Continue rolling up to form a tight cylinder.

Pour about 1-inch of oil in a skillet and heat to 350 degrees.  Fry the spring rolls for 2 minutes, turning to cook all sides.  Drain on paper towels before serving.

This recipe yields 10 spring rolls, 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PICADILLO ===
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1              pound  ground beef
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  fresh Mexican oregano leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  tomato paste - (to 1)
  2                     chipotles in adobo sauce
  3        tablespoons  golden raisins - (to 6)
  3        tablespoons  slivered almonds -- toasted
     1/2           cup  pimento-stuffed green olives -- sliced
     1/2           cup  crumbled queso blanco - (to 1)
                        === CHILES RELLENOS ===
  8              large  poblanos
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Flour -- for dredging
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     eggs -- separated
                        Tomato Ranchero Sauce -- (see recipe)

To prepare Picadillo:  In a large skillet, saute the onion, garlic and bay leaves in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onion is softened.  Add the beef, and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink; breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in oregano, cloves, and cinnamon.

Pour out any excess fat and stir in the tomato paste until thoroughly incorporated.  Add chipotles, raisins, almonds, and olives; salt to taste.  Remove from heat.  When mixture is cool, add cheese and mix well.

Char the flesh of the peppers over a gas flame, under a broiler or on a grill.  Alternatively, set a rack over an electric burner or use a very hot heavy frying pan.  Cook, turning frequently, until the skins are blistered all over.  Take care not to overcook and burn right through the pepper.

Put peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sweat for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins.  Rub off as much skin as possible and cut a slit along the side of each pepper, keeping the stems and tip intact.  Carefully remove the seeds and inner membranes, but do not rinse with water.

Heat 1-inch of oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat until very hot.  Place flour in a shallow platter and season with salt and pepper.  Beat egg whites until foamy, add a pinch of salt, and whip to stiff peaks.  Lightly beat the egg yolks and fold into the whites.

Stuff the chiles with picadillo, leaving enough room to close the opening.  Overlap the seam slightly and gently squeeze closed.  Secure with wooden toothpicks if desired.  Pat the peppers dry and lightly coat in the seasoned flour.

Pick the chile up by its stem and dip into the egg batter, making sure they are well covered, tap off excess.  Fry until evenly browned, about 3 minutes each side.  The egg burns easily so take care not to cook too long.  Drain on paper towels.

To serve, ladle a pool of Tomato Ranchero sauce on plates and set chiles rellenos on top, serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  cake flour - (1 lb)
  3          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2                     eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  milk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Fat for frying -- such as canola oil
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  unsalted butter
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the eggs until foamy, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until thick and yellow.

Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat and combine with milk and vanilla extract.  Stir the milk mixture into the egg mixture until blended.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix just until incorporated.  Chill for 30 minutes to make it easier to roll and cut.

Roll or pat the dough out on a heavily floured surface to about 1/4-inch thick, the dough is somewhat wet.  Cut with a floured doughnut cutter, saving the holes.  Transfer to a sheet of waxed paper and allow to air dry for 10 minutes.  The dough will form a slight crust and absorb less fat when fried.

Heat 3-inches of vegetable oil or shortening to 375 degrees in an electric fryer or deep saucepan.  Fry doughnuts until golden, about 5 minutes each side.  To keep the oil temperature constant, fry 3 at a time.  Fry the holes separately and drain on paper towels.

For the Chocolate Glaze:  Melt butter and chocolate in a saucepan until melted, remove from heat.  Whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth.  Gradually stir in the water until the mixture reaches the desired consistency.  Dip the tops of the doughnuts in the glaze.

This recipe yields 6 doughnuts.

Variation:  For chocolate donuts, melt 3 ounces of unsweetened chocolate along with the butter and continue as directed.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the eggs until foamy, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until thick and yellow.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat and combine with milk and vanilla extract.  Stir the milk mixture into the egg mixture until blended.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix just until incorporated.  Chill for 30 minutes to make it easier to roll and cut.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll or pat the dough out on a heavily floured surface to about 1/4-inch thick, the dough is somewhat wet.  Cut with a floured doughnut cutter, saving the holes.  Transfer to a sheet of waxed paper and allow to air dry for 10 minutes.  The dough will form a slight crust and absorb less fat when fried.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 3-inches of vegetable oil or shortening to 375 degrees in an electric fryer or deep saucepan.  Fry doughnuts until golden, about 5 minutes each side.  To keep the oil temperature constant, fry 3 at a time.  Fry the holes separately and drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Chocolate Glaze:  Melt butter and chocolate in a saucepan until melted, remove from heat.  Whisk in confectioners&apos; sugar until smooth.  Gradually stir in the water until the mixture reaches the desired consistency.  Dip the tops of the doughnuts in the glaze.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 doughnuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  For chocolate donuts, melt 3 ounces of unsweetened chocolate along with the butter and continue as directed.

                   Country Meat Loaf With Tomato Relish

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATO RELISH ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     onion -- diced
  2                     red bell peppers -- seeded, chopped
  2                     tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  12            ounces  bottled ketchup
                        === MEATLOAF ===
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
  3                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the tomato relish, coat a skillet with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Saute the garlic, bay leaves, and onion together until they caramelize.  Add the red peppers and cook until soft.  Add the tomatoes, parsley and Worcestershire sauce, cook for 10 minutes until the vegetables cook down.  Stir in the ketchup and continue to cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and pork together with your hands.  Fold in 1/2 cup of the tomato relish.  Add the eggs and thyme and mix with both hands just until blended.  Do not over mix or the meat loaf will become dense and tough.  Season with salt and pepper.

Coat a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.  Fill the loaf pan with the meat mixture, mounding it a bit on top.  Generously spoon some tomato relish on the surface.  When cooked, this will form a top crust.  Place the loaf pan on a cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the meat loaf has pulled away from the sides of the pan.

Remove from pan, allow to cool slightly before cutting into slices.  Serve with remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  Dungeness crabmeat -- cooked
  5             ounces  fresh sourdough bread crumbs
  1                     egg white
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
     1/2    tablespoon  sambal
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              bunch  arugula -- washed, trimmed
                        === BROWN BUTTER-TOMATO VINAIGRETTE ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1                     shallot -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
  4                     tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                     orange -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  sherry
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a mixing bowl, combine the crab meat with the bread crumbs.  Add the egg white, mayonnaise, sambal, chives, and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper.  Fold the ingredients gently but thoroughly, taking care not to mash the crabmeat.  Shape the mixture into 4 uniform patties; they should be moist and just hold together.

Coat a skillet with vegetable oil and place over medium heat.  Fry the crab cakes until browned, about 4 minutes each side.  Serve immediately on a bed of arugula with Brown Butter-Tomato Vinaigrette.

Brown Butter-Tomato Vinaigrette:  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat.  When foam subsides, add the shallot and bay leaves.  Cook for 1 minute to soften the shallots.  Add the remaining butter and continue to cook until the butter begins to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, orange juice, chives, and sherry.  Cook for 2 more minutes just to break down the tomatoes.  Whisk in the olive oil, season with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and serve warm with Crab Cakes.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     oranges -- juiced and zested
  2          teaspoons  cumin seed -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove the backbone and split the chicken in half.  Mix together 1/2-cup olive oil, orange juice and zest, cumin, curry, brown sugar, garlic and parsley.  Marinate the chicken in the mixture for 1 hour, covered in the refrigerator.

Place an ovenproof skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes.  Put the remaining 1/4-cup olive oil into the hot skillet and wait 1 minute for it to heat up.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, season all over with salt and pepper.  Place the chicken halves in the skillet, skin-side down.  Wrap 2 bricks in aluminum foil and set them on top of the chicken.  The weight will flatten the chicken resulting in a very crispy skin.

Cook on the stovetop for 10 minutes, then transfer the weighted skillet to a preheated 450 degree oven.  Roast for 15 to 20 minutes.  Use a thin metal spatula to pry the chicken from the pan so not to tear the skin.

This recipe yields 3 servings.

           Death-Defying Stuffed Shrimp With Tasso Ham And Crab

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely diced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley -- divided
     1/2           cup  tasso -- finely diced
  1                cup  cornbread crumbs
     1/2           cup  chicken stock - (to 3/4)
  1              pound  lump crab meat -- picked through
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  large shrimp - (abt 10 per lb) -- peeled, tails on
                        Melted butter -- as needed
  10            ounces  mixed micro greens
                        === ROASTED TOMATO AIOLI ===
  2                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1               dash  cayenne
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  4                     roasted garlic cloves
  1              pinch  saffron -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  hot water
  3                     Roma tomatoes -- split and oven dried
  1                cup  canola oil

Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Saute the onion, tasso ham and 2 tablespoons parsley for 3 to 5 minutes until fragrant.  Combine cornbread crumbs with the sauteed ham mixture in a large bowl.  Add chicken stock and blend to evenly moisten.  Gently fold in crab meat and remaining parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butterfly the shrimp by cutting almost all the way through the inside curl of the body.  Open flat to resemble a butterfly shape and devein.  Spoon 2 tablespoons into the cavity of the shrimp, fold the tail over to hold the stuffing in place.  Perch the shrimps on a lightly buttered baking dish, tail side up.  Drizzle with some melted butter and bake 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve on bed of greens with Roasted Tomato Aioli.

Roasted Tomato Aioli:  Begin with all ingredients at room temperature, they will emulsify more readily.  In a food processor or blender, process the yolks, salt, mustard, cayenne, lemon juice, garlic and saffron water.  Add the tomatoes and process again.  With the motor running, add a few drops of the oil, the mixture will begin to thicken.  Then, begin adding the remaining oil in a thin, steady stream.  Scrape down the sides of the processor/blender.  Check and adjust seasonings.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning....  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell"

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  frying chicken -- cut 8 serving pieces
  2               cups  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  red pepper sauce
  3               cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        Fresh cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
  4               cups  peanut oil -- for frying

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.  In a shallow platter, combine the buttermilk, water, and red pepper sauce.  Soak the chicken pieces, turn to coat, then cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  If time allows, marinate the chicken for up to 24 hours because the buttermilk promotes tenderness.

Place flour in a shallow platter. Season it by mixing in salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, paprika, and cayenne.  Roll the marinated chicken pieces in the flour, a few at a time, until well coated.   Then, dip chicken in the buttermilk bath again followed by another coat of seasoned flour. Allow the chicken to sit in the flour and dry out while preparing the oil, this will help the coating stay on better.  The buttermilk will keep absorbing the seasoned flour, which then fries up to form a crunchy crust.

Heat oil in a large electric skillet to 350 degrees.  There should be about 1-inch of fat in the pan.  Carefully add the chicken pieces in a single layer, skin-side down.  Do not crowd the pan or the temperature will plummet; make sure the fat continues to bubble around the chicken.  Fry for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces over and fry the other side 5 minutes.  Turn again, frying a total of 15 minutes.  The turning will produce a golden-crisp skin with even color.

Remove chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Do not put hot chicken directly in a bowl or container, the air can not circulate and the steam will cause the crust to fall off.  Serve immediately or cool to room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             pounds  boneless pork loin
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Fresh herbs
                        = (such as parsley, sage, rosemary and
                        thyme)

In a saucepan, combine apricots, figs and raisins over medium heat.  Add apple juice and chicken broth.  Add sage, butter, ginger, garlic, and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook until the fruits are reconstituted and the liquid is reduced by half, about 25 minutes.  Transfer the fruit mixture to a blender or food processor and puree until thick and smooth.

Carve a tunnel through the center of the loin with a sharpening steel or wooden dowel.  Widen the tunnel using your fingers.  Inject the sauce into the opening using a pastry bag fitted with a metal tip.  The filling should go all the way through the loin.

Rub the pork all over with oil, herbs, salt and pepper.  Sear the pork on a hot grill on all sides then transfer to a large baking pan.  Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven.  Roast until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 160 degrees, about 35 to 45 minutes.

Transfer pork roast to a cutting board; let stand 10 minutes before carving into pinwheels.  Serve with pan juices.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPE BATTER ===
  1                cup  flour
  1              pinch  salt
                        Freshly- cracked white pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
  1                cup  milk
  1                     scallion, white and green parts -- finely chopped
                        === CONFIT ===
  4                     duck legs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4                     garlic cloves
  2               cups  vegetable oil
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     carrot -- julienned
  1                     scallion, white and green parts -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh grated ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  white sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  chile paste
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Egg wash

To prepare the pancakes:  In a bowl or blender, combine flour, salt, eggs, and sesame seeds.  Gradually whisk in the milk, the batter should be lump free and the consistency of heavy cream.  Add a little water to thin out if necessary.  Fold in chopped scallions.

Coat a 6- or 8-inch skillet with peanut oil or non-stick spray and place over medium heat.  Ladle about 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan and swirl around so it covers the bottom; pour back any excess.  The batter will dry before your eyes.  Cook for 1 minute until lightly golden but not crisp, then flip over.  Remove the pancake to a platter and repeat until all the batter is used.

To prepare the Confit:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Arrange the duck legs in a single layer in a high-sided baking pan.  Season the duck heavily with salt and pepper, toss in thyme and garlic.  Pour oil over the duck and bake for 2 to 3 hours.  Remove the duck from the fat, shred the meat from the bones and set in a bowl.

To prepare the Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine the shredded duck meat with carrot, scallion, thyme, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chile paste and sesame oil; season with salt and pepper.  Lay a small amount of the filling in the scallion pancake and roll up.  Arrange them on a baking sheet, brush with egg wash, and bake for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  rapid-rising dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  flour - (to 4)
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  10                    Kalamata olives -- pitted, quartered
     1/4           cup  shredded Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, proof the yeast by combining it with the warm water and sugar.  Stir gently to dissolve.  Let stand 3 minutes until foam appears.  Turn mixer on low and slowly add the flour to the bowl.  Dissolve salt in 2 tablespoons of water and add it to the mixture.  Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium.  Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Mix until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface and fold over itself a few times.  Form the dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil so it doesn't form a skin.  Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise over a gas pilot light on the stovetop or other warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Coat a sheet pan with a little olive oil and corn meal.  Once the dough is doubled and domed, turn it out onto the counter.  Roll and stretch the dough out to an oblong shape about 1/2-inch thick.  Lay the flattened dough on the pan and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rest for 15 minutes.

In the meantime, coat a small saute pan with olive oil, add the onion, and cook over low heat for 15 minutes until the onions caramelize.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Uncover the dough and dimple with your fingertips.  Brush the surface with more olive oil and then add caramelized onions, garlic, olives, cheese, salt, pepper, and rosemary.  Bake on the bottom rack for 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Coat a sheet pan with a little olive oil and corn meal.  Once the dough is doubled and domed, turn it out onto the counter.  Roll and stretch the dough out to an oblong shape about 1/2-inch thick.  Lay the flattened dough on the pan and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rest for 15 minutes.

In the meantime, coat a small saute pan with olive oil, add the onion, and cook over low heat for 15 minutes until the onions caramelize.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Uncover the dough and dimple with your fingertips.  Brush the surface with more olive oil and then add caramelized onions, garlic, olives, cheese, salt, pepper, and rosemary.  Bake on the bottom rack for 15 to 20 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA DOUGH ===
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3                     eggs -- plus
  2                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting
                        === ALFREDO SAUCE ===
  1               pint  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

To make Pasta Dough:  Combine the flour and salt; shape into a mound on your work surface and make a well in the center.  Add whole eggs, yolks, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork.  Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion.  Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall.  Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball.

Knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes.  Brush the surface with remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Divide the ball of dough in small sections, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out.  Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting.  Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers.  Reduce the setting and crank dough through again, 2 or 3 times.  Continue tightening and rolling until the sheet is about 1/4-inch thick.  Keep in mind, overly thick pasta tastes gummy.  Cut the long sheet into workable 18-inch pieces.

Now, using the fettuccine cutting attachment, run the sheets through the cutting slot.  Dust the noodles and a baking sheet with cornmeal.  Coil the strands into a nest.  Allow to dry for about 10 minutes before cooking.

To prepare Alfredo Sauce:  Heat heavy cream over low-medium heat in a deep saute pan.  Add butter and whisk gently to melt.  Sprinkle in cheese and stir to incorporate.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper.

In a large stockpot, cook pasta in plenty of boiling salted water for 3 minutes.  Quickly drain the pasta and add it to the saute pan, gently toss the noodles to coat in the alfredo.  Transfer pasta to a warm serving bowl.  Top with more grated cheese and chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  semisweet baking chocolate -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  3                     eggs -- separated
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- cold
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Whipped cream -- for garnish
                        Chocolate shavings -- for garnish

Place the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and place over a saucepan containing barely simmering water (or use a double boiler).  Melt the chocolate and butter together and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth.  Remove from heat and cool slightly.  Add the egg yolks to the chocolate, 1 by 1, beating with a whisk until incorporated.  Set aside.

In another bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat.  Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.

Beat heavy cream in a chilled bowl until it begins to foam and thicken up.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and vanilla.  Continue to whip the cream until it holds soft peaks.

Gradually and gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Then, delicately fold in the whipped cream.  Take care not over work the mousse.  Divide mousse into 4 individual glasses.  Cover and chill for several hours.  Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate shavings before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning -- Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  capon chicken - (abt 8 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- softened
  2                     lemons -- cut in half, plus
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  fresh chopped herbs
                        = (such as tarragon, thyme or savory)
  1                     onion -- cut in half
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
                        Fresh whole herbs
                        = (such as tarragon leaves, thyme and
                        savory sprigs)
  2               cups  water
     1/4           cup  sherry

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity and rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out.  Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.  Season the body and cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, mix together the butter, lemon juice and chopped herbs.  Rub the herbed butter all over the chicken.  Put the lemon halves, onion, garlic and whole herbs inside the bird.  Tie the legs together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape.

Place the chicken, breast-side down, on a V-rack in a roasting pan.  Cooking the chicken on a rack helps make its skin crisp and keeps it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Pour water in the roasting pan to prevent the fat drippings from burning and smoking.

Roast the chicken for about 20 minutes, then carefully turn the bird over breast-side up.  It is best to take the pan out of the oven, close the oven door to maintain the temperature, and rotate the chicken on the counter.  Baste the chicken all over with the pan drippings.  Turn the heat down to 375 degrees and return the pan to the oven.  Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees to 170 degrees, count on this taking about 2 hours.  Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 15 minutes so the juices settle back into the meat before carving.

Meanwhile, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a gravy separator or measuring cup to let the fat rise to the top.  Skim and discard the fat then return the pan juices back in the roasting pan.  Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over medium heat.  Add the sherry and deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Season with salt and pepper, and serve with chicken.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity and rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out.  Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.  Season the body and cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, mix together the butter, lemon juice and chopped herbs.  Rub the herbed butter all over the chicken.  Put the lemon halves, onion, garlic and whole herbs inside the bird.  Tie the legs together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chicken, breast-side down, on a V-rack in a roasting pan.  Cooking the chicken on a rack helps make its skin crisp and keeps it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Pour water in the roasting pan to prevent the fat drippings from burning and smoking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the chicken for about 20 minutes, then carefully turn the bird over breast-side up.  It is best to take the pan out of the oven, close the oven door to maintain the temperature, and rotate the chicken on the counter.  Baste the chicken all over with the pan drippings.  Turn the heat down to 375 degrees and return the pan to the oven.  Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees to 170 degrees, count on this taking about 2 hours.  Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 15 minutes so the juices settle back into the meat before carving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a gravy separator or measuring cup to let the fat rise to the top.  Skim and discard the fat then return the pan juices back in the roasting pan.  Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over medium heat.  Add the sherry and deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Season with salt and pepper, and serve with chicken.

                           Good-Fortune Cookies

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     egg whites
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  melted butter -- cooled
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon extract
  6                     fortune strips - (2 1/2" by 1/2")

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a cookie sheet thoroughly.  Whip the egg whites on low speed until light and foamy.  Blend in the sugar and continue to beat until soft peaks form.

Pour in the melted butter, flour, salt, and extracts; mix until well combined.  Drop a tablespoon of the batter onto the prepared cookie sheet.  Using the back of a spoon, spread the batter evenly into very thin 3-inch rounds.  Alternatively, use the lid of a jar with a 3-inch circle punched out as a template, pour the batter in the ring, and remove.  Because you must work quickly to shape these cookies, bake just 3 at a time.

Bake for about 5 to 8 minutes or until the edges are a light golden color.  Remove the cookies with a spatula and place on a work surface.  Lay a fortune in the lower middle of the cookie, and fold in half to make a semi-circle.  Bend the edges up toward each other to make a crescent.  Drag the crease across the rim of a small measuring cup, with the ends facing down.  Cool in mini muffin tins to hold shape until crisp.  Repeat with remaining batter.

This recipe yields 6 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh green beans
  2               cups  pearl onions
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  3               cups  assorted wild mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (such as oyster, cremini and shiitake)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  flour
  3               cups  milk

Remove the vegetables from the boiling water with a strainer then plunge into an ice bath to stop the cooking process.  Drain them, then remove the skins from the onions and set aside.

Coat a skillet with olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Sweat the garlic and shallot down until they caramelize.  Add the bay leaves then the assorted mushrooms.  Stir to combine, season with salt, pepper and thyme.  Sprinkle the mixture with flour to tighten up.  Add the milk and boil for 3 minutes to thicken.

Place the green beans and pearl onions in a 2-quart casserole dish.  Pour the "mushroom soup" over the vegetables.  Toss to make sure the vegetables are well coated.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Top with fried onions and continue to bake for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  New York strip steak
  2                     peaches -- halved, pitted
  4               cups  mesclun greens
                        = (avoid radicchio)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  3        tablespoons  chiffonade basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped tarragon
                        === ROSEMARY INFUSED OLIVE OIL ===
  2 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  3                     fresh rosemary sprigs
                        === CREAMY BLUE CHEESE DRESSING ===
     1/2         pound  crumbled blue cheese -- plus
     1/4         pound  crumbled blue cheese -- for garnish
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced chives

Pat-dry the steak, season with salt and pepper, and place in a shallow glass pan.  Pour 2 cups rosemary oil over steak, cover, and refrigerate for several hours.  Turn the steak occasionally to coat both sides.

Allow steak to come back to room temperature before grilling.  Reserve 1/4 cup oil.  Place a ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat until very hot.  Season the steak again and grill steak about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove steak to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes before cutting in slices.

Brush the flesh of the peaches with remaining rosemary oil.  Place cut side face down on the hot grill pan for 3 minutes.  Turn over and grill the other side just for 1 minute to soften.  Remove and slice peaches into wedges.

Toss the greens and herbs together and divide among plates.  Fan the steak slices and peach wedges on top.  Drizzle the dressing over steak and peach salad, garnish with remaining 1/4 pound crumbled blue cheese.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper and serve.

To prepare the Rosemary Infused Olive Oil:  Warm oil and rosemary over low heat in a small saucepan.  Allow to steep for 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.

To prepare the Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing:  Whisk together 1/2 pound blue cheese with sour cream, lemon, vinegar and cayenne until smooth.  Fold in chives, cover, and chill until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Pat-dry the steak, season with salt and pepper, and place in a shallow glass pan.  Pour 2 cups rosemary oil over steak, cover, and refrigerate for several hours.  Turn the steak occasionally to coat both sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Allow steak to come back to room temperature before grilling.  Reserve 1/4 cup oil.  Place a ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat until very hot.  Season the steak again and grill steak about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove steak to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes before cutting in slices.

Brush the flesh of the peaches with remaining rosemary oil.  Place cut side face down on the hot grill pan for 3 minutes.  Turn over and grill the other side just for 1 minute to soften.  Remove and slice peaches into wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss the greens and herbs together and divide among plates.  Fan the steak slices and peach wedges on top.  Drizzle the dressing over steak and peach salad, garnish with remaining 1/4 pound crumbled blue cheese.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the Rosemary Infused Olive Oil:  Warm oil and rosemary over low heat in a small saucepan.  Allow to steep for 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing:  Whisk together 1/2 pound blue cheese with sour cream, lemon, vinegar and cayenne until smooth.  Fold in chives, cover, and chill until ready to serve.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless pork rump roasts - (abt 3 lbs ea)
  3        tablespoons  Hawaiian or coarse salt
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  prepared guava jam
  2        tablespoons  Macadamia nut oil
  1           teaspoon  water -- plus
     1/2           cup  water
  10                    banana leaves -- wet
  1              stalk  sugar cane -- halved lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  all-natural liquid smoke flavoring

Season the pork roasts all over with salt and pepper.  Prepare an outdoor barbecue by soaking mesquite wood chips in water and adding to the coals for added flavor.  Sear the pork on the hot grill to lock in the natural juices.

Whisk together guava jam, oil, and 1 teaspoon of water.  Season with fresh cracked pepper.  Rub the pork with guava paste.

Set 2 wide pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil on a flat surface.  Lay 5 banana leaves on each piece of foil in a crisscross pattern, then place the pork roasts on top.  Fold the banana leaves up around the roasts to make a bundle.  Insert a sugar cane spear through the banana leaves and into the pork to secure.  Tent the foil over the roasts and seal 3 of the sides to form a pouch.

Mix liquid smoke and remaining water together in a small bowl, pour it into the pouch.  Close up the remaining edge of foil to lock in the moisture and flavor.  Transfer back to the hot grill.  Roast for 2 1/2 to 3 hours with the grill cover down.  When the pork is cool enough to handle, shred using 2 forks.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1            package  rapid rise dry yeast
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3                     egg yolks -- slightly beaten
  3 1/2           cups  cake flour - (1 lb)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Fat for frying -- such as canola oil
  10            ounces  raspberry jam
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar

In a small saucepan, scald the milk by heating just until bubbles form around the edge of the pot; the milk should not actually boil.  Remove from heat and whisk in butter to melt, allow to cool 10 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Bloom the yeast by sprinkling it over the warm milk and butter.  Add the sugar and stir gently to dissolve.  Let stand 10 minutes until foam appears, this indicates the yeast is active.

Turn mixer on low and add the egg yolks then gradually add the flour.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and add the salt.  Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Mix just until the dough is supple and elastic, about 5 minutes.

Once smooth, turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead gently for 2 minutes.  Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat all sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  If you have time, let rise in the refrigerator for several hours because chilling will make the dough easier to roll out.

Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/2-inch thick and cut with a floured biscuit cutter or water glass, about 3-inches in diameter.  Transfer to a greased baking sheet, and allow to rise again for 30 minutes.

Heat 3-inches of vegetable oil or shortening to 375 degrees in an electric fryer or deep saucepan.  Slip doughnuts in the hot oil, top-risen side down, and fry doughnuts until golden, about 4 minutes each side.  To keep the oil temperature constant, fry 3 at a time.  Drain on paper towels.

Fit a pastry bag with a small tip and fill with jam.  Poke a small hole in the side of the doughnut and pipe the jam inside.  Dust heavily with confectioners' sugar while still slightly warm.

This recipe yields 6 doughnuts.

  1                cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/3           cup  roasted peanuts

Trim fat from the steak and cut into 1-inch cubes.  Combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine/sherry, egg white and salt in a glass bowl.  Add the beef and stir to coat.  Marinate for 1 hour, covered in the refrigerator.

Place peanut/corn oil in a wok, swirling to coat the sides, and place over high heat.  Add the chilies and cook until they begin to darken.  Add the garlic, ginger and Szechwan pepper; continue to cook to infuse the oil.  Add the scallions and bell pepper.

Remove the steak from the marinade and add it to the wok.  Stir-fry the beef for 3 minutes until brown.  Blend in soy sauce, rice wine, Chinese vinegar, sugar and chicken broth.  Dissolve the cornstarch slurry and add it to the sauce, stirring, to thicken.  Sprinkle in the peanuts and stir to coat.  Serve over rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     filet mignon steaks - (8 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     ripe tomatillos -- husked, rinsed,
                        and diced
  1             medium  jicama -- peeled, cubed
  2                     avocados -- peeled, cubed
     1/2                red onion -- sliced
  6                     red grape tomatoes -- halved
                        === CHIMICHURRI ===
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2                jalapeÒo -- minced
     1/2                lime -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped cilantro leaves
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Season filet mignon steaks generously with salt and pepper.  In a heavy, ovenproof skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Pan-sear the steaks, only on 1 side, for 2 minutes until a crust forms.  Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 minutes or until cooked medium-rare.

To prepare the salsa:  Toss together the tomatillo, jicama, avocado, red onion and grape tomatoes.  Pour half the chimichurri sauce into the salsa and toss gently to coat.  Serve the steaks, crust-side up, with salsa and remaining chimichurri.

To prepare the Chimichurri:  Combine garlic, jalapeÒo and lime in a small bowl.  Whisk in vinegar and olive oil.  Stir in parsley and cilantro.  Add salt, cover and let stand 2 hours to allow the flavors to marry.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  side of salmon -- sliced 1" thick
                        Hawaiian or kosher salt -- as needed
  5                     tomatoes -- chopped
  1                     Maui onion -- chopped
  1              bunch  green onions -- chopped
  2                     red Hawaiian chiles -- chopped
  1                     pineapple
  1                     lime -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  macadamia nut oil
                        Fresh cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1               head  butter lettuce -- leaves separated

Cure the salmon in salt by putting a layer of Hawaiian salt in the bottom of a glass dish.  Lay a salmon in it and gently press down.  Sprinkle more salt on top and rub it all over the salmon.  Top with even more salt, cover, and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours to pull out the water.  Table salt is not recommended for this process.

Rinse the salmon thoroughly in cold water to wash away a lot of the salt then blot dry.  Cut the salmon in cubes and place in a bowl and add tomatoes, Maui onion, green onion and chiles.

Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise.  Make crisscross cuts in the flesh and scoop out the inside pineapple chunks; add to the bowl.  Squeeze in the lime juice, add oil and black pepper, then toss the mixture to combine all the ingredients.  Cover and chill for 1 hour.

Scoop the mixture into the split pineapple shell and display as a decorative bowl.  To eat, spoon the salmon salad into a lettuce cup.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

              Mediterranean Swordfish Wrapped In Prosciutto

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  4             pounds  swordfish, center eye loin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  prosciutto slices
  8                     fresh thyme sprigs
  2                     oranges
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
  2                     fennel bulbs
     1/2           cup  whole Kalamata black olives -- pitted
  6                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  10                    fresh basil leaves -- cut chiffonade
  1         tablespoon  fennel seed
     1/4         pound  arugula
  6                     cherry tomatoes -- halved

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lightly oil the swordfish all over and season generously with salt and pepper.  Lay 15 pieces of prosciutto out flat on waxed paper, overlapping a bit, and place the swordfish loin on top.  Roll the prosciutto around the circumference of the fish, to wrap it.  Remove the waxed paper.  Secure the swordfish 'roast' with butcher's twine.  Thread the thyme sprigs under the pieces of string.

Coat a roasting pan with olive oil and set on 2 burners over high heat until almost smoking.  Sear the swordfish on all sides until the prosciutto begins to crisp up, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the fish is opaque and feels springy-firm when poked.

Using a paring knife, peel the oranges, removing all the white pith.  Place a mixing bowl under the orange to catch the juice and cut between the membranes to release the segments; add to the bowl.  Add the raisins to the oranges so they plump while preparing the rest of the dish.

Trim the stalks from the fennel bulbs, reserving the fronds for garnish, and remove tough outer leaves.  Cut the bulb in half lengthwise, trim the base, and cut out the core.  Slice fennel into strips as thin as possible.  Put the fennel slices in the bowl and add the olives, anchovies, vinegar, oil, basil, and fennel seeds.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper; toss gently to mix.

To serve, spoon the fennel salad down the length of a serving platter.  Remove twine from the swordfish and slice into 1 1/2-inch steaks, lay the swordfish in the center, and drizzle platter with olive oil.  Garnish with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and reserved fennel tops.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Long Island duck - (4 to 5 lbs)
  1                cup  honey
  2                cup  soy sauce
  1                cup  cold black coffee
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  lite miso
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar
  1                     orange -- halved
  1                     lemon -- halved
  1                     lime -- halved
                        === BOK CHOY ===
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  4              heads  baby bok choy -- halved lengthwise
  1                     small piece ginger
  1         tablespoon  mirin
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  lite miso
  2         tablespoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                     bag frozen pitted cherries - (12 oz) -- thawed, drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked white pepper -- to taste

Using a fork, pierce the duck skin all over to allow the flavor of the marinade to penetrate and the fat to drain.  Combine honey, soy sauce, coffee, ginger, miso and brown sugar together in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the brown sugar and miso.  Squeeze the citrus juice into the marinade then stuff the cavity of the duck with the citrus halves.  Place the duck in a 2 gallon freezer bag, then pour in the marinade.  Seal and refrigerate for 24 hours.

The next day, remove the duck from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towel.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place the duck on a rack in a roasting pan.  Fold the wing tips back and tie the legs together.  First, roast the duck for 20 minutes, the high temperature will caramelize the sugars on the outside of the duck and set a rich mahogany color.  After 20 minutes, drop the temperature down to 325 degrees and roast for 1 hour.  Duck heaven baby!

Bok Choy:  You can start the bok choy when the duck has about 10 minutes left in cooking.  Preheat a large skillet on medium-high.  Add peanut oil.

Saute cut-side down for about 1 minute until golden.  Discard the oil.  Take the back-side of a knife and give the ginger a good whack.  Bruising the ginger will release a ton of flavor.  Add the ginger to the pan with bok choy then add the mirin, soy, and chicken stock.  Stir in the miso, careful not to damage the food.

While you have the spoon in your hand, stir in the cornstarch mixture, then let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few minutes.  Finish with the fresh cherries, a pinch of salt, and fresh cracked white pepper.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Using a fork, pierce the duck skin all over to allow the flavor of the marinade to penetrate and the fat to drain.  Combine honey, soy sauce, coffee, ginger, miso and brown sugar together in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the brown sugar and miso.  Squeeze the citrus juice into the marinade then stuff the cavity of the duck with the citrus halves.  Place the duck in a 2 gallon freezer bag, then pour in the marinade.  Seal and refrigerate for 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The next day, remove the duck from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towel.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the duck on a rack in a roasting pan.  Fold the wing tips back and tie the legs together.  First, roast the duck for 20 minutes, the high temperature will caramelize the sugars on the outside of the duck and set a rich mahogany color.  After 20 minutes, drop the temperature down to 325 degrees and roast for 1 hour.  Duck heaven baby!

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached flour -- plus
                        more for rolling berries
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into chunks
     3/4           cup  buttermilk or cream
  1                     egg
  1               pint  fresh blueberries
                        === ORANGE GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  powdered sugar -- sifted
  2                     oranges -- juiced and zested

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar; mix thoroughly.  Cut in butter using 2 forks or a pastry blender.  The butter pieces should be coated with flour and resemble crumbs.

In another bowl, mix buttermilk and egg together, and then add to the flour mixture.  Mix just to incorporate, do no overwork the dough.

Roll blueberries in flour to coat, this will help prevent the fruit from sinking to the bottom of the scone when baked.  Fold the blueberries into batter, being careful not to bruise.

Drop large tablespoons of batter on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until brown.  Cool before applying orange glaze.

To prepare Orange Glaze:  Combine butter, sugar, orange zest, and juice over a double boiler.  Cook until butter and sugar are melted and mixture has thickened.  Remove from heat and beat until smooth and slightly cool.  Drizzle or brush on top of scones and let glaze get hazy and hardened.

This recipe yields 6 to 12 scones.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     tomatoes -- halved
  10                    garlic cloves
  2             slices  crusty bread
     1/2           cup  whole almonds -- with skin
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts or pine nuts
  1                     pimento or roasted red pepper
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  prawns -- shelled, tails
                        removed, heads left on

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Arrange the tomatoes, garlic, bread, and nuts on a baking sheet; roast for 10 to 15 minutes.

Transfer to a food processor and pulse to roughly break up.  Add the pimentos, vinegar, oil, and paprika.  Pulse again until well combined, add salt.  This sauce is best if allowed to rest so the flavors can meld (may be made a day in advance).

Heat oil to almost smoking in a large skillet or roasting pan.  Toss the prawns in half the romesco sauce to coat, and pan sear the shrimp quickly in the oil just until barely opaque.  Then roast for 10 to 12 minutes in a 450 degree oven.  Serve the remaining sauce on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  bread crumbs
                        = (Panko preferred)
  2                     shallots -- chopped
  2               cups  chopped fresh spinach
     1/4           cup  Pernod
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               dash  red pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  chopped chervil or parsley
  2              dozen  oysters -- on the half shell
                        Rock salt
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Melt butter in a skillet.  Saute the garlic for 2 minutes to infuse the butter.  Place the bread crumbs in a mixing bowl and add half the garlic butter, set aside.

To the remaining garlic butter in the skillet, add shallots and spinach, cook for 3 minutes until the spinach wilts.  Deglaze the pan with Pernod.  Season with salt and pepper, add a dash of red pepper sauce.  Allow the mixture to cook down for a few minutes.

Finish off the bread crumbs by mixing in olive oil, Parmesan and chervil, season with salt and pepper.

Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of the spinach mixture on each oyster followed by a spoonful of the bread crumb mixture.  Sprinkle a baking pan amply with rock salt.  Arrange the oysters in the salt to steady them.  Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes until golden.  Serve with lemon wedges and red pepper sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings as an appetizer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frying chicken -- cut in 12 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     Spanish chorizo sausages
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2                Spanish onion -- diced
  2                     ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1              pinch  sweet paprika
  2               cups  Spanish rice
                        = (short to medium grain, like Valencia)
  2          teaspoons  saffron threads
  6               cups  warm stock or water
  2                     lobster tails -- split
  1              pound  calamari (squid) -- cleaned, and
                        cut in rings
  1              pound  jumbo shrimp
  1              dozen  mussels -- cleaned
     1/2           cup  sweet peas -- frozen and thawed
                        Lemon wedges
                        Pimentos -- cut in strips

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry.  Season all over with salt, black pepper, and oregano.  Heat the oil in a paella pan or wide skillet.  Brown the chicken on all sides, when nearly cooked through, add the chorizo links and brown.

Remove the chicken and sausage from the pan.  Cut the sausages into slices and set aside.  Drain out excess oil but don't clean the pan.  Make a sofrito by sauteing the garlic, onion, and tomatoes, cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld.  Season with salt, black pepper, and paprika.

Add the rice, stirring to coat the grains.  Steep the saffron in 1/4-cup hot water for 5 minutes then stir it into the rice.

Add the stock/water and simmer for 10 minutes, gently moving the pan around so the rice cooks and absorbs evenly.  Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto.  Add the shellfish and the reserved chicken and sausage.  Simmer, without stirring, until the rice is al dente and the mussels have opened.  (Do not eat any mussels that do not.)

Scatter the peas on top and continue to cook until the liquid is absorbed.  The ideal paella has a toasted rice bottom called socarrat.  Allow to rest off the heat for 5 minutes before serving.  Garnish with lemon wedges and strips of pimento.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

                  Pan Fried Tofu With Spicy Ginger Soup

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  vegetable broth
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- cut in half
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Sambal
  1              pound  firm tofu
  1                cup  bread crumbs -- Panko preferred
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  hot paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
     1/2    tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     dried Hawaiian chile -- chopped
  1              pound  Chinese broccoli -- roughly chopped
     1/2         pound  udon noodles -- cooked
  1              bunch  green onions -- julienned
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
     1/2           cup  peanuts -- roasted and salted

To prepare the soup, in a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the vegetable broth, ginger, sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce and sambal.  Allow to simmer 15 minutes to mingle the flavors.

To prepare the tofu steaks, cut the tofu block lengthwise, then cut in half to make 4 slabs.  Lay several layers of paper towels on a cutting board then place the tofu, side by side, on top.  Cover the steaks with more paper towels and press down to drain out some of the water in the curd (making it denser and hold together better when cooked.)

Combine the bread crumbs, cayenne, paprika, salt and pepper.  Dip each piece of tofu into the beaten eggs then dredge in the seasoned bread crumbs to coat.

Heat peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry the tofu steaks 4 minutes each side.  Remove to a platter lined with fresh paper towels.

Add sesame oil to the skillet, stir-fry the ginger and garlic with the chili for 2 minutes to build a base flavor.  Add the broccoli and saute 3 minutes until it begins to soften, season with salt and pepper.

Divide the udon noodles and spicy broth among 4 bowls.  Add the broccoli then lay a piece of tofu on top.  Garnish with a sprinkle of green onions, cilantro, and peanuts before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    baby artichokes
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     shallot -- minced
     1/2                lemon -- cut thin circles
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2               cups  vegetable broth
     1/2           cup  black olives -- pitted
     1/4           cup  fresh basil chiffonade
  2                     tomatoes -- diced
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  sweet peas
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  penne pasta -- cooked
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino Romano

Rinse the artichokes in cold water.  Bend back the green petals and snap them off all the way down to the light green and yellow leaves.  Cut off the top cone of petals and the green part of the base.  Cut the artichokes in half, if the choke and thistle look spiky, remove them.  Otherwise, just put in acidulated water.

Coat a saucepan with 2 tablespoons olive oil and place over medium heat.  Blot the artichokes dry then add them to the pan.  Add the garlic, shallot, lemon slices, bay leaves and red pepper flakes.  Pour in the stock, cover, and let simmer for 8 minutes to soften the artichokes.

Remove the lid and add the olives, basil, tomatoes and butter, stir to incorporate.  Add the peas and remaining oil; season again with salt and pepper.

Cook pasta al dente and top with the baby artichoke sauce.  Sprinkle with grated cheese before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Perfect Potato Gnocchi

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1                     egg white
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Butternut Squash Sauce With Sage -- (see recipe)

Pierce the potatoes several times so that moisture can escape during baking.  Bake the potatoes in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 hour until fork tender.  Peel the potatoes while they are still hot and press them through a potato ricer.

Put the potatoes in a large bowl with salt, baking powder, and egg white.  Add the flour a little at a time and mix with your hands until the mixture forms a rough dough.  Do not over-work the dough.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface.  Gently knead the dough for 1 or 2 minutes until smooth, adding a little bit more flour, if necessary, to keep it from sticking.

Break off a piece of the dough and roll it back and forth into a rope, about the thickness of your index finger.  Cut the rope into 1-inch pieces.  Gently roll each piece down a wooden gnocchi board while pressing a small dimple with your finger.  The gnocchi should be slightly curved and marked with ridges.  This will allow the pillows to hold sauce when served.

Boil the gnocchi in batches in plenty of salted water.  The gnocchi are done about 2 minutes after they float to the surface, remove with a slotted spoon, and serve.  If not cooking immediately, place the gnocchi in a single layer on a baking pan dusted with flour.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 12 hours.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If the gnocchi start to feather and fall apart in boiling water, you need more flour.  If the gnocchi don't float after 2 minutes and are hard, you used too much flour.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2                     garlic cloves
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme -- divided
  2                     bay leaves -- divided
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             pounds  sliced mushrooms
  1                     leek -- cut in rings
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             pounds  baking potatoes -- sliced paper-thin
  3        tablespoons  chopped Italian parsley -- plus
                        extra for garnish
  3        tablespoons  chopped chives
  1                cup  grated Asiago

In a saucepan, combine milk, cream, garlic, 3 thyme sprigs and 1 bay leaf over low-medium heat.  Heat to just under a boil.  Remove from heat, cover, and let steep while preparing the rest of the dish.

Coat a skillet with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Add remaining thyme and bay leaf.  Saute the mushrooms and leeks for 5 minutes to evaporate the liquid.  Season with salt and pepper.

Butter a large casserole dish.  Arrange 1/3 of the sliced potatoes on the bottom of the pan, overlapping them slightly.  Season the potatoes with chopped parsley, chives, salt and pepper.  Top potatoes with half of the mushroom mixture.  Repeat layering 1/3 of the potatoes and remaining mushroom mixture.  Arrange remaining potatoes on top.  Press the layers down with a spatula to condense.

Remove the solids from the infused milk and pour over the potatoes.  Sprinkle the surface with cheese.  Cover the pan with foil and place in a preheated 375 degree oven.  Bake for 1 hour until the potatoes are tender.  Uncover and bake for 15 additional minutes until cheese melts and gratin is golden around the edges.  Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.  Garnish with fresh parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1            package  rapid-rising dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3               cups  flour
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  prosciutto -- chopped bite size
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped fine
  4             ounces  Brie
  10                    fresh sage leaves -- cut chiffonade
                        === CALZONES ===
                        Egg wash
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting

For Dough:  In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, bloom the yeast by combining it with warm water and sugar.  Stir gently to dissolve, then let stand 5 minutes until foam appears.  Turn mixer on low and slowly add the flour, 1 cup at a time.  Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil and add salt.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium.  Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and fold over itself a few times.  Form dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil so it doesn't form a skin.  Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.  Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it.  If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen.  When ready, knead the dough gently and divide in 4 balls.  Sprinkle the rounds lightly with flour, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes.  This will relax the dough, making it easier to stretch.

For Calzones:  Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  If you don't have a stone, simply grease a baking pan.

Roll or spread the dough discs into 10-inch circles, leave the dough slightly thick so that the filling will not ooze out.  Lay half the prosciutto, apples, Brie, and sage onto 1 side of the dough round and brush the outer edge with egg wash to help form a seal.  Fold dough over to enclose the filling and form a large turnover.  Roll up the edges with your fingers to close tightly and prevent leaking.  Cut a few slashes in the top to allow steam to escape during baking and brush with egg wash.  Repeat with remaining rounds.

Sprinkle a pizza peel (or prepared baking pan) with cornmeal and carefully transfer the calzones.  Bake directly on pizza stone for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.  Let the calzones rest 10 minutes before cutting to allow the cheese to set.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Raspberry Souffle

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
                        more for greasing
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting mold
  1               pint  pureed raspberries
  4                     eggs -- separated
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins or a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish by greasing with softened butter and coating with granulated sugar, pour out any excess.  The butter and sugar will keep the souffles from sticking to the sides and will allow them to rise evenly.  The sugar will also give the souffle a crunchy crust, which is a great contrast to the soft interior.

To make the fruit puree base, heat the raspberry puree, 3/4 cup sugar and butter in a saucepan and place over medium heat.  Cook for 10 minutes to dissolve the sugar.  Remove from heat, cool slightly, then strain to remove the raspberry seeds.  Whisk in the egg yolks 1 at a time.

In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until they hold soft peaks.  Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the raspberry mixture to lighten it.  Then gently fold in the rest.

Spoon into the prepared ramekins or souffle dish and place on a cookie sheet.  Bake on the middle rack for about 20 minutes.  The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden and the center giggles slightly.  Take care not to over bake.  Dust with powdered sugar before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Roast Leg Of Lamb

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic bulb -- roasted
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             pounds  whole leg of lamb -- bone in
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Roasted Pear Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a small bowl, mash together the roasted garlic cloves, rosemary, lemon and oil; set aside.  With a sharp knife, trim away the white skin that covers the lamb (also called fell) as well as the excess fat.  Pull up the layer of fat and fell, cutting as you go to expose the meat underneath.  Next, remove the tailbone and hipbone at the large end of the lamb.

Cut off the tailbone that protrudes out of the leg.  Then, cut under and around the hipbone, scraping the meat away to expose the leg joint.  Cut through the tendons around the joint and separate the hipbone.  Cut down the length of the leg and remove the thighbone.  The leg of lamb is now boneless.  Divide the meat into 3 large pieces, this will facilitate quicker cooking.  Score the surface of the lamb and rub it with the garlic paste.  Roll up each boneless piece of lamb and tie with heavy kitchen string or butcher's twine to hold the roasts together.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and chill overnight.

Prepare a barbecue.  Season the lamb roast generously with salt and pepper, then place on the hot grill.  Sear the outside of the meat until brown all around, but do not char.  Close the grill cover and roast for 30 minutes.  The lamb is done when it is still pink and the internal temperature reads 135 degrees.  Allow the roast to stand 10 minutes to let the juices settle before cutting off the twine and slicing.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- as needed
     3/4           cup  sweet Swedish mustard -- divided
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh dill -- divided
  4                     center-cut salmon fillets - (4 oz ea)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- melted
  3                     phyllo pastry sheets
  1         tablespoon  caraway seed -- toasted
  1                     leek, white part only -- cut in rings
  1              pound  fingerling potatoes -- roasted
  1                cup  creme fraiche -- prepared
  2        tablespoons  dried currants
  1              bunch  mesclun greens
  1              ounce  salmon roe

Mix together 2 tablespoons each olive oil, sweet mustard, and dill.  Brush the mixture on the salmon fillets; season with salt and pepper.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees, brush a baking sheet with some melted butter.

Unroll the phyllo dough and lay a sheet flat on a work surface.  Brush the sheet with melted butter, then dust with some caraway and dill.  Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, stacking on top of each other.  With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, remove 4-inches off the side of the sheets to form a square.  Now, cut criss-cross to make 4 even squares.

Transfer the squares to the baking sheet.  Lay a piece of salmon in the center of each square and fold up the corners.  As you work, keep the phyllo covered with a damp, not wet, towel to prevent drying out.  Brush the pastry lightly with butter and bake for 25 minutes or until the fish is opaque.  In the meantime prepare the potatoes.

Coat a saute pan with olive oil and cook the leeks until translucent.  Cut the roasted potatoes in half lengthwise and place face down in the pan to give them color.  Add creme fraiche, remaining mustard, dill, and currants.  Cook over low heat until heated through, about 5 minutes.

To serve:  Divide the potato mixture among 4 shallow bowls, mound a handful of greens on top followed by the salmon phyllo.  Garnish with salmon caviar and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  red snapper - (abt 4 lbs) -- cleaned
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  1                     orange -- sliced
  1              pound  fresh fennel -- chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     shallot -- minced
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  fennel seed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4                     egg whites
  1                cup  kosher salt

When cooking with a whole fish you must first be sure that the fish is gutted, your local fish market will do this for you.  The skin should be scaled and the gills and fins removed.  Leave on the head and tail.  Rinse the fish inside and out then pat dry.

In a mixing bowl, combine the parsley, orange, fennel, bay leaves, shallot, red pepper flakes, fennel seed, and 1/4 cup olive oil.  Stuff the cavity of the fish with 3/4 of the mixture, then spread the remaining 1/4 on the bottom of a roasting pan so the fish will not stick.  Transfer the fish to the roasting pan and rub the skin with remaining olive oil.

In another bowl, whip the egg whites to a stiff peak, then fold in the salt to make a paste.  Smear the salt paste over the entire fish and roast in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes.  The egg whites form a hard crust that will crack like a shell.  To serve, scoop the flesh from the fish with a spoon.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MASHED POTATOES ===
  3             pounds  Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                cup  milk -- warm
     1/2         stick  butter -- room temperature
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  boneless beef brisket or chuck steak -- cubed
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  canned low sodium beef broth
  1                can  chopped tomatoes - (8 oz)
                        Celery, carrot, 1/2 onion -- tied together with
                        string
  2               cups  frozen sweet peas -- thawed
  2               cups  frozen diced carrots -- thawed
  1                cup  pearl onions -- blanched
  3        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Mashed Potatoes:  Place the cut potatoes in a large stockpot, cover with cold water and add salt.  Bring to a boil, then simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain well in a colander.  While the potatoes are still warm, press them through a potato ricer or food mill and into a mixing bowl.  Whip in the warm milk and softened butter until incorporated and the potatoes are fluffy.  Cover and keep warm.

Filling:  In a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, add the oil then braise the beef with the garlic, onion, and bay leaves.  Season with salt and pepper.  When the meat is browned and the onion is tender, dust with flour.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often.  Pour in the beef broth and cook for 2 minutes until the mixture begins to thicken.  Add the canned tomatoes and the whole vegetables tied together.  Simmer for 5 minutes to infuse the flavors, then remove the vegetable bundle.  Add the peas, carrots, pearl onions, and parsley.  Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

Transfer the meat mixture to a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish.  Spread the mashed potatoes evenly on top of the casserole.  Dot with butter if desired.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the potatoes are golden, about 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
                        = (white and green parts)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             pounds  fresh baby spinach -- trimmed, washed,
                        and roughly chopped
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  12            ounces  crumbled feta
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- toasted, ground
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- melted
  1              pound  phyllo pastry sheets
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped oregano
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped chives
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan

Heat olive oil in a large skillet and place over medium heat.  Saute onions and garlic for 3 minutes until soft.  Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper, and continue to saute until the spinach is limp, about 2 minutes.  Add lemon juice, remove from heat and place in a colander, and squeeze out excess liquid.  Set aside to cool.  The filling needs to be cool and dry to prevent the phyllo from becoming soggy.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with feta, coriander, and nutmeg.  Season, then fold in the cooled spinach mixture until well blended.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees, brush 2 baking sheets with some melted butter.  Unroll the phyllo dough and lay a sheet flat on a work surface.  Take care to keep the phyllo covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out and becoming brittle.  Brush the sheet with melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with some oregano and chives.  Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, stacking on top of each other.  With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the sheets lengthwise into thirds to form 2 1/2-inch strips.  Do this with all the sheets of dough.

Place a heaping teaspoon of filling near 1 corner of the layered phyllo strip.  Fold the end at an angle over the filling to form a triangle.  Continue to fold the triangle along the strip until you reach the end, like folding up a flag.  Brush the top with butter and dust with Parmesan, place on prepared baking sheet, and cover while preparing the remaining pastries.  Repeat until all the filling and phyllo strips are used up.  Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the triangles are crisp and golden.  Serve hot, warm or cold.

This recipe yields approximately 40 triangles.

        Spicy Shrimp Tamales, Roasted Tomatillo Sauce, Goat Cheese

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tomatillos -- husked
  1                     white onion -- peeled
  4                     garlic cloves
  2                     Anaheim green chiles -- stems removed
  2          teaspoons  cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  cilantro
  2               cups  prepared masa
  6             ounces  goat cheese -- room temperature
  1                     bag dried cornhusks -- cleaned, soaked
  2             pounds  jumbo shrimp -- cleaned
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  coriander
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Place tomatillos, onion, garlic, and green chiles in a roasting pan and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the roasted vegetables to a food processor along with any juices that are at the bottom of the pan.  Add the cumin, salt, and cilantro.  Pulse the mixture until combined but still chunky.  You may add a bit of water or broth if the mixture is too thick.  Reserve half the sauce to serve with the tamales.

In a deep bowl, combine the masa and remaining half of the tomatillo sauce.  Beat until fully incorporated and the dough is green.  Fold in the softened goat cheese.

Set the cornhusks on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel.  Lay the husk flat on a plate with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you.  Spread a thin, even layer of the masa mixture over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon that is dipped in water.  Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling.  The sticky masa will form a seal.  Pinch the wide top closed.

Stand the tamales up in a large steamer or colander with the pinched end up.  Load the steamer into a large pot filled with 2-inches of water.  The water should not touch the tamales.  Lay a damp cloth over the tamales and cover with lid.  Keep the water at a low boil, checking periodically to make sure the water doesn't boil away.  Steam the tamales for 2 hours.

Coat the shrimp with cumin, chili powder, cayenne, coriander, salt, and pepper.  Heat oil in a saute pan, cook the shrimp for 5 minutes until pink.  To serve, unfold the tamales, top with the spicy shrimp and spoon the reserved tomatillo sauce over the top.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1            package  rapid-rising dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3               cups  flour
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  baby spinach -- washed, dried
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  15            ounces  ricotta
  1                cup  grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  shredded fontina
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        === CALZONES ===
                        Egg wash
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting

For Dough:  In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, bloom the yeast by combining it with warm water and sugar.  Stir gently to dissolve, then let stand 5 minutes until foam appears.  Turn mixer on low and slowly add the flour, 1 cup at a time.  Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil and add salt.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium.  Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and fold over itself a few times.  Form dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil so it doesn't form a skin.  Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.  Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it.  If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen.  When ready, knead the dough gently and divide in 4 balls.  Sprinkle the rounds lightly with flour, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes.  This will relax the dough, making it easier to stretch.  In the meantime prepare filling.

For Filling:  In a saute pan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add garlic and cook 2 minutes until lightly browned.  Add the spinach, season, and continue to cook until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a colander and squeeze out the excess liquid.  If necessary, drain the ricotta in a sieve to remove excess moisture also.  Calzone filling should be fairly dry, because it may leak out or make the dough mushy.  Combine spinach, cheeses, egg, and pepper in a large bowl.

For Calzones:  Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  If you don't have a stone, simply grease a baking pan.  Roll or spread the dough discs into 10-inch circles, leave the dough slightly thick so that the filling will not ooze out.  Spoon a quarter of the filling onto 1 side of the dough round and brush the outer edge with egg wash to help form a seal.  Fold dough over to enclose the filling and form a large turnover.  Roll up the edges with your fingers to close tightly and prevent leaking.  Cut a few slashes in the top to allow steam to escape during baking and brush with egg wash.  Repeat with remaining rounds.

Sprinkle a pizza peel (or prepared baking pan) with cornmeal and carefully transfer the calzones.  Bake directly on pizza stone for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.  Let the calzones rest 10 minutes before cutting to allow the cheese to set.  Serve with basic tomato sauce if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Standing Rib Roast With Cabernet Au Jus

Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     prime 3-rib beef roast* - (abt 6 lbs)
  5                     garlic cloves -- smashed
                        Fresh rosemary and thyme -- roughly chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil
  2                     carrots -- cut in chunks
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut in chunks
  1                     onion -- cut in half
  2               cups  Cabernet Sauvignon
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/4           cup  water or beef drippings
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

* Buying and trimming:  When ordering the rib roast from a butcher, be sure to request a "top choice" roast cut from the small loin end; the best being ribs 12 through 10.  Have the butcher cut off the chine/backbone.  The rib bones look best if they are shortened and frenched, have the butcher do this for you as well.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place the roast, rib-side down, in a large roasting pan.  In a small bowl mash together garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper and olive oil to make a paste.  Smear the paste generously over the entire roast.  Scatter the vegetables around the meat and drizzle with olive oil.  Roast for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or approximately 20 minutes per pound for medium-rare.  Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer, it should register 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare.

Remove the beef to a carving board and allow to rest for 20 minutes to let the juices settle.  Note: the internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise about 10 degrees.  Remove the vegetables and set aside.  Pour the pan juices into a fat separator so you can use the broth for the au jus and save the fat for Yorkshire pudding.

Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat.  Add the cabernet and scrape up the brown bits in the bottom of the pan.  Add sugar, water/beef drippings, reserved vegetables and parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Strain the sauce through a sieve to remove the solids before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 9 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  mussels
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     shallot -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- shaved
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                cup  low-sodium chicken broth
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1                     tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut in large dice
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Rinse the mussels under cold running water while scrubbing with a vegetable brush.  Discard any with broken shells.

Heat oil in a 6- to 8-quart stockpot.  Saute the shallot, garlic and thyme to create a base flavor.  Add the mussels and give them a good toss.  Add wine, lemon juice, chicken broth and red pepper flakes; cover the pot and steam over medium-high for 5 minutes until the mussels open.

Toss in the tomato, parsley and butter, recover the pot, and steam for another minute to soften.  The tomatoes should keep their shape.  Serve with plenty of grilled garlic bread to sop up the broth.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     parsley sprigs
  4                     garlic cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     lemons -- cut in half
     1/4           cup  white wine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              quart  chicken broth
                        = (or water)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              whole  artichokes

Put the parsley, garlic, bay leaves, lemons, wine, oil and broth in a large pot and bring to a simmer.  Season the liquid with salt and pepper.  In the meantime prepare the artichokes.

Wash artichokes under cold water.  Using a heavy stainless steel knife, cut off the stems close to the base.  Pull off the lower petals that are small and tough.  Cut off the top inch of the artichoke and rub with half a lemon to preserve the green color.  Alternatively, you may put the artichokes in acidulated water.  If you wish, trim the thorny tips of the petals with kitchen shears.

Place the artichokes in the steaming liquid, bottom up.  Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.  The artichokes are done when a knife is inserted into the base and there is no resistance.

To eat, pull off a leaf and scrape the meat off the tender end with your front teeth.  Dip the ends of the leaves in lemon juice and melted butter if desired.  When you reach the center cone of purple prickly leaves, remove it.  This is the choke that protects the heart.  Now, scrape away the thistle fuzz covering the artichoke heart.  The heart is the meatiest part of the artichoke.  Steamed artichokes may be served hot or cold.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ripe black plantains - (to 3)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  natural vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar

To peel the plantains, cut off ends and discard.  With a paring knife, make 3 shallow slits lengthwise along the seams of the skin and peel away.  Split the plantains lengthwise.

Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet and place over medium-low heat (plantains have a high sugar content and will burn if the heat is too high).  Fry the plantains in a single layer, until golden on the bottom then turn over with a spatula.  Add the cinnamon, vanilla, and sugar and let cook a few more seconds, just to begin caramelizing the sugar.

Just before serving, melt remaining tablespoon of butter to finish the sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Add the cinnamon, vanilla, and sugar and let cook a few more seconds, just to begin caramelizing the sugar.

Just before serving, melt remaining tablespoon of butter to finish the sauce.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  swordfish steaks, 1" thick
  24                    kaffir lime leaves -- fresh or dried
                        = (available at Asian markets and in the
                        Asian foods section of most supermarkets)
  2        tablespoons  Thai fish sauce (Nahm pla)
                        = (available at Asian markets and in the
                        Asian foods section of most supermarkets)
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  sambal
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  2                     limes -- juiced, divided
  1         tablespoon  Thai green curry paste
                        = (available at Asian markets and in the
                        Asian foods section of most supermarkets)
     1/2           cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk
                        = (available at Indian markets, Asian
                        markets, Latin American markets and
                        many supermarkets)
     1/4           cup  hand-shredded fresh mint leaves
     1/4           cup  hand-shredded fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  chopped peanuts -- divided
  1         tablespoon  black sesame seeds -- divided
  8              large  butter lettuce leaves
  2                     Thai red chilies -- diced
  2                     shallots -- cut in rings and
                        fried
  4                     wooden skewers -- soaked in water
                        for 1 hour

Cut the swordfish into 2-inch cubes and thread onto the skewers, alternating with the lime leaves.  Lay the kebobs in a shallow non-aluminum pan.

In a bowl, whisk together fish sauce, honey, sambal, oil, and the juice of 1 of the limes.  Pour the marinade over the swordfish and let marinate for 1 hour.

Heat a ridged grill pan (or barbecue) until very hot.  Remove the swordfish skewers from the marinade and grill about 4 minutes per side.  Take care not to overcook so the fish remains moist.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together curry paste, coconut milk, remaining lime juice, mint, cilantro, 2 tablespoons peanuts, and 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds.  Season with salt and pepper.

Remove the swordfish from the skewers and break up in bite-sized pieces; discard lime leaves.  Toss the swordfish in the curry mixture.  To eat, spoon the swordfish chunks into a lettuce leaf and top with remaining peanuts, sesame seeds, diced chiles and fried shallots.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried navy beans
  1              piece  salt pork
  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/2           cup  molasses
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  sliced bacon

Pick through the beans and remove any pebbles.  Place beans in a colander and rinse under cold water.  Transfer the beans to a large pot or bowl, add water to cover by 2-inches and let soak overnight.  The beans will rehydrate and swell to twice their size.

Drain and rinse the beans, then put in a saucepan.  Cover the beans with fresh water and place over medium heat.  Add the remaining ingredients, except for the bacon.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 25 minutes or until the beans are tender but not breaking apart.

Transfer the beans and broth to a 2-quart oven-safe dish.  Lay bacon slices in a single layer on top of the beans.  Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour to cook the bacon.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  light corn syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Nonstick cooking spray
  1           teaspoon  peppermint extract
  1           teaspoon  orange extract
                        Food coloring
                        Butter

In a 4-quart saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, and salt.  Swirl the pot over the burner to dissolve the sugar completely, do not stir.  Increase the heat and boil to soft-ball stage (250 degrees).  Use a candy thermometer for accuracy.  Wash down the inside wall of the pot with a wet pastry brush if necessary.  Remove from heat, stir in the butter and vanilla.

Coat 3 sheet pans with nonstick spray.  Pour the mixture onto the sheet pans, dividing in 3 equal portions.  Mix the peppermint extract and a couple of drops of green food coloring in 1 batch.  Mix the orange extract and a couple of drops of yellow food coloring in another batch.  Leave the plain vanilla batch as is.  As the candy cools, lift the edges toward the center with a metal spatula or bench scraper so they don't harden.

When just cool enough to handle, butter your hands and pull the taffy into long ropes.  Twist and pull until the taffy is stiff and the color is even.  Cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces with clean, buttered kitchen scissors.  Wrap each piece in waxed paper and store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced
  3        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  thyme leaves
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated lemon zest
  2               cups  low sodium chicken broth
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  flour
  1                     egg yolk -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  milk
  4             pounds  cooked turkey breast -- chunks or tenders
  1              pound  egg noodles -- cooked
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted

Coat a skillet with oil and put over medium heat.  Add shallot and garlic, cook, stirring, until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and herbs and saute for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the mushrooms to a glass bowl, grate in the zest of a lemon, then cover with plastic wrap to infuse the flavor.  Set aside.

Heat the chicken broth in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.  Melt butter in the skillet and stir in the flour to make a roux.  Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes.  Whisk in the warm stock and stir vigorously to avoid lumps.  Continue for 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened and smooth.  Add the egg, milk, reserved mushrooms, and turkey.  Cook and stir until heated through, do not let boil.  Fold in the cooked noodles and mix to combine.

Spoon the mixture into a buttered 9- by 13-inch baking pan and smooth out with a spoon.  Sprinkle with bread crumbs and Parmesan.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the sauce bubbles and a top crust has formed, 20 to 30 minutes.  Garnish with toasted almonds before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

          Warm Saffron Potatoes With Serrano Ham And Sweet Peas

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  good quality mayonnaise
  1              pinch  saffron threads -- steeped in
  1         tablespoon  hot water
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, cubed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- diced
  1                     red chile -- diced
  1                cup  chopped Serrano ham
  1                cup  sweet peas -- frozen and thawed
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Combine mayonnaise, saffron liquid and lemon juice thoroughly in a food processor; season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  The mayonnaise will turn a beautiful yellow color and should be somewhat thin to combine smoothly with the potato mixture.

Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until fork tender, about 30 minutes.  Drain potatoes well in a colander.  Heat oil in a skillet until almost smoking.  Saute the onion and chiles.  Add the potatoes and fry until the edges are crispy and brown.  Transfer to a mixing bowl.  Add ham, and peas and parsley; toss lightly to combine.

Gently fold the saffron mayonnaise into the potato salad, taking care not to break up the cubes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut in strips
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     portobello mushroom cap -- sliced
     1/2                red onion -- cut in rings
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3             ounces  Gorgonzola
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Trim, wash and dry the spinach thoroughly and place in a salad bowl.

Coat a saute pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil and put over medium heat.  Fry the prosciutto and garlic for a minute to flavor the oil, and then add the mushrooms and onions.  Saute the mushrooms and onions until they are slightly brown and tender, about 3 minutes.

Scrape the mixture on top of the spinach, return the pan to the stove.  Add balsamic vinegar and scrape up the bits at the bottom of the pan.  Add remaining oil and honey.  Swirl pan around for a minute to warm the vinaigrette.

Pour the vinaigrette over the salad, top with Gorgonzola.  Season with salt and pepper, toss, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Wonderful White Bread

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1            package  rapid-rising dry yeast - (1 tbspn)
  2        tablespoons  sugar or honey
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2                     egg whites -- divided, and
                        slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

In a small saucepan, heat the milk with butter over low heat just until the butter melts.  Remove from heat and add to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Proof the yeast by adding it to the warm milk and butter.  Add the sugar and stir gently to dissolve.  Let stand 3 minutes until foam appears.  This indicates the yeast is active.  Turn mixer on low and gradually add the flour.  When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and add the salt and 1 egg white.  Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook.  Mix until the dough is no longer sticky, about 10 minutes.

Turn the dough onto the work surface and knead for a minute or so by hand.  Knead by folding the dough over itself and pushing out with the heel of your hands, not down.  Rotate the dough and repeat.  The dough is properly kneaded when you can pull it and it stretches without breaking.  Form the dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil.  Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise over a gas pilot light on the stovetop or in another warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.  Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it.  If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen.

Once the dough is doubled and domed, turn it out onto the counter.  The act of turning out the dough naturally deflates the gas, so there is no need to aggressively punch it down.  Handle the dough gently, overworking the gluten at this point will produce a dense loaf that is difficult to shape.  *To form a loaf, pat the dough into a rectangle, fold the long sides to the middle then fold under the ends.  Pinch the seams closed and place in a greased 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, seam-side down.  Make sure the dough touches all sides of the pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise a second time for 20 minutes or until the top of the dough is nearly level with the top of the loaf pan.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees, place a large pan on the bottom rack of the oven.  Bring 3 cups water to a boil on the stove.  Pour the hot water into the preheated pan to create a steam bath for the bread.  This will make a crisp crust.

Slash dough down the middle of the loaf with a sharp knife to allow the steam to escape during baking.  Brush the top with remaining beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake the bread for 30 to 40 minutes until crust is golden and internal temperature reads 195 degrees when checked with an instant read thermometer.  The bottom of the loaf should sound hollow when tapped.  Immediately remove the bread from the pan and cool completely on a rack.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

* Variation:  To make Cinnamon-Raisin Swirl Bread: after the first rise, press the dough out to a rectangle, sprinkle surface with cinnamon and raisins to cover.  Roll up like a jellyroll, pinch the seams closed and continue as directed in the recipe.
