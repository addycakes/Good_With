  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  spicy pork bulk sausage
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  diced onion
  1                cup  diced peeled cored apple
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh sage
  1                     bay leaf
  8               cups  cubed (1") French bread with crusts
                        = (from a 1-lb loaf)
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3              large  eggs -- beaten to blend

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add sausage; sautÈ until cooked through and brown, breaking into pieces with spoon, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to large bowl.  Add celery and next 6 ingredients to drippings in skillet.  SautÈ over medium heat until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.  Add mixture to sausage.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Reheat to lukewarm before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add bread to sausage mixture.  Whisk milk, broth, and butter in bowl to blend.  Mix into stuffing; season stuffing with salt and pepper.  Mix in eggs; transfer to prepared dish.  Bake uncovered until cooked through and brown, about 50 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This delicious stuffing is similar to a savory bread pudding.  It's best baked alongside, rather than inside, the bird.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried tart cherries
     1/2           cup  Merlot
                        === CRUST ===
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 3/4           cups  chilled unsalted butter - (3 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  4             pounds  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut 1 1/2" chunks - (abt 12 cups)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for glaze
  2        tablespoons  raw sugar crystals
                        = (or granulated sugar)
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Bring cherries and Merlot to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Remove from heat and cool.  Let stand at room temperature overnight.  Drain well.

For Crust:  Combine flour, butter, sugar, and salt in bowl of electric mixer.  Place bowl in freezer 15 minutes.  Using electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat mixture on low speed until pea-size clumps form.  Drizzle 2/3 cup ice water over mixture and beat just until dough comes together.  Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap each separately in plastic; chill at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.

Let 1 dough disk stand at room temperature 15 minutes to soften slightly.  Roll out on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold in overhang, forming double-thick sides.  Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss apples, 1/3 cup sugar, and cinnamon in large bowl to combine.  Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until apples soften slightly, about 15 minutes.  Cool apple mixture.  Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Toss cherries, apple mixture, and hazelnuts in large bowl to combine.

Let second dough disk stand at room temperature 15 minutes to soften slightly.  Roll out disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer filling to dough-lined dish.  Brush edge of crust with egg glaze.  Drape dough over filling.  Trim top dough overhang to 1 inch.  Press top and bottom dough edges together to seal.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Using sharp knife, cut 4 slashes in top of dough to allow steam to escape.  Brush dough with egg glaze; sprinkle with raw sugar crystals.

Bake pie 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Tent pie with foil.  Continue baking until apples are tender and juices are bubbling thickly, about 25 minutes longer.  Cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand on rack at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Bring cherries and Merlot to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Remove from heat and cool.  Let stand at room temperature overnight.  Drain well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Crust:  Combine flour, butter, sugar, and salt in bowl of electric mixer.  Place bowl in freezer 15 minutes.  Using electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat mixture on low speed until pea-size clumps form.  Drizzle 2/3 cup ice water over mixture and beat just until dough comes together.  Gather dough into ball; divide into 2 pieces.  Flatten each into disk.  Wrap each separately in plastic; chill at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let 1 dough disk stand at room temperature 15 minutes to soften slightly.  Roll out on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold in overhang, forming double-thick sides.  Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss apples, 1/3 cup sugar, and cinnamon in large bowl to combine.  Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until apples soften slightly, about 15 minutes.  Cool apple mixture.  Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Toss cherries, apple mixture, and hazelnuts in large bowl to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let second dough disk stand at room temperature 15 minutes to soften slightly.  Roll out disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer filling to dough-lined dish.  Brush edge of crust with egg glaze.  Drape dough over filling.  Trim top dough overhang to 1 inch.  Press top and bottom dough edges together to seal.  Crimp edges decoratively.  Using sharp knife, cut 4 slashes in top of dough to allow steam to escape.  Brush dough with egg glaze; sprinkle with raw sugar crystals.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake pie 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Tent pie with foil.  Continue baking until apples are tender and juices are bubbling thickly, about 25 minutes longer.  Cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand on rack at room temperature.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  15              cups  cubed (1") crustless sourdough bread
                        = (from two 1-lb loaves)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  Italian sweet sausages -- casings removed
  2               cups  chopped onions
     3/4           cup  chopped celery
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1            package  frozen artichoke hearts - (8 oz) -- thawed, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh mint
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - -- (abt 3 oz)
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Divide bread between 2 baking sheets.  Bake until cubes are dry but not hard, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sausage and sautÈ until cooked through, breaking up with back of fork, about 5 minutes.  Add onions, celery, and garlic.  SautÈ until celery is soft, about 10 minutes.  Mix in artichokes, thyme, and mint; sautÈ 2 minutes longer.  Transfer sausage mixture to large bowl.  (Bread and sausage mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately.  Store bread at room temperature.  Refrigerate sausage mixture and reheat to lukewarm before continuing.)

Add bread to sausage mixture; toss to blend well.  Mix in cheese, then 1 cup broth.  Season with salt and pepper.

To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill main cavity and neck cavity of turkey with stuffing.  Add enough broth to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 cup to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover dish with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish -- alongside turkey or while turkey is resting -- until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing in dish.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake stuffing in dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add enough extra broth to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Susan Murphy, Kansas City, MO
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2           packages  banana muffin mix - (6.4 oz ea)
  1                cup  mashed ripe bananas - (abt 2)
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     2/3           cup  whole milk
  2              large  egg whites
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === FROSTING ===
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
  2 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  3                     ripe bananas
  1                cup  walnuts - (4 oz) -- toasted, chopped

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.

Combine banana muffin mix, mashed ripe bananas, eggs, vegetable oil, and whole milk in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat mixture at medium speed until well blended, about 2 minutes.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, beating until mixture is stiff but not dry.  Fold egg whites into batter in 2 additions.  Divide cake batter between prepared pans.

Bake cake batter until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Turn out cakes onto racks and cool completely.

For Frosting:  Stir chopped white chocolate in top of double boiler over barely simmering water until almost melted.  Remove from over water; stir white chocolate until smooth.  Cool to lukewarm, about 4 minutes.

Beat cream cheese and unsalted butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually beat in lukewarm white chocolate, then powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice.

Place 1 cake layer on platter.  Spread with 1 1/3 cups white chocolate-cream cheese frosting.  Thinly slice 2 bananas.  Arrange banana slices over frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Press toasted chopped walnuts into frosting on sides of cake.  Refrigerate cake until frosting is set, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

Slice remaining banana; arrange slices atop cake and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Susan Murphy of Kansas City, Missouri, writes: "My daughter and I love to spruce up boxed cake mixes with spices, nuts, or fruit.  One afternoon we decided to experiment with banana muffin mix instead.  We made a very moist cake, filled it with fresh banana slices, then topped it with creamy homemade frosting.  It's one of our favorite creations to date."

Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORTBREAD ===
  3 1/2         ounces  crumbled blue cheese - (abt 1/2 cup)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  walnuts -- finely chopped
                        === ROULADE ===
  1            package  chilled cream cheese - (8 oz)
     2/3           cup  purchased spiced cranberry-apple chutney
     1/2           cup  very thinly-sliced green onions

For Shortbread:  Blend blue cheese and butter in processor until creamy.  Add flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper.  Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add walnuts and process just until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball.  Flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Roll out dough between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness.  Remove top sheet.  Using 2 1/2- by 1-inch leaf-shaped cookie cutter, cut out leaves.  Transfer leaves to prepared baking sheets.  Gather dough scraps and reroll; cut out additional leaves.  Transfer to prepared baking sheets.  Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer leaves to rack and cool.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

For Roulade:  Using rolling pin, flatten cream cheese between sheets of plastic wrap; roll into 10- by 8-inch rectangle.  Remove top sheet of plastic wrap.  Spread 1/3 cup chutney atop cream cheese rectangle, leaving 1-inch plain border.  Sprinkle chutney with 2 tablespoons green onions.  Using plastic as aid and starting at 1 long side, roll up cream cheese, jelly-roll style, into log.  Gently press remaining green onions onto roulade.  Wrap roulade tightly with plastic.  Refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

Place roulade on platter.  Surround with shortbread leaves.  Top roulade with remaining 1/3 cup chutney and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  You can start making these savory cookies up to three days ahead.  Even easier: Serve the cheese roll with store-bought crackers.  (We especially liked this roulade made with a spiced cranberry-apple chutney, but any thick chutney will work.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  4                     containers fresh blueberries - (1/2 pt ea)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- lightly toasted
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2           cup  red currant jelly -- for glaze

For filling:  Combine 2 baskets berries, sugar, and lemon juice in heavy medium saucepan.  Coarsely mash berries.  Stir over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture boils and thickens, about 7 minutes.

Whisk yolks and cornstarch in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in half of hot berry mixture; return to pan.  Stir over medium-high heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 3 minutes.  Whisk in butter and lemon peel.  Transfer filling to bowl.  Cover and chill overnight.

For crust:  Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Blend flour, 1/4 cup sliced almonds, sugar, and salt in processor until almonds are finely ground.  Add butter; using on/off turns, cut in until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Whisk egg yolk and almond extract in small bowl; add to processor and blend until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan.  Pierce crust all over with fork; freeze 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake until crust is set, about 12 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake until crust is golden, about 18 minutes longer.  Cool crust completely on rack.

Spread filling in crust; sprinkle remaining 2 baskets berries over.  Stir currant jelly in small saucepan over medium heat until melted; brush over berries.  Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sliced almonds around edge of tart.  Cover loosely with foil and chill at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Remove pan sides.  Place tart on platter.  Serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Ground almonds add a delicate nutty flavor to the crust.  Begin making the filling a day before assembling the tart; once completed, it can be chilled another day before serving.

              Butterflied Leg Of Lamb With Thyme And Orange

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated orange peel
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     boneless leg of lamb - (4 lbs) -- fat well trimmed
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Combine thyme, orange peel, garlic, salt, and pepper in small bowl.  Open lamb on rimmed baking sheet.  Using small sharp knife, make twelve 1/2-inch-deep slits on each side of lamb.  Fill each slit with 1/2 teaspoon thyme mixture.  Rub any remaining thyme mixture over both sides of lamb.  Brush lamb lightly with olive oil.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Let stand 2 hours at room temperature or cover and refrigerate up to 1 day.)

Preheat broiler.  Broil lamb 4 inches from heat source until brown and crusty and meat thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 8 minutes per side.  Transfer lamb to platter.  Let stand 15 minutes.  Slice thinly across grain.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is exactly the kind of dish that conjures up visions of Greeks spit-roasting lamb on rocky hills above the sea, and basting it with branches of thyme dipped in olive oil.  (Which is not a bad recipe itself, especially if you have the rocky hills and sea.)

         Calvados-Laced Squash Soup With Cinnamon And Bay Leaves

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  butternut squash - (abt 2 very large) -- halved lengthwise
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2                     cinnamon sticks -- broken in half
  2                     bay leaves -- broken in half
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  Calvados (apple brandy)
                        = (or brandy)
  4               cans  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz ea)
  1                can  evaporated milk - (12 oz)
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  warm water
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with aluminum foil.  Brush squash flesh with 2 tablespoons oil.  Place on prepared baking sheets, cut-side down.  Roast squash until very tender, about 1 hour.  Cool 20 minutes.  Remove seeds.  Scoop out 6 cups squash pulp and transfer to large bowl (reserve any remaining squash for another use).

Melt butter with remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add onions, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, salt, and pepper.  SautÈ until onions are soft, about 10 minutes.  Add Calvados and simmer until almost all of liquid evaporates, about 1 minute.  Discard cinnamon stick pieces and bay leaves.  Add mixture to squash in large bowl and stir to combine.  Working in batches, puree squash mixture in blender with chicken broth and evaporated milk until smooth.  Strain into same pot, pressing on solids in strainer to extract as much liquid as possible.

Mix sour cream, 1 tablespoon warm water, and ground cinnamon in medium bowl to blend.  (Soup and cinnamon cream can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool soup slightly, then cover and refrigerate.  Cover and refrigerate cinnamon cream.)

Bring soup to simmer.  Ladle soup into bowls.  Garnish each with dollop of cinnamon cream and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Dollops of cinnamon-flavored sour cream top this luscious soup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted
     1/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature,
                        cut into pieces
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
  1                cup  walnuts -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  7             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

For Crust:  Blend flour, almonds, walnuts, and salt in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add powdered sugar and combine using on/off turns.  Add butter; using on/off turns, cut in until coarse meal forms.  With machine running, slowly add egg.  Blend until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill 30 minutes.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer dough to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim excess dough flush with top edge of pan.  Pierce bottom of dough all over with fork.  Chill 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bake crust until golden, about 35 minutes.  Transfer to rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Place sugar, 1/2 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in butter and cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  When bubbling subsides, whisk in crËme fraÓche.  Cool caramel until beginning to thicken.  Stir in walnuts.  Pour caramel into prepared crust.  Let stand 15 minutes to spread.

For Chocolate Glaze:  Bring cream to boil in medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until melted and smooth.  Cool 5 minutes.  Pour enough glaze over caramel to cover and fill tart to just below edge of crust (reserve remaining glaze for another use).  Let stand until set, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  A classic combination of tender shortcrust pastry and soft, candy-like caramel filling.

Pour enough glaze over caramel to cover and fill tart to just below edge of crust (reserve remaining glaze for another use).  Let stand until set, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 3/4           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  chilled whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  chilled sour cream
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
                        === CRANBERRY TOPPING ===
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
  1                cup  ruby Port
  1                cup  sugar
  1              whole  star anise -- see * Note
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2                     whole cloves
  2                     strips orange peel - (2" long)
  2               cups  fresh cranberries or frozen -- thawed

* Note:  A brown star-shaped seedpod that can be found at Asian markets and specialty foods stores, as well as in the spice section of some supermarkets.

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Blend graham cracker crumbs and sugar in processor until combined.  Gradually add butter and process until moist clumps form.  Press crumbs onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up sides of 10-inch-diameter springform pan with removable bottom.  Bake until set, about 12 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool completely.

For Filling:  Place 1/2 cup whipping cream in medium bowl; sprinkle gelatin over.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Combine 1 cup whipping cream and cream cheese in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk over medium-high heat until mixture is smooth and just beginning to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Add gelatin mixture; whisk to dissolve.  Strain into large bowl.  Let stand 45 minutes to cool.

Combine remaining 1 1/2 cups whipping cream, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in another large bowl.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; reserve bean for another use.  Using electric mixer, beat until mixture thickens and peaks form.  Fold into cream cheese mixture in 3 additions.  Transfer filling to prepared crust.  Cover and chill until set, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.

For Cranberry Topping:  Place 1 tablespoon water in small bowl.  Sprinkle gelatin over.  Let stand 5 minutes.

Bring Port, sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel to boil in heavy large saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes.  Add cranberries and simmer mixture until cranberries begin to pop, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir some of hot cranberry liquid into gelatin mixture in small bowl to melt gelatin; stir gelatin mixture into cranberry mixture in saucepan.  Transfer to medium bowl; refrigerate until cold.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Just before serving, remove pan sides to release tart.  Cut cheesecake tart into wedges.  Spoon cranberry mixture over each wedge and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This elegant no-bake cheesecake has a smooth, airy filling similar to a mousse. To make the graham cracker crumbs, blend graham cracker pieces in a food processor.

          Chestnut, Bacon, Dried Apple, And Corn Bread Stuffing

Recipe By     :Bruce Aidells
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dressing/Stuffing               Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  thick-cut bacon slices -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-wide strips
  4               cups  chopped onions
  3               cups  chopped celery
  1                cup  chopped dried apples
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried rubbed sage
  2               jars  roasted whole chestnuts - (7.4 ea) -- coarsely broken
  8               cups  dried corn bread stuffing mix
                        = (from two 16-oz packages)
  1 3/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted

Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to large bowl.  Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet.  Add onions and celery to drippings in skillet.  Cover and cook over medium heat until vegetables are soft, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Add vegetables to bacon; mix in apples, thyme, and sage, then chestnuts.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Reheat to lukewarm before continuing.)

Add corn bread stuffing mix to chestnut mixture.  Mix in 1 3/4 cups broth.  Drizzle with butter.

To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill main cavity and neck cavity of turkey with stuffing.  Add enough broth to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 cup to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover dish with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish --- alongside turkey or while turkey is resting -- until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing in dish.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake stuffing in dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add enough extra broth to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Two shortcuts -- prepared chestnuts and a purchased corn bread stuffing base -- add to the appeal of this recipe from chef and Aidells Sausage Company founder Bruce Aidells.

<DirT>
Add corn bread stuffing mix to chestnut mixture.  Mix in 1 3/4 cups broth.  Drizzle with butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill main cavity and neck cavity of turkey with stuffing.  Add enough broth to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 cup to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover dish with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish --- alongside turkey or while turkey is resting -- until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing in dish.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To bake stuffing in dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add enough extra broth to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Two shortcuts -- prepared chestnuts and a purchased corn bread stuffing base -- add to the appeal of this recipe from chef and Aidells Sausage Company founder Bruce Aidells.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COCONUT RICE PUDDING ===
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  basmati rice
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar

  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  4          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1                cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  shredded coconut -- toasted
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        === MACAROON CRUMBLE ===
  1 1/2           cups  sweetened flaked coconut
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  4 1/2    tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- diced
  2               cups  chopped peeled fresh pineapple
  1                cup  chopped peeled pitted fresh mango

* Note:  Unsweetened coconut milk is available at Indian, Southeast Asian, and Latin American markets and many supermarkets.

For rice pudding:  Bring 3 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Add rice; reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until very tender, about 18 minutes.  Drain if necessary.

Whisk 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, eggs, egg yolks, cornstarch, and vanilla in large bowl to combine.  Bring whole milk, coconut milk, remaining 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Pour over sugar-egg mixture, whisking constantly.

Strain mixture back into saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat.  Whisk gently until slightly thickened.  Remove from heat.  Fold in cooked rice and coconut.  Pour into bowl, pressing plastic wrap onto surface, and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)  Stir in cream.

For macaroon crumble:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Toss coconut, flour, both sugars, and salt in large bowl to combine.  Using fingertips, rub butter into mixture until clumps form.  Spread mixture on baking sheet, patting down slightly.  Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Cool.  Break crumble into bite-size pieces.

Toss pineapple and mango in bowl to combine.  Spoon 1/4 cup rice pudding into each of 6 wineglasses.  Top each with 1/4 cup fruit mixture.  Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons macaroon crumble.  Repeat with remaining pudding and fruit mixture (reserve remaining pudding for another use).  Sprinkle each parfait with 2 tablespoons macaroon crumble and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "The last time we went to Las Vegas," writes Timothy Arndt of Austin, Texas, "I took my girlfriend out to dinner at Olives in the Bellagio, and we were both impressed with the food and the gorgeous setting.  Best of all was dessert -- we shared a creamy and exotic coconut rice pudding with tropical fruit."

Use any leftover macaroon crumble over ice cream or fresh fruit.

Spread flaked coconut on large baking sheet.  Bake until lightly toasted, stirring once, about 14 minutes.  Cool.  (Cakes and coconut can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature.)

For filling:  Stir preserves in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted.  Cool slightly.  Toss peaches, sugar, and lemon juice in large bowl.  Add preserves and toss to combine.

For frosting:  Beat first 3 ingredients in large bowl until peaks form.

Drain peach filling of excess juices.  Cut cakes horizontally in half.  Place 1 cake layer, cut-side up, on platter.  Top with 1/3 of peach filling.  Spread 1 cup frosting over filling.  Repeat layering 2 more times, then top with final cake layer, cut-side down.  Spread top and sides of cake with remaining frosting.  Cover cake completely with toasted coconut.  Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.  Fan peach slices atop center of cake before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Cream of coconut is added to the batter and the whipped cream frosting.  You can make and chill the cake up to one day ahead.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  1 1/2           cups  cubed (1/4") Black Forest ham - (8 oz)

  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried marjoram
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  dried sage
     3/4      teaspoon  fennel seeds
                        Roasted Red Pepper Corn Bread -- (see recipe),
                        crumbled
  6               cups  cubed (1/2") crustless French bread
                        = (from a 1-lb loaf)

Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover dish with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish -- alongside turkey or while turkey is resting -- until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing in dish.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Toss shallots with oil and 3 teaspoons thyme on small rimmed baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake until golden, about 25 minutes.  Mix 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 tablespoon sugar in small bowl.  Drizzle over shallots; toss to coat.  Continue roasting until shallots caramelize, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Remove from oven.

Bring Port, brown sugar, 4 tablespoons vinegar, and 1/2 cup sugar to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add cranberries and currants; cook until berries pop, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Mix in marjoram and 2 teaspoons thyme.  Mix in shallots.  Transfer to bowl.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)  Serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 4 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed, dark
                        gills removed, caps cut into 3/4" pieces
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        caps cut into 3/4" pieces
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cans  vegetable broth - (14 oz ea) -- or more if needed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  Madeira -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Madeira
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whipping cream
     3/4      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with foil.  Divide mushrooms between prepared baking sheets.  Drizzle mushrooms on each sheet with 3 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper; toss to coat.  Cover with foil.  Bake mushrooms 30 minutes.  Uncover and continue baking until mushrooms are tender and still moist, about 15 minutes longer.  Cool slightly.  Puree half of mushrooms with 1 can broth in blender until smooth.  Set mushroom puree aside.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic and sautÈ until onion is tender, about 8 minutes.  Add Madeira and simmer until almost all of liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Add flour; stir 2 minutes.  Add 2 cans broth, cream, and thyme.  Stir in remaining cooked mushroom pieces and mushroom puree.  Simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.  Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer before serving, thinning with additional broth if necessary.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Big chunks of portobello and shiitake mushrooms make for a hearty soup.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     2/3           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  ancho chili powder
                        = (or regular chili powder)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     boned skinned chicken breast halves -- pounded to 1/2"
                        to 1/3" thickness
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
     2/3           cup  low-salt chicken broth
  1                cup  bottled green salsa
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1              large  avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced

Pour buttermilk into shallow dish.  Combine cornmeal, chili powder, and salt in separate shallow dish.  Place chicken in buttermilk and turn to coat.  Place chicken in cornmeal mixture and turn to coat.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add 2 chicken breasts; sautÈ until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to plate; tent with foil.  Repeat with remaining oil and chicken.

Add broth to drippings in skillet.  Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring to scrape up browned bits.  Stir in salsa; simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.  Mix in cilantro.  Divide chicken among 4 plates.  Spoon sauce over chicken.  Top with avocado slices and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This southwestern version of fried chicken needs only two sides: purchased Mexican-style rice pilaf and a sautÈ of bell peppers and carrots.  Flan with sliced kiwi would be a nice finish.  Look for ancho chili powder in the spice section of your supermarket.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     2/3           cup  dried currants
  1 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  2               cups  old-fashioned oats

Whisk eggs and vanilla in small bowl to blend.  Mix in dried currants; cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 3 large baking sheets.

Sift flour, baking soda, salt, and spices into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Add sugar and beat until smooth.  Add currant mixture and beat to blend.  Stir in flour mixture.  Mix in oats.

This recipe yields about 45 cookies.

Comments:  "I literally didn't know how to boil an egg until I was in my 20s -- when I tried to impress a guy by making dinner for him," writes Sally Siegel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  "I didn't have much success with the dinner or the guy, but I regrouped and put together a repertoire of fairly elegant dishes I felt confident making.  Over the years, my cooking style has become more casual; I make dishes that are not too demanding, but still special for company."

Comments:  &quot;I literally didn&apos;t know how to boil an egg until I was in my 20s -- when I tried to impress a guy by making dinner for him,&quot; writes Sally Siegel of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  &quot;I didn&apos;t have much success with the dinner or the guy, but I regrouped and put together a repertoire of fairly elegant dishes I felt confident making.  Over the years, my cooking style has become more casual; I make dishes that are not too demanding, but still special for company.&quot;

  4             medium  fresh fennel bulbs - (abt 2 lbs) -- trimmed, cored,
                        the bulbs coarsely chopped, and
                        the fronds chopped and reserved
  2             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  half-and-half -- or more if needed
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- crushed in
                        resealable plastic bag with meat mallet
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried tarragon

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Add fennel bulbs; cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  Add potatoes and boil gently until fennel and potatoes are very tender, about 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup half-and-half, fennel seeds, and tarragon in small saucepan; bring to simmer.  Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.

Drain potato mixture; return to pot.  Stir over medium heat until any excess liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Add hot half-and-half mixture and butter and mash until vegetables are almost smooth (small fennel bits may still remain).  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead; cover and chill.  Rewarm covered with plastic wrap in microwave, stirring occasionally and thinning with more half-and-half, if desired.)

Transfer mashed potato mixture to bowl.  Sprinkle with reserved chopped fennel fronds and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Both fresh fennel and fennel seeds flavor this creamy mash of Yukon Golds.  It can be made eight hours ahead and rewarmed.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place beans in large pot.  Add enough cold water to cover beans by 3 inches.  Let stand overnight.

Drain beans well.  Return to pot.  Add 16 cups water, 5 unpeeled garlic cloves, and celery stalk.  Bring mixture to boil; reduce heat to low and simmer 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add vegetable mixture to bean mixture in pot.  Simmer soup until beans are tender, about 45 minutes.

Cook pasta in another large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain well.  Add cooked pasta and remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil to soup, stirring to combine.  Thin soup with more water, if desired.  Season soup to taste with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 12 first-course or 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  "My husband and I just returned from a trip to Italy," writes Kim Riemann of North Brunswick, New Jersey.  "Of all the great meals we had there, a few stand out in my memory.  One was at Buca Mario in Florence.  The rosemary-scented bean soup was unforgettable."

Serve this with a drizzle of olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  Guinness extra stout or dark beer
  1                cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
                        === CANDIED PISTACHIOS ===
  1                cup  finely-chopped pistachios
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === CREAM CHEESE FROSTING ===
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     3/4      teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel
  2               cups  powdered sugar

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour three 8-inch-diameter cake pans.  Bring stout and molasses to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat.  Remove from heat; stir in baking soda.  Let stand 1 hour to cool completely.

Whisk flour and next 6 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Whisk eggs and both sugars in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk in oil, then stout mixture.  Gradually whisk stout-egg mixture into flour mixture.  Stir in fresh ginger.

Divide batter among prepared pans.  Bake until tester inserted into centers of cakes comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans 15 minutes.  Invert cakes onto racks; cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap each cake separately in plastic and keep at room temperature.)

For Candied Pistachios:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Mix pistachios and corn syrup in medium bowl.  Add sugar and toss to coat.  Working quickly so sugar doesn't melt, spread pistachios on prepared baking sheet.  Bake until pistachios are pale golden, about 8 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Cream Cheese Frosting:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, butter, and orange peel in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually beat in powdered sugar.  Chill frosting 30 minutes.

Place 1 cake layer, rounded-side up, on platter.  Spread 3/4 cup frosting over.  Top with second cake layer, rounded-side up, then spread 3/4 cup frosting over.  Top with third cake layer, flat-side up.  Spread top and sides of cake with remaining frosting.  Sprinkle top of cake with candied pistachios.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)  Cut cake into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Dark beer and molasses add rich depth of flavor to this moist and delicious cake.

               Gingered Spareribs With Brown Sugar And Soy

Recipe By     :Lyn Utsugi, Kamuela, HI
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3             pounds  well-trimmed pork spareribs -- cut individual ribs
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     3/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/2           cup  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- (optional)
                        Steamed white rice -- for serving

Heat vegetable oil in large wide shallow pot over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, add ribs and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes.  Transfer ribs to large bowl.

Add garlic and ginger to pot; sautÈ 30 seconds.  Add brown sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce.  Stir to blend.  Return ribs to pot.  Cover pot and simmer over medium-low heat until meat is tender, turning ribs occasionally, about 45 minutes.  If sauce is thin, gradually add cornstarch mixture to ribs and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.  Serve ribs over rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "My paternal grandmother liked to serve these spareribs on special occasions," writes Lyn Utsugi of Kamuela, Hawaii.  "She was a great cook and even owned a restaurant on Oahu in the late 1950s.  My mother learned the recipe from her and has been making the ribs since 1961, the year she married my father."

Serve these with steamed rice, perfect for soaking up the extra sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
                        = (available at Italian markets,
                        specialty foods stores, and many
                        supermarkets)
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks)
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps sliced
  1              pound  button mushrooms -- sliced
  1 1/2           cups  chopped leeks, white and pale green only
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2                 French-bread baguettes - (8 oz ea) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/2"-thick slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend

Combine 1 1/2 cups hot water and dried porcini in small bowl.  Let stand until mushrooms soften, about 30 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface; chop finely.  Pour mushroom soaking liquid into small bowl, leaving any sediment behind, and reserve.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add shiitake and button mushrooms; sautÈ 10 minutes.  Add leeks and garlic; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add wine, thyme, and porcini mushrooms.  Cook until almost all wine evaporates, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover mushroom mixture and porcini soaking liquid separately and chill.  Reheat mushroom mixture to lukewarm before continuing.)  Transfer mixture to very large bowl.

Mix bread into mushroom mixture.  Season with salt and pepper; mix in egg.

To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill main cavity and neck cavity of turkey with stuffing.  Add enough mushroom soaking liquid to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 cup to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover dish with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish -- alongside turkey or while turkey is resting -- until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing in dish.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake stuffing in dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add enough reserved mushroom soaking liquid to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Bake uncovered until heated through, about 40 minutes.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                 Maple Creme Flan With Maple-Glazed Pears

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FLAN ===
  1                cup  pure maple syrup
  3 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  7              large  egg yolks
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  light corn syrup
                        === PEARS ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  3                     ripe Bartlett pears -- unpeeled, quartered,
                        and cored
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/4           cup  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

For Flan:  Simmer maple syrup in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 7 minutes.  Stir in cream; return to simmer.

Whisk egg yolks in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture.  Whisk in salt.  Strain custard into another large bowl.  Cover and chill until cold, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Stir sugar, 1/4 cup water, and light corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 6 minutes.

Pour syrup into 9 1/4- by 5 1/4- by 3-inch nonstick metal loaf pan, tilting pan carefully to coat sides.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Pour custard into pan with syrup.  Place loaf pan in large roasting pan.  Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come halfway up sides of loaf pan.  Cover roasting pan with foil.  Pierce foil all over with fork.  Bake flan 1 hour 45 minutes.

Increase oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Uncover and bake until flan is set around edges but center moves slightly when pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour longer.  Remove flan from water.  Transfer to rack; cool to room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

For Pears:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Melt butter in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Arrange pears, 1 cut side down, in skillet.  Cook until brown, about 4 minutes.  Turn onto second cut side and cook until brown, about 4 minutes longer.

Stir in maple syrup; bring to boil.  Place in oven and bake until pears are tender, about 25 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer pears to plate.  Whisk crËme fraÓche and salt into sauce in skillet.  Return pears to skillet and toss to coat.

Run sharp knife around edge of flan to loosen.  Invert flan onto platter.  Surround with pears and sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Begin making this ultra-creamy flan (think crËme br˚lÈe) one day before serving.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  fresh tangerine juice
  3        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  grated tangerine peel
  2 1/2         pounds  large carrots - (abt 12) -- peeled, cut on
                        diagonal 1/2"-thk ovals - (abt 6 cups)
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         large  tangerine -- seeded
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Boil until sauce thickens and coats spoon thickly and is reduced to 2/3 cup, whisking occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Steam carrots until just crisp-tender, about 7 minutes.  Mix carrots and cayenne pepper into sauce.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Simmer carrots in sauce over medium heat until heated through and sauce reduces to thick glaze, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl.  Squeeze juice from tangerine half over.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Tangerine juice adds an intriguing note to the velvety sauce.  Look for the largest possible tangerines to make squeezing easier.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  2               cups  crumbled creamy blue cheese - (abt 8 oz)
                        = (such as Bleu d'Auvergne)
     1/2           cup  whole milk -- or more if needed
  2 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh rosemary sprigs -- (optional)

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain well.  Return potatoes to pot.  Add cheese and 1/2 cup milk and mash until almost smooth, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls for desired consistency.  Stir in chopped rosemary.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead; cover and chill.  Rewarm covered with plastic wrap in microwave, stirring occasionally and adding more milk, if desired.)

Transfer mashed potatoes to bowl.  Garnish with rosemary sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A rich, delicious stove-top side dish with a silky texture.  This pairs especially well with the "Porcini-Rubbed Turkey with Shiitake-Madeira Gravy" (see recipe) -- or grilled steaks on any other day in November.  You can make the potatoes eight hours ahead and reheat them just before serving.

Add cheese and 1/2 cup milk and mash until almost smooth, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls for desired consistency.  Stir in chopped rosemary.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead; cover and chill.  Rewarm covered with plastic wrap in microwave, stirring occasionally and adding more milk, if desired.)

Comments:  A rich, delicious stove-top side dish with a silky texture.  This pairs especially well with the &quot;Porcini-Rubbed Turkey with Shiitake-Madeira Gravy&quot; (see recipe) -- or grilled steaks on any other day in November.  You can make the potatoes eight hours ahead and reheat them just before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STOCK ===
  5               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2             medium  carrots -- chopped
  2              large  celery stalks -- chopped
  1                     onion -- halved
  2              small  bay leaves
                        Neck, heart, and gizzard reserved
                        from an 18- to 20-lb turkey
                        === BRINE AND TURKEY ===
  1                     turkey - (18 to 20 lbs)
  7             quarts  water
  2               cups  coarse salt - (abt 9 oz)
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
  2            bunches  fresh thyme
  1              bunch  fresh sage
  2             quarts  ice cubes
  2              large  onions -- halved
  1                     garlic head -- halved horizontally
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth - (about)
                        === GRAVY ===
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  20                    gingersnap cookies -- coarsely crumbled
                        = (about 1 3/4 cups)
  3        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar - (to 4)
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  whipping cream -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Stock:  Combine broth, carrots, celery, onion, and bay leaves in large saucepan.  Add reserved neck, heart, and gizzard.  Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until stock is reduced to 3 1/4 cups, about 1 hour.  Strain turkey stock into medium bowl.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover stock and refrigerate.)

For Brine and Turkey:  Line very large (about 16-quart) bowl with two 30-gallon plastic bags, one inside the other.  Rinse turkey inside and out.  Place turkey in plastic-lined bowl.  Combine 7 quarts water, salt, sugar, molasses, 1 bunch thyme, and 1/2 bunch sage in large bowl or pot.  Stir until salt and sugar dissolve.  Mix in ice cubes.  Pour brine over turkey in plastic bags.  Gather tops of bags together, eliminating air space above brine; seal bags.  Refrigerate turkey in brine 18 to 20 hours.

Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Remove turkey from brine.  Drain very well; discard brine.  Pat turkey dry inside and out.  Place turkey on small rack set in large roasting pan.  Fill main cavity with remaining 1 bunch thyme and 1/2 bunch sage, onions, and garlic.  Stir oil, pepper, chopped thyme, and chopped sage in small bowl to form paste; smear all over outside of turkey.  Tuck wing tips under; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.

Roast turkey 1 hour, tenting loosely with foil if browning quickly.  Turn pan around; roast turkey 30 minutes.  Pour 1 cup broth over turkey; re-tent loosely with foil.  Roast turkey, basting with 1 cup broth every 30 minutes until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, about 2 hours longer.  Transfer turkey to platter.  Remove vegetables and herbs from main cavity and discard.  Spoon any juices from cavity into roasting pan.  Let turkey stand 30 minutes (internal temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

For Gravy:  Strain pan juices into bowl.  Spoon off fat, reserving 2 tablespoons.  Heat reserved 2 tablespoons turkey fat in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and thyme.  SautÈ until onion browns, about 10 minutes.  Add turkey stock, gingersnaps, 3 tablespoons cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce.  Add 2 cups degreased pan juices and bring to boil, whisking to dissolve gingersnaps.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until gravy thickens, about 4 minutes.  Season gravy to taste with salt and pepper, adding remaining tablespoon vinegar and cream, if desired.

Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Comments:  Brining ensures moist, succulent meat, and this recipe from Bruce Aidells, chef and founder of Aidells Sausage Company, could not be easier or more low-tech.  The special equipment required?  Two 30-gallon plastic bags and one very large (16-quart) bowl that will fit in the fridge.  You'll want to get started a day ahead, because the turkey is brined for 18 to 20 hours.  Stuffing this turkey is not recommended; the brine remaining in the meat may soak into the stuffing during roasting.

  2                     fresh sage sprigs -- (optional)
  1                cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  5               cups  low-salt chicken broth - (about)
                        === GRAVY ===
  4 1/2    tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  minced onion
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              large  Gala apple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/4" cubes
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth
     3/4           cup  apple cider
  2              small  bay leaves -- torn into pieces
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  mustard seeds -- coarsely crushed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Turkey:  Mix first 6 ingredients in small bowl.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Place on rack set in large roasting pan.  Rub inside of main cavity and neck cavity with orange quarters (reserve orange quarters); sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Rub herb butter over outside of turkey.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  If not stuffing turkey, fill main cavity and neck cavity with orange quarters, onion, garlic, celery, thyme sprigs, and sage sprigs.  If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into both cavities.  Tuck wing tips under; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.

Mix orange juice and Dijon mustard in small bowl; pour into pan around turkey.  Place turkey in oven with tail at back.  Roast turkey 45 minutes.  Add 2 cups broth to pan; baste turkey.  Turn pan around.  Roast turkey 45 minutes.  Add 1 cup broth; baste with pan juices.  Turn pan around and cover turkey loosely with foil.  Continue to roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting with 1 cup broth and rotating pan every 45 minutes, about 1 hour 45 minutes longer if unstuffed and 2 hours 15 minutes longer if stuffed.  Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

For Gravy:  Strain pan juices into 8-cup measuring cup.  Spoon off fat.  Melt butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add flour and stir until golden, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in apple and all remaining ingredients, then pan juices.  Bring gravy to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until gravy thickens, whisking occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Season gravy with salt and pepper.

Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The gravy is a refined, delicious sauce in this duo from Barbara Shinn and David Page, co-owners of Home restaurant in New York and co-authors of Recipes from Home.

                Pan-Fried Steak In Cognac-Peppercorn Sauce

Recipe By     :Mark Van Wye, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  drained green peppercorns in brine
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  Cognac or brandy
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     top sirloin steak, 1" thick - (1 1/2 lbs)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add peppercorns and mash with back of fork.  Add broth, Cognac, and cream and boil until sauce is thick enough to coat spoon, whisking occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Set sauce aside.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper.  Add steak to skillet and sautÈ until brown and cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steak to cutting board.  Add reserved sauce to same skillet and bring to boil, stirring to scrape up browned bits.

Slice steak thinly.  Transfer steak to platter.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "I've always taken a scientific, as well as an artistic, approach to food," writes Mark Van Wye of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  "My family dined out a lot when I was young, and I became an adventurous eater.  I would try anything and everything, and eventually I'd attempt to re-create those restaurant dishes at home.  I never asked for recipes; I liked the detective work and the sense of discovery as I experimented with ingredients, just as a novice painter learns by copying the masters."

Look for green peppercorns where capers and pickles are sold in the supermarket.  (They're also good in salad dressings.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2             pounds  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  1 1/4         pounds  celery root (celeriac) -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes - (abt 2 cups)
  1 1/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  minced fresh celery leaves

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until almost tender, about 4 minutes (do not brown).  Add parsnips and celery root and toss to coat.  Add broth, whipping cream, and nutmeg and bring to boil.

Reduce heat to medium.  Cover tightly and simmer until parsnips and celery root are tender and liquid is almost absorbed, stirring occasionally and adding water by tablespoonfuls if mixture gets dry, about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm vegetables over low heat, stirring often, until heated through before continuing.)

Stir in celery leaves.  Transfer to bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This simple but satisfying dish -- full of slightly sweet parsnip and celery root chunks -- can be made ahead and just reheated before serving.

              Pasta With Meatballs In Balsamic Tomato Sauce

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  4              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2               cans  diced tomatoes with balsamic vinegar,
                        basil, and olive oil - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1              pound  purchased cooked meatballs -- (see comments)
     3/4           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
  1              pound  perciatelli or spaghetti
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic; sautÈ until soft and golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes and wine.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Add meatballs and basil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until meatballs are heated through and sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain; return to pot.  Add meatballs with sauce and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl; sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cooked meatballs can be purchased at many supermarket deli or meat departments.  They make this dinner a snap to pull together.  Toss a salad, then tuck chocolate wafers into scoops of orange sorbet for dessert.

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic; sautÈ until soft and golden, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes and wine.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Add meatballs and basil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until meatballs are heated through and sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain; return to pot.  Add meatballs with sauce and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl; sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cooked meatballs can be purchased at many supermarket deli or meat departments.  They make this dinner a snap to pull together.  Toss a salad, then tuck chocolate wafers into scoops of orange sorbet for dessert.

            Porcini-Rubbed Turkey With Shiitake-Madeira Gravy

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURKEY ===
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1                     turkey - (14 lbs) -- neck, heart, and
                        gizzard reserved for stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  1              large  onion -- cut into 8 pieces
  4             medium  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === GRAVY ===
  6               cups  Turkey Stock II -- (see recipe)
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, caps sliced
     1/2           cup  Madeira
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Turkey:  Grind dried porcini in processor until almost reduced to powder, with some larger bits remaining, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to sieve.  Shake powdered porcini into bowl; mix in 2 tablespoons butter.  Reserve larger bits in sieve.

Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry with paper towels.  Place turkey on small rack set in large roasting pan.  Rub porcini butter over outside of turkey; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bring porcini bits and chicken broth to boil in small saucepan.  Remove from heat; reserve for basting.  (Turkey and porcini broth can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into main cavity and neck cavity.  Tuck wing tips under; tie legs together loosely.  Roast turkey 1 hour 15 minutes, covering loosely with foil if browning quickly.  Toss onion, carrots, garlic, and oil in bowl to coat; scatter in pan around turkey.  Baste with 1 cup porcini broth.  Continue to roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting with 3/4 cup porcini broth and pan juices every 45 minutes, about 2 hours 30 minutes for unstuffed and 3 hours for stuffed.  Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

For Gravy:  Place roasting pan over 2 burners.  Add turkey stock and any remaining porcini broth and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Strain turkey broth into heavy large saucepan; spoon off fat.

Mix 4 tablespoons butter and flour in bowl to form paste.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms.  Cover; cook until mushrooms release liquids, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Add Madeira; boil until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Add mushroom mixture to turkey broth; bring to boil.  Whisk in flour paste.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until gravy thickens, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  With its use of dried porcini in the turkey rub and fresh shiitakes in the light gravy, this recipe from the late food writer Michael McLaughlin is a fine example of his signature style: deeply flavorful seasonal cooking.  You can make the turkey stock for the gravy up to two days ahead.

For Gravy:  Place roasting pan over 2 burners.  Add turkey stock and any remaining porcini broth and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Strain turkey broth into heavy large saucepan; spoon off fat.
</DirT>

Mix 4 tablespoons butter and flour in bowl to form paste.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms.  Cover; cook until mushrooms release liquids, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Add Madeira; boil until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Add mushroom mixture to turkey broth; bring to boil.  Whisk in flour paste.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until gravy thickens, whisking occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Comments:  With its use of dried porcini in the turkey rub and fresh shiitakes in the light gravy, this recipe from the late food writer Michael McLaughlin is a fine example of his signature style: deeply flavorful seasonal cooking.  You can make the turkey stock for the gravy up to two days ahead.

Comments:  "Last year my family spent the holidays on the Big Island of Hawaii," writes Jo Lucarz of Phoenix, Arizona.  "One afternoon we ate lunch in Kamuela at the Parker Ranch Grill, where we had the best chili ever -- and coming from a group of Arizona natives, that's saying a lot."

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8"-thick rounds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  crËme fraÓche -- stirred to loosen
  1 1/2           cups  grated GruyËre cheese - (packed) -- abt 6 oz
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Generously butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Arrange half of potato slices in bottom of prepared dish, overlapping slightly.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Spread half of crËme fraÓche over potatoes and sprinkle with half of cheese.  Top with remaining potatoes, overlapping slightly; sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Spread with remaining crËme fraÓche; sprinkle with remaining cheese.

Bake gratin uncovered 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Continue to bake gratin until potatoes are tender and top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.  Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Just four ingredients add up to a rich and delicious side dish.  Once the potatoes are sliced, the gratin comes together quickly and then bakes unattended for about an hour and 15 minutes.

CrËme fraÓche is vailable at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 1/2 cups whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat and mix in 3 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover and let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Chill until ready to use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEMIFREDDO ===
  1                cup  gingersnap cookie crumbs
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     3/4           cup  canned pure pumpkin
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light corn syrup
  4              large  egg whites
     1/2           cup  pecans -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  English toffee bits
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  crËme fraÓche or sour cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

For Semifreddo:  Line 9 1/4- by 5 1/4- by 3-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap.  Blend gingersnap crumbs and brown sugar in processor until combined.  With machine running, slowly add butter; process until moist crumbs form.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and 2 inches up sides of prepared loaf pan.  Chill 10 minutes.

Whisk pumpkin, honey, and spices in large bowl to blend.  Set aside.

Stir 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil syrup without stirring until candy thermometer registers 248 degrees, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually beat in hot sugar syrup; beat until mixture is cool, about 7 minutes.

Fold 1/3 of egg white mixture into pumpkin-spice mixture to lighten.  Fold in remaining egg white mixture.  Fold in pecans and toffee bits.  Spoon mixture into prepared crust.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until frozen, about 8 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

For Caramel Sauce:  Stir sugar, 1/4 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in 1/2 cup cream, butter, and then crËme fraÓche (mixture will bubble).  Stir in vanilla and salt.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Stir over medium heat to rewarm before serving.)

Wipe sides of loaf pan with hot wet cloth.  Invert semifreddo onto platter; remove plastic.  Cut into 1-inch-thick slices and serve with warm caramel sauce and whipped cream.

For Semifreddo:  Line 9 1/4- by 5 1/4- by 3-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap.  Blend gingersnap crumbs and brown sugar in processor until combined.  With machine running, slowly add butter; process until moist crumbs form.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and 2 inches up sides of prepared loaf pan.  Chill 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk pumpkin, honey, and spices in large bowl to blend.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil syrup without stirring until candy thermometer registers 248 degrees, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually beat in hot sugar syrup; beat until mixture is cool, about 7 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fold 1/3 of egg white mixture into pumpkin-spice mixture to lighten.  Fold in remaining egg white mixture.  Fold in pecans and toffee bits.  Spoon mixture into prepared crust.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until frozen, about 8 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Caramel Sauce:  Stir sugar, 1/4 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in 1/2 cup cream, butter, and then crËme fraÓche (mixture will bubble).  Stir in vanilla and salt.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Stir over medium heat to rewarm before serving.)

Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  14       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 3/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  1                can  pure pumpkin - (15 oz)
  1 1/4           cups  whipping cream
     3/4           cup  maple sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
                        === MERINGUE ===
  3              large  egg whites
  4               cups  powdered sugar

For Crust:  Combine flour, butter, sugar, and salt in bowl of electric mixer.  Place bowl in freezer 15 minutes.  Using electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat mixture on low speed until pea-size clumps form.  Drizzle 1/3 cup ice water over mixture and beat just until dough comes together.  Gather dough into ball.  Flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.  Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before using.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold in overhang, forming double-thick sides.  Crimp dough edge decoratively.  Refrigerate crust 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line crust with foil.  Fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and weights.  Bake until golden brown, placing aluminum foil collar around edge of crust if browning too quickly, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Whisk pumpkin, cream, maple sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Whisk in eggs.  Pour mixture into crust. Place aluminum foil collar around edge of crust.  Bake until filling is set and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Cool to room temperature.

For Meringue:  Preheat broiler.  Whisk egg whites and sugar in large metal bowl until combined.  Place bowl over saucepan of simmering water and continue whisking until mixture is just warm, about 5 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat egg-white mixture on medium-high speed until stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes.  Spread meringue atop pie, mounding in center.  Place pie in broiler and broil until meringue is brown, about 1 minute.  Cool to room temperature.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  For convenience, you can begin making the crust up to two days before you plan to serve the pie.  Maple sugar is available at some supermarkets and at natural foods stores.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  8                     bacon slices -- chopped

                        Fresh sage sprigs -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine garlic and oil in small ovenproof dish; cover tightly with foil.  Bake until garlic is very tender, about 35 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Transfer garlic and oil to processor; add butter and process until almost smooth.  Transfer garlic butter to small bowl.

SautÈ bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  (Garlic butter and bacon can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and chill.  Bring garlic butter to room temperature before using.)

Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain.  Cool slightly.  Cut potatoes in half; transfer to heavy large skillet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     red snapper fillets - (6 to 7 oz ea)
  10                    Kalamata olives -- pitted, halved
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
                        Freshly steamed white rice -- for serving

Combine plum tomatoes, shallot, and chopped thyme in small bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cut 1 sheet of aluminum foil about 18 inches long.  Place on work surface.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil in center of aluminum foil.  Place red snapper fillets side by side in center of aluminum foil.  Top with tomato mixture.  Sprinkle with olives.  Drizzle fish with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Fold foil over, enclosing contents completely and crimping edges tightly to seal.  (Can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead; refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place large baking sheet in oven and heat 10 minutes.  Place foil packet on heated baking sheet.  Bake until fish is opaque in center, about 15 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ONION BASE FOR GRAVY ===
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  4              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary

  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  honey
                        === TURKEY ===
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1                     turkey - (21 to 22 lbs) -- neck, heart,
                        and gizzard reserved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- quartered
  4 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth - (about)
  2              large  fresh rosemary sprigs
  2              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

For Gravy Base:  Melt butter in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until deep brown, about 40 minutes.  Mix in rosemary and thyme, then flour; stir 1 minute.  Add vinegar and honey; simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

For Turkey:  Mix butter and herbs in small bowl.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Place on rack set in large roasting pan.  Sprinkle inside and out with salt and pepper.  Starting at neck end, slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Spread 1/4 cup herb butter over breast meat under skin.  Rub remaining butter over outside of turkey.  Place turkey parts and onion quarters in pan around turkey.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into main cavity and neck cavity.  Tuck wing tips under; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Roast turkey uncovered 1 hour.  Tent turkey breast and tops of drumsticks loosely with foil; roast 1 hour longer.  Add 1 cup broth, herb sprigs, and bay leaf to drippings in pan.  Continue to roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting with 3/4 cup broth and pan juices every 30 minutes, about 2 hours 30 minutes longer for unstuffed and 3 hours longer for stuffed.  Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

Strain pan juices into 8-cup measuring cup; spoon fat off top.  Heat gravy base over medium heat.  Whisk in flour, then pan juices.  Boil until gravy is reduced to 7 cups, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 14 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     Italian hot sausages -- casings removed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - -- (abt 3 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg yolk
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  24             large  mushrooms - (abt 2" dia) -- stemmed
     1/3           cup  dry white wine

SautÈ sausage and oregano in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until sausage is cooked through and brown, breaking into small pieces with back of fork, about 7 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage mixture to large bowl and cool.  Mix in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder, then cream cheese.  Season filling with salt and pepper; mix in egg yolk.

Brush 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish with olive oil to coat.  Brush cavity of each mushroom cap with white wine; fill with scant 1 tablespoon filling and sprinkle with some of remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  Arrange mushrooms, filling-side up, in prepared dish.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake uncovered until mushrooms are tender and filling is brown on top, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 24 mushrooms.

Comments:  "Cooking with friends -- that's pretty much what my life has been about," writes Louise Pickerel of Muskogee, Oklahoma.  "When I moved here from Texas ten years ago, it was hard to leave the people I'd known for so long, but I've probably met two hundred new people since then.  I have always entertained, but now that I'm retired, I finally have more time to play bridge and cook."

Perfect for Thanksgiving, these warm hors d'oeuvres can be assembled a day ahead and chilled, then baked before serving.

  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  12             large  sea scallops
                        Salt -- to taste

Comments:  Couscous with fresh herbs, and steamed green beans sprinkled with toasted pine nuts would be lovely accompaniments.  Dessert?  Try warm apple turnovers from the bakery; top with ice cream.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  large mushrooms -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2             pounds  ground lamb
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  2           packages  brown gravy seasoning mix - (0.87 oz ea)
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  frozen peas
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Buttery Mashed Potatoes -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and onion and sautÈ until mushrooms are brown, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer mushroom mixture to bowl.

Transfer lamb mixture to 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spoon Buttery Mashed Potatoes over, covering completely.  Bake pie until heated through, about 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "When I was 18, I left my home in Los Angeles to study medieval literature at St. Andrews University in Scotland," writes Scott Kleinman of Los Angeles, California.  "Since the university didn't feed us on the weekends, I was forced to feed myself.  And over time, cooking evolved from a chore into an enjoyable interest.  Today I'm back in Los Angeles as a professor of medieval English literature at Cal State Northridge.  I miss Great Britain quite a bit, but I keep in touch by reading British papers and tuning in to the BBC via the Internet.  And, of course, I still cook old favorites from my university days."

Scott perfected this in Scotland.  His secret to great flavor is freshly ground black pepper.

Comments:  &quot;When I was 18, I left my home in Los Angeles to study medieval literature at St. Andrews University in Scotland,&quot; writes Scott Kleinman of Los Angeles, California.  &quot;Since the university didn&apos;t feed us on the weekends, I was forced to feed myself.  And over time, cooking evolved from a chore into an enjoyable interest.  Today I&apos;m back in Los Angeles as a professor of medieval English literature at Cal State Northridge.  I miss Great Britain quite a bit, but I keep in touch by reading British papers and tuning in to the BBC via the Internet.  And, of course, I still cook old favorites from my university days.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scott perfected this in Scotland.  His secret to great flavor is freshly ground black pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/3           cups  sour cream
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- toasted, chopped
     1/4           cup  maple sugar -- plus
  1 1/3           cups  maple sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  13       tablespoons  butter -- room temperature,
                        and cut into pieces
  2              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === GLAZE ===
  1 1/3           cups  powdered sugar
  3        tablespoons  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  pure maple syrup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter Bundt pan, then spray with nonstick spray.

Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl.  Whisk sour cream and maple syrup in another medium bowl.  Mix walnuts, 1/4 cup maple sugar, and cinnamon in small bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat butter and remaining 1 1/3 cups maple sugar in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually beat in eggs and vanilla, occasionally stopping to scrape down sides of bowl.  Add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with sour cream mixture in 2 additions.  Transfer 2/3 of batter to prepared Bundt pan.  Sprinkle with walnut mixture.  Pour remaining batter into pan.

Bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.  Cool 20 minutes.  Turn out cake onto rack; cool completely.

For Glaze:  Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Let stand until thickened, about 30 minutes.  Pour glaze over cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep at room temperature.)

Serve cake with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  A wonderfully homey cake that's equally good with afternoon tea, after a meal, or for breakfast with a cup of Italian roast coffee.  Maple sugar is available at some supermarkets and at many natural foods stores.

                  Southwest Corn, Chili, And Cumin Saute

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  poblano chilies - (abt 9 oz total)
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cumin seeds
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  2                     bags frozen mixed white and
                        yellow corn kernels - (16 oz ea)
                        = (or one 16-oz bag each yellow and
                        white corn kernels, thawed, drained)
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  chopped canned chipotle chilies -- or more to taste
  1                     large bunch radishes -- trimmed, and
                        sliced into rounds
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  grated lime peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lime wedges -- (optional)

Char poblano chilies directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides.  Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes.  Peel, seed, and coarsely chop chilies.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add cumin seeds and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add onion and sautÈ until almost tender, about 6 minutes.  Add corn, oregano, 1 teaspoon chipotle chilies, and poblano chilies and sautÈ until corn is heated through, about 5 minutes.  Stir in radishes, 1/2 cup cilantro, lime juice, and lime peel.  SautÈ until radishes are slightly softened but still retain their color, about 2 minutes.  Add more chipotle chilies by 1/2 teaspoonfuls, depending on spiciness desired.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro.  Garnish with lime wedges, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  The poblano chilies can be prepared one day ahead, and the vegetables can be chopped and sliced one day ahead and then refrigerated separately in resealable plastic bags.  Then the whole dish just requires a few minutes of cooking time before serving.

Fresh green chilies, often called pasillas, are sold at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Comments:  "When autumn comes to Chicago, I love going to Lucca's to enjoy a big bowl of pumpkin soup while sitting outside on the patio," writes Tom Cove of Chicago, Illinois.  "Can you get this terrific recipe?"

A medley of exotic spices plus coconut milk and banana add complexity and rich flavor.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Scented with grated orange peel and spices, this dish is a combination of classic holiday flavors.  You can make it a day ahead and reheat it on the stove top or in the microwave.

                Sweet Potato And Roasted Mushroom Stuffing

Recipe By     :Barbara Shinn and David Page
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dressing/Stuffing               Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  crimini mushrooms -- halved
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  cubed (1") peeled yams - (abt 2 1/4 lbs)
                        = (red-skinned sweet potatoes)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  diced red onion
     3/4           cup  diced celery
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2              small  bay leaves
  5                     green onions -- coarsely chopped
  6               cups  cubed (1") French bread with crusts
                        = (from a 1-lb loaf)
     3/4           cup  orange juice
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  low-salt chicken broth
  3              large  eggs -- beaten to blend

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss mushrooms and oil in medium bowl to coat; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Turn mushrooms out onto baking sheet and roast until golden, about 20 minutes; transfer to large bowl.

Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, about 6 minutes.  Drain potatoes; add to mushrooms.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add red onion and next 4 ingredients.  SautÈ 8 minutes.  Add green onions; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Discard bay leaves.  Add mixture to mushrooms.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Reheat to lukewarm before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Mix bread into vegetable mixture.  Whisk juice, milk, and broth in medium bowl to blend; mix into stuffing.  Season stuffing with salt and pepper; stir in eggs.  Transfer to prepared dish.  Bake uncovered until cooked through and brown, about 50 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  One of two stuffings (see also the "Apple and Sausage Stuffing") developed by Barbara Shinn and David Page of Home restaurant in New York.  This dish features large cubes of French bread and a custardy texture.  To ensure a crisply browned top, the stuffing should be baked separately from the turkey.

Comments:  One of two stuffings (see also the &quot;Apple and Sausage Stuffing&quot;) developed by Barbara Shinn and David Page of Home restaurant in New York.  This dish features large cubes of French bread and a custardy texture.  To ensure a crisply browned top, the stuffing should be baked separately from the turkey.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  whole almonds
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1              large  egg
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     yam - (abt 1 lb)
                        = (red-skinned sweet potato)
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  mini marshmallows
     1/2           cup  pecans -- toasted, chopped
                        Sweetened whipped cream -- for serving

For Crust:  Blend flour, almonds, and salt in processor until almonds are finely ground.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and powdered sugar in large bowl until fluffy.  Add egg and beat until just blended.  Add flour mixture in 2 additions, beating until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball.  Flatten into disk.  Chill until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.  Soften dough slightly before rolling out.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer dough to 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold in overhang, pressing to form double-thick sides.  Pierce bottom of crust all over with fork.  Chill crust at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bake crust until pale golden, about 25 minutes.  Transfer to rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roast yam on foil-lined baking sheet until very tender when pierced with skewer, about 45 minutes.  Halve yam lengthwise; cool completely.

Scoop 1 cup yam pulp into blender (reserve remaining pulp for another use).  Add sugar, cream, eggs, vanilla, spices, and salt and process until smooth.  Sprinkle marshmallows and pecans over prepared crust.  Pour batter over.

Bake tart until filling is set, about 35 minutes.  Transfer to rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)  Serve cold or at room temperature with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     red-skinned sweet potato [yam] - (1 lb) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     Granny Smith apple - (6 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" chunks
  2               cups  whole milk
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
  2          teaspoons  coarse salt
  1                cup  white cornmeal
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder

Cook sweet potato in pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain; transfer to large bowl.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add apple; sautÈ until tender and golden, about 8 minutes.  Add apple to sweet potato; mash together.  Cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bring milk, sugar, sage, and salt to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Reduce heat to medium-low; gradually whisk in cornmeal.  Cook until cornmeal absorbs milk and pulls clean from bottom of pan, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in 3 tablespoons butter.  Whisk yolks in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in warm cornmeal mixture.  Whisk in baking powder.  Mix sweet potato mixture into cornmeal mixture.  Beat egg whites in medium bowl to medium-stiff peaks.  Fold whites into warm cornmeal mixture.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat.  Pour batter into skillet.  Transfer skillet to oven; bake spoon bread until top is golden and puffed, about 1 hour.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This moist spoon bread (a pudding-like bread made with cornmeal) tastes best warm.

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     boneless whole turkey breast - (3 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/4           cups  low-salt chicken broth - (about)

Finely chop white part of onions.  Place green parts side by side on 15- by 10- by 1-inch heavy rimmed baking sheet to form mat.  Mix chopped onions, sausage, raisins, 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl.

Place turkey on work surface, skin-side down.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Spoon sausage mixture in row between breast halves.  Starting at 1 long side, roll up turkey breast to enclose filling.  Tie with kitchen string at 1-inch intervals to hold shape.  Place turkey atop onion mat.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush oil all over turkey.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and 2 teaspoons fennel.  Roast until thermometer inserted into filling registers 155 degrees, basting turkey every 15 minutes with 1/4 cup broth and adding more broth to pan if drippings burn, about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Transfer to platter; let stand 5 minutes.

Set baking sheet with onions atop 2 burners.  Add 1 cup broth to baking sheet.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat, scraping up browned bits.  Boil 2 minutes.  Strain pan juices into medium bowl; discard solids.  Serve turkey with pan juices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  No carving required: Have the butcher bone the turkey breast, leaving the breast halves attached; then just slice at the table before serving.  In addition to the sweet potatoes and cranberries, serve buttered green beans and bread alongside the turkey.  Pour Chardonnay or Zinfandel, and finish off with the classic pumpkin pie.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     russet potatoes - (12 oz ea) -- scrubbed
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Havarti cheese - -- (abt 4 oz)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced shallots - (abt 8 oz)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Pierce potatoes in several places with fork, then brush lightly with oil.  Place potatoes directly on oven rack and bake until tender when pierced with fork, about 55 minutes.  Cool potatoes slightly.

Cut off thin slice from both short ends of each potato and discard.  Cut each potato crosswise in half; stand each half on its small flat end.  Using teaspoon, scoop out cooked potato pulp from each half, leaving 1/3-inch-thick shell and forming potato cup.  Place potato cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Place potato pulp in medium bowl; add cheese, sour cream, milk, and cayenne.  Using potato masher or fork, mash until well blended and almost smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Mound mashed potato mixture in potato cups.

Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until tender and deep brown, about 12 minutes.  Top potato cups with shallots.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake potato cups until heated through, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  These small potato cups (each one is half a russet potato) are a great choice if you're short on oven space.  The potatoes can be baked and stuffed one day ahead and chilled, then warmed in the oven for 20 minutes while the turkey rests before carving.

Comments:  "Cooking with friends -- that's pretty much what my life has been about," writes Louise Pickerel of Muskogee, Oklahoma.  "When I moved here from Texas ten years ago, it was hard to leave the people I'd known for so long, but I've probably met two hundred new people since then.  I have always entertained, but now that I'm retired, I finally have more time to play bridge and cook."

Louise likes to serve this chunky soup with ham or roast beef sandwich wraps.

       Waldorf Salad With Cranberries And Pecans In Radicchio Cups

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     Granny Smith apples - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- unpeeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  chopped celery
  1 1/2           cups  chopped radishes
     3/4           cup  dried cranberries
     1/2           cup  finely chopped red onion
  2               cups  watercress leaves
  1 1/2           cups  pecans -- toasted, chopped
  2                     radicchio heads -- leaves separated

Mix mayonnaise, lemon peel, and fresh lemon juice in medium bowl to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate 15 minutes.

Toss apples, celery, radishes, cranberries, and red onion in large bowl.  Add lemon mayonnaise and toss to coat.  (Can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Fold watercress and pecans into salad.  Arrange 2 radicchio leaves on each plate.  Spoon salad into center of radicchio leaves and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This updated classic adds dashes of red -- and depth of flavor -- to the usual apple, celery, and walnut mix.  Make the salad ahead and refrigerate, then add the watercress and pecans right before serving.

              Warm Endive Salad With Parmesan And Hazelnuts

Recipe By     :Mark Van Wye, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely chopped
  4              large  Belgian endive heads -- halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  low-salt chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  white wine vinegar
  8        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - -- (abt 2 oz)
                        Chopped toasted hazelnuts -- for garnish
                        Chopped fresh chives -- for garnish

Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and stir 30 seconds.  Add endive, cut-side down.  Add wine and broth and bring to boil.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.

Using tongs, turn endive over.  Cover and cook until crisp-tender, about 1 minute longer.  Remove skillet from heat.

Using tongs, lift endive from skillet, draining liquid from each back into skillet, and transfer 2 halves, cut-side up, to each of 4 plates.

Add vinegar to skillet; cook over medium heat until sauce reduces slightly, about 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt and pepper; spoon over endive.  Sprinkle each salad with 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, then hazelnuts and chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "For me, cooking has always been a way to wind down and relax," writes Mark Van Wye of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  "I'm a writer and I work from home, so depending on how busy things are, I can spend hours preparing a meal.  But I also like to be ready to whip up dinner at the drop of a hat.  The recipe here is just one of a handful of standbys I rely on when last-minute company is coming or a deadline has kept me out of the kitchen."

This sophisticated starter would lend an elegant touch to any special meal.

           Warm Milk Chocolate Souffles With Vanilla Ice Cream

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14            ounces  good-quality milk chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Ghirardelli)
     3/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut small cubes
  6              large  egg yolks
  2              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  sugar
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter eight 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes.  Coat soufflÈ dishes with sugar.  Arrange soufflÈ dishes on heavy large baking sheet.

Stir milk chocolate and butter in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until chocolate mixture is melted and smooth (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Cool chocolate mixture to lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks, whole eggs, and sugar in large bowl until pale, thick, and tripled in volume, about 6 minutes.  Fold 1/3 of egg mixture into lukewarm chocolate mixture to lighten.  Gently fold chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture.  Spoon into prepared dishes, dividing equally.  Smooth tops.

Bake until soufflÈs rise and edges are crisp and dark brown but centers are still soft, about 25 minutes.  Dust tops with powdered sugar.  Transfer to plates.  Serve immediately, passing ice cream separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Jacqueline Willis of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, writes: "Recently I had a superb chocolate soufflÈ at the Ercole Ristorante Italiano in Calgary.  It was made with milk chocolate -- a subtle but delicious variation.  I would love to be able to re-create it for friends at home. "

The restaurant calls this dessert a warm chocolate mousse, but it reminds us of soufflÈ.  These may collapse quickly after coming out of the oven, so wait until each person has been served before topping with ice cream.
