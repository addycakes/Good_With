          Angel Hair Pasta With Fresh Tomato, Basil, And Garlic

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATO BASE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2          teaspoons  chopped shallots
  4               cups  tomato concasse -- see * Note
                        = (made with 2 lbs whole tomatoes)
  1         tablespoon  sugar or honey -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  5             ounces  Double-Blanched Garlic -- (see recipe), sliced
  2               cups  tomato concasse
                        = (made with 1 lb whole tomatoes)
  2               cups  Tomato Base
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === PASTA ===
  12            ounces  fresh or store-bought angel hair pasta
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
  1             Sprigs  fresh basil leaves -- for garnish
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

* Note:  Tomato concasse is nothing more than peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes.  To peel, remove the core of the tomato, score the bottom with an X, and carefully slide into a pan of simmering water to cover.  When the skin just begins to peel away (which could take as little as 10 seconds, depending upon the ripeness of the tomato), remove the tomato with a slotted spoon and immediately refresh it in iced water.  Peel away the outer skin, cut the tomato in half across the middle, and squeeze each half to remove the seeds.  Then, coarsely chop the tomato with a heavy knife.

Make a Tomato Base:  In a 12-inch skillet, over medium high heat, heat the olive oil.  SautÈ the garlic and shallots just until they start to color.  Add the 4 cups of tomato concasse, sugar, if necessary, and salt and cook over medium heat until reduced by half, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the tomato paste and chopped thyme and set aside.  (Tomato Base can be made in large quantities and frozen up for to 3 months to be used to improve sauces made with tomatoes.  This recipe makes about 2 cups.)

Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil.

Make the Sauce:  In a clean 12-inch skillet or sautÈ pan over medium high heat, heat the olive oil.  SautÈ the garlic, stirring often, until it is lightly golden in color, about 2 minutes.

Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the 2 cups of tomato concasse, the reserved 2 cups of Tomato Base, the 1/4 cup chopped basil, and the salt.  Return the skillet to the heat and simmer over medium-high heat until some of the moisture from the tomatoes evaporates, 3 to 4 minutes.

When ready to serve, add pasta to the pot of boiling water and cook until it is al dente, about 1 minute for fresh pasta (cook packaged pasta according to the directions on the box).  Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce with the chopped fresh parsley.  Gently stir to heat through and coat the pasta with sauce.

To serve, divide the pasta and sauce evenly, twirl with kitchen tongs or a fork and place on 4 large, warm plates or bowls.  Garnish with basil sprigs and grated Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The simplest of all pasta and sauce dishes, this one has a special richness which results from the tomato base.  When tomatoes are out of season and not as sweet as they should be, a pinch of sugar or a little honey will increase the flavor.  Olives, capers, dried tomatoes, and chili peppers can also be added if desired.

Wine Recommendation:  I like Chianti.  Forget those raffia-covered bottles of the past, Chianti now boasts some of Italy's greatest wines.  But you have to be careful.  Look for names like Antinori, Altesino, Villa Cafaggio, Fontodi, Terrabianca, E. Ricasoli-Firidolfi and Castello di Querceto.  Or ask your friendly wine shop proprietor for advice if the labels all seem too complicated.

  2                     recipes Wolfgang's Favorite Tomato
                        Sauce For Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  fresh or packaged angel hair pasta
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/2           cup  julienned basil
     1/2           cup  chiffonaded basil

Heat the double recipe of Wolfgang's Favorite Tomato Sauce for Pasta in a large saucepan over medium high heat until almost boiling.

Add the fresh julienned basil to the sauce and stir.

Fill a large saucepan with 4 quarts water.  Add salt and bring to the boil.  Add pasta.  For fresh pasta, cook for 1 to 2 minutes, tasting to make sure it's al dente (firm to the bite) before removing into a sieve or fine colander.  Stir into the sauce.

Cook the sauce and pasta together for 1 minute before serving.

Divide the pasta into four equal portions and, using a pair of tongs or a carving fork, twirl into a mound and position in the center of each plate.  Top with remaining sauce from pan.  Garnish with freshly chiffonaded basil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a pasta dish served with the classic "red" sauce, a combination of tomato, basil and garlic.  With this simple dish the presentation is very important and helps to make it special.

       Angel Hair With Goat Cheese, Broccoli, And Toasted Pine Nuts

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  broccoli florets
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  homemade Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme or basil leaves -- plus
  4                     fresh thyme or basil sprigs - (to 6) -- for garnish
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  12            ounces  fresh or store bought angel hair pasta
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted

Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil.

In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat the tablespoon of olive oil.  SautÈ the broccoli florets, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Deglaze the pan with the Chicken Stock, and add the thyme or basil leaves.  Bring to a boil and reduce by half.  Add the butter and the goat cheese and stir together until the cheese melts.  Stir in the broccoli.  Keep warm.

Cook the angel hair pasta in the boiling salted water until it is al dente, about 1 minute for fresh pasta.  (Cook dry pasta according to the package directions.)  Drain the pasta well and add to the sauce and broccoli in the skillet.  Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, until heated through.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

To toast pine nuts, place the nuts in a small skillet in a single layer.  Over low heat, toast for about 3 to 4 minutes until lightly golden, stirring often to prevent burning.

Twirl the pasta and sauce with kitchen tongs or a fork and mound onto 4 heated plates.  Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts and garnish with a sprig of thyme.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This was the first pasta dish we put on the menu at Spago in 1982.  In those days we didn't even have a pasta machine -- we cut all of the noodles by hand.  Some days they looked like delicate angel hair and some days they turned out like fettuccine.  But in the end, people didn't care about the shape as much as the taste.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a good Californian Chardonnay with lots of depth to match the goat cheese in this pasta.  Liberty School, Chateau Souverain and Napa Ridge all make wonderful rich Chardonnays, a notch above most reasonably-priced Californians.

Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat the tablespoon of olive oil.  SautÈ the broccoli florets, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deglaze the pan with the Chicken Stock, and add the thyme or basil leaves.  Bring to a boil and reduce by half.  Add the butter and the goat cheese and stir together until the cheese melts.  Stir in the broccoli.  Keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the angel hair pasta in the boiling salted water until it is al dente, about 1 minute for fresh pasta.  (Cook dry pasta according to the package directions.)  Drain the pasta well and add to the sauce and broccoli in the skillet.  Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, until heated through.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To toast pine nuts, place the nuts in a small skillet in a single layer.  Over low heat, toast for about 3 to 4 minutes until lightly golden, stirring often to prevent burning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Twirl the pasta and sauce with kitchen tongs or a fork and mound onto 4 heated plates.  Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts and garnish with a sprig of thyme.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  This was the first pasta dish we put on the menu at Spago in 1982.  In those days we didn&apos;t even have a pasta machine -- we cut all of the noodles by hand.  Some days they looked like delicate angel hair and some days they turned out like fettuccine.  But in the end, people didn&apos;t care about the shape as much as the taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  I like a good Californian Chardonnay with lots of depth to match the goat cheese in this pasta.  Liberty School, Chateau Souverain and Napa Ridge all make wonderful rich Chardonnays, a notch above most reasonably-priced Californians.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STRUDEL DOUGH ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6             ounces  water -- warm
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        === STRUDEL FILLING ===
  8                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced feather thin
     1/2           cup  lemon juice - (2 lemons)
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cinnamon
  1                cup  raisins
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  8        tablespoons  melted butter -- for spraying and
                        brushing

Directions for dough in a food processor:  Place all the ingredients in the fitted bowl with blade attachments of the food processor.  Pulse until the mixture forms a ball.  Continue mixing for two minutes.  Remove dough from bowl.  Coat dough with one tablespoon vegetable oil.  Wrap airtight with plastic wrap. Allow to rest in a warm 70 degree area for 20 minutes.

Directions for dough by hand:  In a medium mixing bowl, sift in the flours and the salt.  Create a well in the center of the flour.  In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil and water.  Pour liquid into center of well.  With a fork, work the flour into the center of the well.  Turn the bowl while you are doing this.  Once dough comes together, knead on the table.  Continue kneading for 10 minutes.  Yes, 10 minutes!  Coat outside of dough with one tablespoon vegetable oil and cover with plastic wrap.  Reserve in a warm environment for 20 minutes.  Remove plastic wrap.

Directions for whole strudel:  In a medium bowl, toss together the apples and lemon juice.  In a small bowl, combine the sugar and the cinnamon.  Add the sugar and raisins to the apples.  Reserve.

Place dough on flour dusted tablecloth.  With a rolling pin, roll dough to 12-inch by 12-inch square.  Now, here is the fun part.  Lift the dough from the table and work with the back of hands.  Constantly move hands, pulling back until the dough stretches to the size of the table.

Spray dough with butter.  Spread bread crumbs in a two-inch line -- four inches from the bottom of the dough.  Place the prepared apples on the line of bread crumbs and roll up.  With a knife, trim ends and tuck end of dough.  Spray or brush dough with melted butter.

Bake in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Spray with butter again and turn sheet pan around.  Continue to bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Wolfgang's pastry chef, Sherry Yard, is the one who dreams up all those incredible desserts for the star-studded Oscar parties and for his Spago restaurant.  But you can get a taste without a reservation.  Try their fabulous apple strudel above.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  melted butter
     2/3           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter -- for frying pan
                        === APRICOT COMPOTE ===
  1              pound  apricots - (abt 6 med) -- sliced into eighths
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4        tablespoons  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

For Crepes:  In a small stainless steel mixing bowl, whisk together the ingredients in the order given above, creating a smooth batter.  Put the batter through a strainer to get rid of any lumps, cover it with plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for one hour.  If you prefer, you can prepare the batter the day before you plan to make your crepes.

Remove the batter from the refrigerator and stir.  Brush a 12-inch nonstick frying pan with butter and put it on a low to medium heat.  Ladle approximately 1 ounce of the batter into the pan, twirling by hand in a circular motion to create a very thin crepe.  Cook crepe until golden, approximately 1 minute on each side.

For Apricot Compote:  In a medium saucepan, combine orange juice, lemon juice, sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.  Bring to a boil.  Add all of the sliced apricots and cook for to 3 minutes.

Presentation:  Put 2 tablespoons of the apricot preserves into a crepe.  Roll the crepe or fold it in half twice to make a quarter.  Dust the crepe with powdered sugar.

This recipe yields (24 crepes) 8 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Palatschinken translates as "pancakes with filling."

Peel the asparagus.  In a large pot, bring heavily salted water to a boil.  Place asparagus in the water and cook until tender but still firm (about 5 minutes from the time the water returns to a boil).  Remove the asparagus from the pot and refresh in ice water to stop the cooking process.

With a wire whisk, combine all the ingredients except the oil.  Slowly, in a steady stream, add the oil, continuing to whisk all the while.

Arrange asparagus on individual plates and spoon over the dressing.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                            Basic Pasta Dough

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  8              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  water -- more or less
                        Semolina or all-purpose flour -- for dusting

In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 3 tablespoons of the water.  Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it.  If it is too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball.  Turn out onto a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed.  Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes to 1 hour.

Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out one piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness.

If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening.  Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers.  If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour.  Run the pasta through the machine.  Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again.  Repeat this procedure two more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic.

Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers.  Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary.  (The strip of dough will be long.  If you don't have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered.)

Adjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking.  A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour.  As one layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour.  Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes.

Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 pounds, 6 to 8 servings

Comments:  Making pasta can be fun, and it is easy to involve the whole family in the preparation.  The dough can be made with half semolina and half all-purpose flour, which will give you a firmer dough.  This is a very basic recipe which can be used for fettuccine, lasagna, ravioli, or any other pasta shape you choose.  Follow the instructions that come with your pasta machine for the best results.

           Beef Rouladen With Brunoise Vegetables And Red Wine

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  bottom round -- trimmed
  3                     yellow onions -- diced small
  3              large  carrots -- peeled, diced
  3                     celery stalks -- diced small
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1              pound  ground chicken
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry bread crumbs
  1                     egg -- beaten
  4                     dill pickles
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              bunch  parsley -- chopped
  3               cups  red wine
  1                cup  port wine
                        Fresh thyme -- to taste
  1                cup  veal stock
  2               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  butter

Flatten the beef round with a cleaver, or meat pounder to 1/4-inch thick, butterfly if necessary.  Mix the vegetables together with the garlic.  Take half of the diced vegetables and mix with the ground chicken.  Season with the salt and pepper, bread crumbs and egg.  Mix thoroughly.

Season the beef with salt and pepper.  Spread the chicken farce on 1 side of the flattened bottom round and add the pickles lengthwise, directly down the middle of the meat.  Carefully roll the beef into a tight roll, being sure not to press too hard or squeeze the chicken farce out of the sides.

Season the outside of the beef roulade with salt and pepper.  Tie with butchers string in 5 or 6 sections along the length of the roll.  Tie them fairly tight, because when the beef cooks it will shrink and the string will fall off.

Sear the beef in a smoking hot sautÈ pan in olive oil until all sides are a dark brown color.  Remove from the pan and keep in a warm place.

In the same pan, add the other half of the vegetables and cook for 3 minutes, when the vegetables are golden brown deglaze with wines and add the fresh thyme.  Bring this mixture to a boil and add the beef and reduce the heat.  Cover with either the lid or foil and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove the foil and add the veal stock and Chicken Stock.

Bring to a boil and turn the meat, so that the other side of the meat is in the liquid.  Cook for 10 more minutes on a medium flame.  Cook this mixture until the internal temperature reads 165 degrees.  The chicken must read 165 degrees or you risk the chance of possible bacteria.  If too much of the liquid evaporates add a little more chicken stock.

Remove the meat from the pan and let rest for 10 minutes prior to slicing.  Remove the string from the beef with a small knife.  Slice the beef into 1/2-inch portions and transfer to a serving platter.  Add butter to the vegetable mixture and swirl to melt.  Spoon the vegetable mixture over the meat and serve with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 24    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Beef


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  trimmed New York filet steak
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  chili flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
                        === SZECHWAN SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3 oz)
  2                     garlic cloves -- blanched, and
                        chopped fine - (abt 1 tbspn)
  1                     green onion -- chopped fine
  1                cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili flakes

Cut the steak into 24 (3- by 1-inch) strips, each weighing about 1/2 ounce.  Using 24 (6-inch) bamboo skewers, stick a skewer into each strip lengthwise and arrange on a large platter or baking pan.  Refrigerate until needed.

Prepare the marinade:  In a small bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients and pour over the meat, turning to coat all sides.  Let marinate, un-refrigerated, about 15 minutes.

Preheat the grill or broiler while the steak is marinating.

Prepare the sauce:  In a small skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter.  Add the garlic and green onion and sautÈ over medium-high until soft, about 2 minutes.  pour in the stock, soy sauce, and chili pepper flakes, and cook 1 or 2 minutes longer.  Strain into a clean pan and whisk in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter.  Keep warm.

Arrange the skewers of steak on the grill or under the broiler (bring your broiler tray directly under the flame for best results) being careful that the bare ends of the skewers are not directly over (or under) the flame.  Grill until medium-rare, about 30 to 40 seconds on each side.

Presentation:  Pour the sauce into a small bowl and set in the center of a large serving platter.  Arrange the skewers around the bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 24 skewers.

                           Black Pepper Scones

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  13       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (6 1/2 oz) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  1 1/2    tablespoons  medium-grind black pepper
  2 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped lemon peel
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream -- for brushing

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Using two knives or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Gently stir in the pepper and lemon peel.  Add the 1 1/2 cups cream all at once and mix until the dough just comes together.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough into a ball.  For a flakier consistency, do not knead the dough into a smooth ball.  If smooth, the scone will be more cakelike.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight.

Cut the dough into three equal pieces.  Working with one piece at a time, keeping the other two pieces covered, roll out to a circle, 6 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick.  Cut the circle into 6 wedges and arrange the wedges on one or two baking trays lined with parchment paper.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

The scones can be cut out with a 2 1/2 inch cookie cutter if desired.  Roll out the dough, cut, and place on a baking tray.  Reroll the dough and continue cutting out circles. Proceed as in step 5.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly brush the scones with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cream and bake until golden, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Serve warm with butter, and jam if you like it.

This recipe yields 18 scones.

Comments:  I love the flavor of fresh black pepper in scones.  But, if you prefer, 1 cup of dried blueberries, sour cherries or raisins can be used instead of the pepper to make a fruitier, sweeter scone.

        Bow Ties With Spring Vegetables, Roasted Garlic, Parmesan

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  flavored oil from Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  Roasted Whole Garlic -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  haricots verts or green beans -- trimmed
  1                     carrot -- trimmed, and
                        cut into thin slices
  12                    pencil asparagus -- cut 2" slices
  1                cup  broccoli florets
     1/2           cup  fresh peas
  12            ounces  bow tie pasta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil.

In a large skillet or sautÈ pan, heat the flavored oil.  Add the roasted garlic, butter, tomatoes, and stock.  Season with the oregano, thyme, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, salt, and pepper, and reduce until slightly thickened.

Meanwhile, blanch all the vegetables, each type individually, in simmering salted water, about 1 minute.  Refresh in cold water, drain well, and set aside.

When the sauce has been reduced, add the vegetables and stir to heat through.

Add salt to the pot of boiling water and cook the bow ties until they are al dente, following the directions on the package.  Drain the pasta and stir it into the sauce, coating well.  Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the grated cheese.

To serve, divide the pasta and vegetables among 4 large warm plates or bowls.  Sprinkle each serving with some of the remaining chopped parsley and serve immediately.

Additional Parmesan cheese can be grated onto the dish after serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I love pasta all year round and this is one of my favorites.  Use the freshest seasonal vegetables you can find and be sure not to overcook them.  The secret is to keep the vegetables crisp so they crunch when you bite into them.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for the freshness of a Sauvignon Blanc from Sancere or New Zealand to accompany this pasta.  Goldwater's Dog Point or Villa Maria are both excellent and affordable wines that are perfect accompaniments.

     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  1             medium  red onion -- sliced
  1                cup  brown sugar
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- cored, sliced

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chestnuts
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                cup  port wine
                        Thyme -- to taste
  3               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a heavy saucepan.  Add the oil, butter, and chopped unions.  When onions turn slightly brown, deglaze with port wine.  Add thyme, chestnuts, chicken stock, and a little salt and pepper.  Cover and cook until chestnuts are tender and the chestnuts have absorbed most of the liquid.

Serve as whole braised chestnuts or pass through a ricer and make a wonderful chestnut purÈe.

                     Braised Veal With Red Wine Sauce

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  assorted dried fruits
                        = (prunes, apricots, figs)
  1             bottle  port - (abt 3 1/2 cups)
  4             pounds  veal shank meat
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  brunoise of onion
     1/2           cup  brunoise of carrot
     1/2           cup  brunoise of celery
  1                cup  blanched whole almonds
  1             bottle  dry red wine - (abt 3 1/2 cups)
  2               cups  Brown Veal Stock - (to 4) -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Couscous -- (see recipe)

In a small bowl, marinate the dried fruit, with enough port to cover, overnight.

Remove the meat from the veal shankbones.  Dust the meat with flour.  (The simplest way is to pour the flour into a bag and, one by one, place the meat in the bag, coat with the flour, and shake off the excess.)  Season lightly with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large ovenproof roasting pan, heat the olive oil.  Brown the shanks on all sides.  Do not crowd the pan, browning in batches if necessary.  Add the vegetables, almonds, dried fruit and the marinating liquid.  Pour in the remaining port and the red wine and bring to a boil.  Turn the flame to medium and reduce the sauce by half.  (The length of time required depends upon the size of the pan.)

Pour in enough Brown Veal Stock to cover the shanks and bring to a boil.  Cover the pan, transfer to the oven, and cook until the shanks are tender, 35 to 45 minutes.  Remove the shanks and keep warm.  Reduce the sauce just until it thickens.  Correct seasoning to taste and return the shanks to the pan.

Presentation:  Mound the Couscous in the center of each of 8 heated plates.  Top with one veal shank and spoon the sauce over, including some almonds and fruit.  Serve immediately.  Have small forks on hand to scoop out the marrow from the bones.  (May be prepared ahead, reheating over a low flame when ready to serve.  If the sauce thickens too much, thin with a little more stock.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  I favor braising for the cuts of meat that usually take a longer time to cook.  Braising keeps the meat moist and results in a delicious sauce without the use of cream or butter.   This dish can be made the day before, cooled and reheated as needed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  veal bones -- cut 2" chunks
                        = (or veal and beef bones) -- see * Note
  2             medium  onions -- coarsely chopped
  2             medium  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1                     leek -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  tomatoes -- quartered,
                        = (or 1/2 cup tomato paste)
  1           teaspoon  whole peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  8                     garlic cloves -- (optional), smashed

* Note:  If you want to make lamb stock, substitute lamb bones for the veal and beef bones and continue with the recipe.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Arrange the bones in a roasting pan large enough to hold them in a single layer.  Roast in the oven until dark golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours, turning to brown all sides.  After one hour, add the remaining ingredients to brown.  Transfer the bones and vegetables to a large stockpot, 10- to 12-quarts.

Pour off the fat from the roasting pan and deglaze the pan with 2 cups of water, scraping up any particles that stick to the bottom of the pan.  Pour into the stockpot with enough additional water to cover the ingredients by 3 inches.  Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, 4 to 6 hours, skimming the foam as it accumulates on top, and adding water as needed to keep the bones and vegetables covered at all times.

Strain the liquid into a clean pot, pressing down to extract all the juices.  Reduce, over medium heat, until 2 quarts remain.  (To make demi-glace, reduce the liquid until 1 quart remains.)

Cool and refrigerate in a covered container up to 3 days, discarding any hardened layer of fat before using or freezing.  The stock can be frozen in small quantities and used as needed.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  Great with "Braised Veal With Red Wine Sauce" (see recipe).

Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (5 oz) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/4           cup  minced onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 2 tspns dried thyme)
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  milk or cream - (to 2)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.  Add the butter, onion, and thyme, and process until the mixture resembles fine meal.  With the machine running, pour the buttermilk through the feed tube, just until the dough comes together.

Turn out onto a well-floured work surface and knead lightly into a round ball.  Roll out the dough to about 1-inch thickness, and with a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out as many biscuits as you can.  Repeat this procedure until you have used all the dough, giving you 20 to 22 biscuits.  Arrange the biscuits, as cut, on two parchment-lined baking trays.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brush the top of each biscuit with milk or cream and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese, if desired.  Bake 25 to 35 minutes, until lightly golden.  Serve warm.

Delicious by themselves, these biscuits are great with soup or served with butter and honey, or your favorite preserves.

This recipe yields 20 to 22 biscuits.

Comments:  These are wonderful, fluffy, biscuits, crusty on the outside and light and buttery inside.  To this basic recipe you may want to add some finely chopped jalapeÒo or toasted sesame seeds.  Plumped raisins can also be added, eliminating the Parmesan cheese and minced onion.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2                pate sucre
  4              whole  eggs
  4                     egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar -- plus

  6             ounces  soft butter -- cut small pieces

Roll out the pate sucre to a circle to about 1/4-inch thick and large enough to slightly cover a 9-inch metal tart pan.  Fit the dough into the pan and trim the edges.  Line the bottom and sides of the shell with parchment.  Fill the lining with dried beans or rice and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool and remove the beans and lining.  Return the shell to the oven and bake until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes longer.

In a large metal bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, 1 cup sugar, lemon and lime juice, and zests.  Set over simmering water and continue to whisk until the mixture is very thick, about 10 minutes.

Turn off the flame and whisk in the butter, a few pieces at a time.  (You don't want the mixture to cool down before all the butter is incorporated).  Strain the filling into a bowl.  Scrape into the baked tart shell and smooth with a metal spatula.  Cool and then refrigerate until firm, 3 to 4 hours, up to overnight.

Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar evenly over the top of the filling.  With a propane blowtorch, caramelize the sugar.  (This can be done under the broiler, being careful not to burn the sugar topping).  Refrigerate the tart for at least 30 minutes.  Or if desired, eliminate the 2 tablespoons of sugar and arrange circles of raspberries on top of the tart.  Sift a little powdered sugar over the berries just before serving.

Cut into slices and serve with an assortment of fresh berries.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Whenever Whoopi Goldberg or Dabney Coleman comes to our restaurant, we know that we have to reserve a quarter of this tart for each of them.  Dabney likes it with ice-cold milk, but Whoopi just eats it alone.

Wine Recommendation:  A dessert wine such as a Bonny Doon, Framboise for Santa Cruz works great.  Also port such as Warre's Warrior or even a nice sparkling California white can be used.

                    Cheesecake With Caramelized Apples

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3        recipe  Sugar Dough -- (see recipe)
  1              large  Granny Smith or Pippin apple
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  plus 3 tablespoons sugar
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
  2             medium  lemons
  9             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

On a floured surface, roll the pastry 1/4-inch thick.  Using the base of a 9-inch springform pan as a guide, cut a 9-inch circle and fit it into the bottom of the pan.  Prick the dough with a fork to prevent it from rising, then bake it for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is just golden.  Remove from oven and let cool.

Peel, halve and core the apple and cut it into 1/4-inch slices.  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium high heat and sautÈ the apple slices with 3 tablespoons sugar.  Cook for about 5 minutes or until the apple is lightly caramelized but still tender.  Add the cream and cook until it has been absorbed.  Remove from the heat and reserve.

Finely grate the zest from the lemons and reserve.  Juice the lemons to render 6 tablespoons juice and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.  Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, then add 1 cup of the sour cream, lemon juice and lemon zest.

Arrange the caramelized apple slices over the bottom of the crust in a single layer.  Pour the cheese mixture over the apples.  Tap the pan gently against the counter to settle the batter.

Bake the cake for about 20 minutes.  The cake is done when the sides are set but the center moves slightly when the pan is shaken gently.  There should not be any cracks in the top.

Stir the remaining 1/2 cup sour cream until it is quite liquid.  Drizzle it over the top of the hot cheesecake and spread it as evenly and smoothly as possible.  Let cool to room temperature, then chill the cake for several hours, up to overnight.

Remove the cheesecake from the pan.  Cut the wedges and serve immediately.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cheesecake; 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This is a different, delicious variation on a traditional cheesecake.  It makes a light, satisfying end to a summer meal.

Wine Recommendation:  I usually like to drink Port with cheesecake, but with this lighter version I turn to something like a Californian Viognier.  The apple and apricot taste notes you find in Viogniers from vineyards like Bonterra and Rutherford provide a wonderful harmony.

                      Chino Chopped Vegetable Salad

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  almond or safflower oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground while pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced fresh artichoke hearts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground while pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  diced carrots
     1/2           cup  diced green beans
     1/2           cup  diced red onion
     1/2           cup  diced radicchio
     1/2           cup  fresh corn kernels
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  diced ripe avocado
     1/4           cup  chopped peeled seeded tomato
  4          teaspoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1                cup  bite-size mixed greens of your choice
                        = (curly endive, chicory, baby lettuce)

Prepare the vinaigrette:  In a small bowl, combine the mustard and vinegar.  Slowly whisk in the oils.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.  Whisk again when ready to serve.

Prepare the salad:  In a small skillet, heat the olive oil.  Season the diced artichokes lightly with salt and pepper and sautÈ until al dente, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl and let cool.

Blanch the carrots and beans by placing in a wire sieve.  Set the sieve into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes.  Plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process.  Drain, cool, and add to the artichokes.  Add the onion, radicchio, corn, and celery.

When ready to serve, dice the avocado and the tomato and add to the other vegetables with the vinaigrette, sprinkle with the grated cheese, and toss again.  Correct seasoning to taste.

Toss the greens with the reserved vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Divide the salad greens among 4 salad plates.  Mound the chopped salad on the greens and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  No one I know grows better vegetables than the Chino family on their farm in Rancho Santa Fe.  If you live in Southern California it's worth a trip just to see them growing in their fields.  If you live further afield, shop carefully at your local farmer's market.  What tastes better on a hot summer day than a fresh vegetable salad!

Wine Recommendation:  Itís always a challenge to find a wine that can match the acidic power of a good vinaigrette but I find that some of the really rounded and rich Californian Chardonnays can taste surprisingly good with a salad like this.  Estancia, Woodbridge (from Robert Mondavi) and Beringer Chardonnays are all readily available and represent great value.  Donít be surprised if you find something you really like at your wine store for around $10!

Prepare the vinaigrette:  In a small bowl, combine the mustard and vinegar.  Slowly whisk in the oils.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.  Whisk again when ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the salad:  In a small skillet, heat the olive oil.  Season the diced artichokes lightly with salt and pepper and sautÈ until al dente, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Blanch the carrots and beans by placing in a wire sieve.  Set the sieve into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes.  Plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process.  Drain, cool, and add to the artichokes.  Add the onion, radicchio, corn, and celery.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, dice the avocado and the tomato and add to the other vegetables with the vinaigrette, sprinkle with the grated cheese, and toss again.  Correct seasoning to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss the greens with the reserved vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the salad greens among 4 salad plates.  Mound the chopped salad on the greens and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  No one I know grows better vegetables than the Chino family on their farm in Rancho Santa Fe.  If you live in Southern California it&apos;s worth a trip just to see them growing in their fields.  If you live further afield, shop carefully at your local farmer&apos;s market.  What tastes better on a hot summer day than a fresh vegetable salad!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Itís always a challenge to find a wine that can match the acidic power of a good vinaigrette but I find that some of the really rounded and rich Californian Chardonnays can taste surprisingly good with a salad like this.  Estancia, Woodbridge (from Robert Mondavi) and Beringer Chardonnays are all readily available and represent great value.  Donít be surprised if you find something you really like at your wine store for around $10!

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  flour
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     scallion -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  6              small  scallions -- cut in half

In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt, egg and sesame oil.  Whisk in the milk, then unless your batter is completely lump free, strain into another bowl.  (The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream).  If the batter is too thick, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you get the desired consistency.

Stir in the ginger, garlic and sliced scallion.

Heat the butter in a non-stick crepe pan over moderate heat.  Add 2 tablespoons batter, then swirl the pan to coat the bottom with batter.  Cook the pancake over high heat until golden brown.  Turn it over and brown the other side.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.  Repeat the process until all the batter is used.

Cut each pancake in half, place a scallion on each and roll into a cone shape.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 pancakes.

Comments:  These pancakes are designed as the accompaniment to "Chinese Duck With Plum Sauce" (see recipe).  But there's no reason why you can't serve them with all kinds of things -- roast chicken, grilled meat or even steaks.  Be adventurous!  Have fun!

                         Chocolate Bread Pudding

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUSTARD ===
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  1 1/2         ounces  unsweetened chocolate
  3              whole  eggs
  3                     egg yolks
  2               cups  half-and-half
                        === SOAKING LIQUID ===
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa
  8             slices  brioche or challah, 1/2" thick

Prepare the custard:  In a stainless steel bowl or double boiler placed over simmering water, melt the two chocolates.

In a large stainless steel bowl, beat the whole eggs and the egg yolks.  Gradually whisk in the sugar and beat until fluffy.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan bring the half-and-half to a rolling boil.  Slowly whisk into the egg mixture.  Then, whisk in the melted chocolate.  Chill over ice and refrigerate, covered, until needed.  (This should be prepared the day before so that the custard will thicken.)

When ready to prepare the pudding, combine the soaking liquid ingredients in a saucepan and heat until the cocoa is completely dissolved.  With a 2-inch cookie cutter cut each slice of bread into two 2-inch circles (16 circles).  Arrange the circles of bread in 1 or 2 dishes large enough to hold the circles in one layer.  Pour the soaking liquid over and soak well, turning so that the bread absorbs as much liquid as possible.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter eight 1-cup molds or custard cups.

Prepare the pudding:  Spoon a layer of custard (about 1/4 cup) into the bottom of each of the 8 cups.  Using a slotted spoon remove a circle of bread and set in the custard.  Spoon over a second layer of custard, a second circle of bread and top with a final layer of custard.  Repeat this procedure, filling the remaining cups with custard and bread, and then arrange the cups in a large baking pan.  Fill the pan with boiling water, halfway up the sides of the cups.  Bake 30 minutes.  Cool and refrigerate until needed.

Dust the puddings with sifted powdered sugar and pass a bowl of unsweetened whipped cream around the table.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  If the thought of serving chocolate soufflÈ makes you nervous for fear that it might not be perfect, try this Chocolate Bread Pudding.  It is as delicious as any soufflÈ and can be prepared in advance.

Wine Recommendation:  Chocolate is such an intense sensation that I like to pair it with something crisp and refreshing.  A Charbaut RosÈ Champagne or perhaps a Californian Sparkling RosÈ from Domaine Chandon.  Or you can travel the more traditional route and look to a dessert wine from Sauternes or the wonderful Bonny Doon Vin de Glaciere.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature,
                        cut into small pieces
  1                cup  light brown sugar
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2         ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- melted over
                        water bath or in microwave
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped pecans or walnuts -- (1/2 lb)
                        = (or toasted and cooled unsalted
                        peanuts, coarsely chopped)
  1 3/4           cups  semisweet chocolate chips

Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl of an electric mixer, using paddle or beaters, and on medium speed, soften the butter.  Add the brown and granulated sugars, raising the speed to high when the sugar is incorporated, and continue to mix until fluffy, stopping machine and scraping down sides of bowl and under beaters as necessary.  Lower speed to medium, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the vanilla.  Stop machine, scrape in the melted chocolate, and beat until thoroughly combined.  Turn speed to low, gradually add in the flour mixture, and beat just until combined.  Add nuts and chocolate chips, and again beat just until combined.  If the dough is soft, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, for 1 to 2 hours.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 baking trays with parchment paper.

Using a small ice cream scoop, divide the dough into mounds, about 2 tablespoons each, forming small balls of dough.  (Dough can be rolled, placed on trays, and refrigerated until needed.)  Arrange the rolled balls on the prepared baking trays, about 2 inches apart.  Bake until slightly firm to the touch, about 15 minutes, reversing trays front to back after 7 to 8 minutes.  Remove cookies from trays with a wide metal spatula and cool on wire rack.  If reusing a baking tray, cool slightly before arranging balls of dough on it.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

                      Chocolate Shortbread Footballs

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1 1/2           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cocoa -- sifted
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  Mascarpone
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
                        === ROYAL ICING ===
  1                cup  sifted confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  egg white

Cream together the butter and sugar for 5 minutes.  Add the cocoa and flour and mix together well until it combines.  Allow to rest for 1 hour, covered in plastic.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

With a rolling pin, roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness and with a cookie cutter shaped like a football, cut the dough into footballs.  Place on parchment paper on cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes.  Turn the sheet and bake another 5 minutes.  Allow to cool.

Mix together the mascarpone and 2 tablespoons of confectioners' sugar until well blended.  Spread a little of this mixture on one football and top with a second football to make a sandwich.  Continue spreading the mixture until all cookies are used.

To make the royal icing, combine the 1 cup of confectioners' sugar with the egg white.  Mix until the consistency is very smooth.  Pour icing into a piping bag fitted with a round #1 tip.  Pipe a football lace design on the cookies.  Let dry.

This recipe yields 12 small cookie sandwiches.

Raw Egg Caution:  The American Egg Board states:  "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning...  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with their shell."

Raw Egg Caution:  The American Egg Board states:  &quot;There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning...  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with their shell.&quot;

                          Chocolate Truffle Cake

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TRUFFLES ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- cut small pieces
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  flavoring of your choice - (orange,
                        almond, or raspberry liqueur, etc.)
  8                     fresh perfect raspberries -- (optional)
                        === CHOCOLATE CAKE ===
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- cut small pieces
  5             ounces  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  3                     eggs -- room temperature
  3                     egg yolks -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)
                        Ice cream -- (optional)

For the Truffles:  Combine the chocolate, cream and butter in a small heatproof bowl set over simmering water and let melt.  When almost melted, remove from heat and stir the mixture until smooth.  Stir in your flavoring of choice and refrigerate until thick enough to mound on a spoon, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Line a baking tray with waxed or parchment paper.  Scrape the chocolate mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a #3 plain tip.  Pipe 8 (1-inch) mounds onto the prepared tray.  Place 1 raspberry in the center of each chocolate mound and pipe a little more of the chocolate mixture to enclose completely.  Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.

For the Cake:  Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter or coat with vegetable spray, 8 oversize muffin cups (4-inches wide and 2-inches deep) or 1 1/4-cup custard cups.  Line bottoms with rounds of waxed paper.

In the top of a double boiler or a small heatproof bowl set over simmering water, melt together the chocolate and butter, cool slightly.

Meanwhile in the bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle or beaters, beat the eggs, egg yolks and sugar on high speed until tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.  Scrape in the chocolate mixture and, on low speed, beat until just combined.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the flour, using a rubber spatula.

Spoon a little of the batter into each of the prepared cups, top with 1 truffle, and cover with the remaining batter.  Arrange the cups on a baking tray and bake until the edges of the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the cups, 12 to 13 minutes.

Let stand 10 minutes.  Invert onto individual dessert plates and carefully peel off the paper.  Serve warm.  Spoon softly whipped cream or ice cream next to each cake and, if desired, garnish with a few fresh raspberries.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                           Christmas Apple Pie

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Sugar Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  chopped pitted prunes
     1/4           cup  chopped dried apricots
     1/4           cup  chopped dried figs
     1/4           cup  Calvados
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  5             pounds  Pippin or Granny Smith apples - (abt 10)
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              large  egg white -- lightly whisked
  1 1/2    tablespoons  crystallized sugar -- see * Note

* Note:  Crystallized sugar, a coarse sugar with larger granules than granulated sugar is used to sprinkle on certain pastries before baking, for a shinier look.  It can be found in specialty food or cake decorating stores.  Substitute granulated sugar if crystallized is unavailable.

Prepare the crust:  Divide the pastry into two parts; one a little larger than the other.  Wrap the smaller piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.  On a lightly floured surface, shape the larger piece of pastry into a round ball.  With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll into a circle about 1/8-inch thick and about 11 inches in diameter.  Fit pastry circle into a 9-inch pie plate.  With a small sharp knife, trim the edges leaving about 1/2 inch overhang.  Chill for about 30 minutes while you prepare the filling.  (If you are using a glass pie plate, remove fron the refrigerator about 15 minutes before filling.)

Prepare the filling.  In a small bowl combine the chopped prunes, apricots and figs with the Calvados.  Set aside to allow fruit to plump.

Peel, core and slice the apples into 1/4-inch thick slices.  In a large, heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, melt 3 tablespoons of butter and cook until it just begins to brown.  Add about half of the sliced apples and toss to coat in the butter.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup sugar over and continue to cook for about 10 to 15 minutes or until apples are tender and caramelized.  Pour in 1 tablespoon of brandy and ignite.  Cook for about 30 seconds until alcohol burns off.  Stir in 1 tablespoon heavy cream.  Transfer caramelized apples to a large mixing bowl; set aside to cool.  Repeat this process with remaining apples, sugar, brandy and cream.  Stir plumped, dried fruits, lemon juice, cinnamon, lemon and orange zests and nutmeg into apple mixture.  Set aside until ready to assemble pie.

To cut lattice strips.  On a lightly floured board, roll out the reserved piece of sugar pastry dough into a rectangle about 5 1/2 inches by 11 inches, about 1/8-inch thick.  Cut a strip of thin cardboard, 1/2-inch wide and 10 inches long.  Tightly wrap the strip in plastic wrap and use as a guide for cutting the strips.  With a sharp knife cut the pastry into ten 1/2-inch wide strips.  Carefully arrange the strips on a large parchment-lined baking sheet.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap; refrigerate until needed.

Assemble the pie.  Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.  Spoon apple and fruit filling into prepared pie shell, gently mounding.  Place 5 pastry strips evenly spaced over the mounded apple filling and across the entire pie, leaving ends unattatched.  Fold every other strip back halfway (strips 1, 3 and 5).  For the next layer of cross strips, place one center cross strip, directly across filling in the middle of the pie and at right angles to the first layer of strips.  Replace folded-back strips.  Fold back halfway the alternate strips (strips 2 and 6).  Position second cross strip.  Repeat until the five cross strips are placed on top of the bottom layer of 5 strips and a lattice has been woven.

Brush the entire edge of the pie with water and tuck overhang over the ends of the pastry strips; press and seal edges securely.  Flute or pinch to form a decorative edge around the pie.  Brush latticework with beaten egg white and sprinkle with crystallized sugar.

Bake for 30 minutes; reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake from 35 to 40 minutes longer or until crust is golden.  If crust is browning too much around edges, loosely cover edges with foil.  Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Serve warm with scoops of Cinnamon Ice Cream or Vanilla Ice cream and a stick of cinnamon.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Though we serve this pie at my restaurants during the holiday season, it is much too good to be confined to such a limited period of time.  Try to find Pippin or Granny Smith apples.  They retain their shape during the cooking process, but must be sautÈed first to become tender.

Wine Recommendation:  If you haven't tried Calvados before, this might be a good opportunity.  It's the famous apple brandy from Normandy in France and although it's usually fiery, it has a magical apple flavor that is the perfect partner for this apple pie.  Pour into a brandy balloon, swirl around using the heat of your hand to warm it a little and release the bouquet.  Then sip slowly between bites of the pie.

                           Classic Beef Lasagna

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Wolfgang's Hearty Beef Bolognese Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1              large  egg -- beaten
                        === PASTA ===
  1            package  lasagne noodles - (16 oz)
                        = (or 1 lb fresh pasta sheets)
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  shredded mozzarella cheese
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Freshly-chopped parsley

Prepare recipe for Wolfgang's Hearty Beef Bolognese Sauce; set aside to cool.

In large bowl combine ricotta cheese, mascarpone, grated Parmesan and egg.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

Meanwhile, if using dried, packaged lasagna noodles, cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to touch).  Drain and plunge into a bowl of iced water to stop cooking.  Remove noodles from water and lay on an oiled baking sheet, separating the layers of noodles with plastic wrap.  If using fresh pasta sheets, cook only 2 or 3 sheets at a time and follow same directions as for dried noodles.

Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.  With olive oil lightly brush a 13- by 9- by 2 1/2-inch ovenproof baking dish.  Lay about 3 cooked lasagna noodles on base of dish to cover completely.  Cover the noodles with a layer of Bolognese sauce (about 2 cups) then another layer of noodles.  Cover with about half the ricotta mixture then repeat layering one more time.  Top with a final layer of noodles then Bolognese sauce (about 2 cups) and sprinkle top with mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.

Bake lasagna for about 45 minutes or until heated through and browned and bubbly.  Let rest 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

Sprinkle generously with freshly chopped Italian parsley and serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is an absolute classic, an all-time favorite comfort food.  Although I prefer fresh home-made pasta, nowadays you can find good quality store-bought pasta sheets.  These are layered with a rich beef bolognese sauce and a creamy ricotta filling, topped off with mozzarella cheese, melted and browned for a robust and heartwarming dish.

Wine Recommendation:  Beef Lasagna calls for a big wine, a red with body and soul.  For me this would be either a Rhone wine from Hermitage, Cote Rotie or Chateauneuf du Pape.  Look for Guigal, J.L. Chave or Chapoutier.  Or if you want to stay with an Italian theme look for the great wines of Tuscany, the Chianti Classico Riservas.  I love the wines of Ornellaia and Altesino Brunello di Montalcino.

Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE CRUMBLE ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  unsweetened coca powder
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1-oz pieces
  3                     egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese -- room temperature,
                        cut into small pieces
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  3                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4             ounces  white chocolate -- melted

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter or coat with vegetable spray the bottom of a 9- or 10-inch springform pan.  Line a baking tray with parchment paper.  Set aside.

Make the crumble:  Sift together the flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt, and transfer to the workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Process with on/off turns until blended.  Arrange the pieces of butter around the flour mixture and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

In a small cup or bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cream with the processor running, pour the mixture through the feed tube, making certain you scrape out all the liquid from the cup.  Let the machine run until the dough begins to come together, about 1 minute.  (You should have about 4 cups.)

To make the crust, spoon 2 cups of the crumble into the prepared pan and press evenly over the bottom of the pan.  (The rounded bottom of a 1-cup measuring cup is perfect for leveling the crust, ensuring smooth edges.)

Spread the remaining crumble on the prepared baking tray.  Place the springform pan and baking tray in the oven and bake until the crumble is lightly toasted, 10 to 12 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.  When completely cool, wrap heavy-duty aluminum foil, or two layers of regular foil, around the bottom and halfway up the outside of the springform pan, pleating the foil to tighten.  Break up the crumble on the parchment paper, using your hands or a fork, and set aside.

Make the cake:  Place the cream cheese, sugar, and salt in the large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a a paddle or beaters.  On medium speed, beat until smooth, stopping often to scrape down the sides of the bowl and under the blade with a rubber spatula.  Turn the speed to high and continue to beat until nice and creamy.  Stop the mixer and add the sour cream, eggs, and vanilla, beat 3 minutes longer, again stopping the mixer and scraping down the sides of bowl and under the blade as necessary.  Stir in the melted chocolate and continue to beat until well combined and smooth.  You should have about 6 cups of the mixture.

Pour half the mixture (3 cups) into the springform pan.  Sprinkle half the cooked chocolate crumble (1 cup) over, pour in the remaining 3 cups of the cheesecake batter and cover the entire surface with the remaining 1 cup of the chocolate crumble.

Set the springform pan in the center of a slightly larger baking pan with sides.  Pour enough hot water into the larger pan to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan, but not above the foil.  Carefully place both pans in the oven and bake for 1 hour.  Cover the cake loosely with foil and continue to bake until the center of the cake is slightly firm, 20 minutes longer.  (Check the water level after 30 minutes, making certain there is enough water in the pan.)

Carefully remove both pans from the oven and transfer the springform pan to a wire rack to cool.  Fold the foil down the sides of the pan, helping the cake to cool.  When the cake has cooled remove the foil and allow the cake to cool completely.  Cover the pan loosely with a clean piece of foil and refrigerate overnight.

When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator.  Dip a long sharp knife in warm water and run the knife around the inside of the springform pan, loosening the cake from the pan.  Remove the outer ring.  Continue to dip the knife into warm water as necessary for neatly cut slices.

To serve, arrange a slice of cake on a pretty cake plate and garnish with fresh berries of your choice, raspberries, blueberries, or sliced strawberries.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  The chocolate crumble is used not only as a crust, but also as a layer and a topping.  The result is a creamy cheesecake with a crunchy texture.  I find the easiest way to melt the white chocolate is to break it up into small pieces and place it in a small cup or bowl.  Place the cup in the microwave oven, cover with a paper towel, and heat the chocolate, 30 seconds at a time, stopping the oven and stirring the chocolate, continuing to heat until melted.  It shouldn't take more than two or three 30-second periods.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a small glass of good late bottled port with cheesecake.  (Look for 'LBV' port in your wine store.)  Or, if you're celebrating something significant, think about buying a good vintage port and decanting it a few hours before dinner.  My favorites are Cockburns and Warre.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Garlic -- as needed
                        Kosher salt

Have a bowl of ice water ready.

Remove the ends of the desired number of garlic cloves.  In a small saucepan, pour in enough water to cover the garlic.  Salt lightly and bring to a boil.  Carefully drop the whole cloves into the water and blanch for 30 seconds.

Remove the cloves with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking process.

Repeat the process, again cooling the garlic by plunging it into the ice water.  Drain the garlic and dry it well.  The peels should slip off easily.  Cut the garlic into slices and use as needed.

This recipe yields as needed.

Comments:  There are various ways to sweeten garlic and remove some of the bite.  This is one way...very simple, very quick, and very effective.  The cloves should be tender but still crunchy.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PARMESAN CREAM SAUCE ===
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  whole white peppercorns
  1              small  thyme sprig
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === PASTA AND CHICKEN ===
  8             ounces  fettucine pasta -- fresh or dried
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  finely-diced pancetta
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
     1/4           cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped parsley
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- grilled or broiled
                        Thyme or oregano sprigs -- for garnish

First, make the Parmesan cream.  In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine white wine, shallots, peppercorns and thyme.  Cook about 7 to 8 minutes or until mixture is dry.

Add chicken stock; continue to cook until liquid reduces by half.  Add heavy cream and cook for about 2 minutes more or until sauce is slightly thickened.  Strain sauce through a fine mesh wire sieve.

Pour strained sauce into a blender.  Add grated Parmesan cheese, thyme and oregano; blend until smooth.  Strain one more time through fine mesh wire sieve.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground white pepper.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook fettucine until al dente.  (Time will vary depending on whether you use fresh or dried pasta.)

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat olive oil.  Add garlic and cook for about 1 minute.  Add pancetta, thyme and oregano and cook for about 2 minutes more.  Stir in chicken broth and deglaze pan.  Stir in prepared Parmesan cream.  Cook only until heated through.  Remove 1/2 cup sauce and set aside; keep warm.

When fettucine is cooked, drain and add to sauce in skillet together with chopped parsley and crushed red pepper flakes.  Stir to mix thoroughly.  Season to taste with salt, if necessary.

Slice cooked, grilled chicken breasts on the diagonal.

Twirl or mound coated fettucine onto two hot plates.  Fan out slices of chicken on top of pasta.  Drizzle with reserved 1/2 cup of sauce.  Garnish each plate with a thyme or oregano sprig.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  This is another one of our most popular dishes in our Cafes, a variation on a classic that is one of the most delicious and indulgent pasta dishes I know.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a little crisp acidity with a rich pasta like this so I turn to Sauvignon Blancs, the grassy, fruity wines from Sancerre and the Loire Valley in France.  Although today it may be better value to look homewards or down to New Zealand.  In California look for Robert Mondavi's Fume Blanc, Sanford, Kendall Jackson and Close du Bois.  From New Zealand search for Cloudy Bay, Babich, Morton Estate and Villa Maria.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fish skeletons -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  vegetable or other flavorless oil
  1              small  carrot -- peeled, sliced
     1/2                onion -- sliced
  1              small  celery stalk -- sliced
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1                     bouquet garni - (parsley, thyme,
                        peppercorns, and a bay leaf tied together
                        in cheesecloth)
  1              quart  water -- more or less

Clean the fish bones under cold running water, removing the gills from the head and any traces of blood on the frames.

In a large saucepan, heat the oil.  In it, sweat the fish bones and vegetables over low heat, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice to prevent them from browning.

Deglaze the pan with the wine, and then add enough water to cover the bones and vegetables by 2 inches.  Add the bouquet garni and bring the liquid to a boil.  Skim the froth from the surface, reduce the heat and simmer the stock for 20 to 25 minutes.

Strain the stock into a clean saucepan.  Bring it to a boil and reduce it over moderate heat to 1 quart.

Fish stock will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days or frozen for 2 to 3 weeks.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

               Goat Cheese Salad With Arugola And Raddichio

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
  1         tablespoon  sherry wine vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  almond or extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (or a mixture of both)
                        === SALAD ===
  4             ounces  fresh Chevre -- cut 4 equal slices
                        = (log shaped goat cheese)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, crushed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              small  radicchio heads
  2            bunches  arugola

Prepare the vinaigrette:  Combine the mustard, tarragon, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Slowly whisk in the oil.  Correct the seasonings, including the mustard and vinegar, and set aside.

In a bowl, let the cheese marinate in the olive oil for up to an hour with 1 teaspoon of the thyme leaves, the garlic and pepper.

Wash the radicchio and arugola and dry in a salad spinner or pat dry with clean paper towels.

In a bowl, toss the salad greens with enough of the vinaigrette to coat them lightly.  Divide the greens among 4 large salad plates.

Heat a non-stick saute pan until very hot and add 2 tablespoons of the goat cheese marinade.  Add the cheese and saute it over medium heat for 30 seconds on each side.

Top each salad with a slice of hot goat cheese.  Garnish the cheese with the remaining thyme leaves.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish is a successful marriage.  On the one hand there's the pungent, earthy flavor of the goat cheese.  Then there's the nuttiness of the arugola and the bite of the radicchio.  Somehow it seems to be a marriage made in heaven.

Wine Recommendation:  Itís always tough to select a wine to do battle with a salad.  The problem lies in the vinaigrette.  Thatís why I'd choose something like a Belgian Trappist ale or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Theyíre rich and fruity beers and provide a contrast with the goat cheese.

Prepare the vinaigrette:  Combine the mustard, tarragon, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Slowly whisk in the oil.  Correct the seasonings, including the mustard and vinegar, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, let the cheese marinate in the olive oil for up to an hour with 1 teaspoon of the thyme leaves, the garlic and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wash the radicchio and arugola and dry in a salad spinner or pat dry with clean paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, toss the salad greens with enough of the vinaigrette to coat them lightly.  Divide the greens among 4 large salad plates.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a non-stick saute pan until very hot and add 2 tablespoons of the goat cheese marinade.  Add the cheese and saute it over medium heat for 30 seconds on each side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top each salad with a slice of hot goat cheese.  Garnish the cheese with the remaining thyme leaves.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This dish is a successful marriage.  On the one hand there&apos;s the pungent, earthy flavor of the goat cheese.  Then there&apos;s the nuttiness of the arugola and the bite of the radicchio.  Somehow it seems to be a marriage made in heaven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Itís always tough to select a wine to do battle with a salad.  The problem lies in the vinaigrette.  Thatís why I&apos;d choose something like a Belgian Trappist ale or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Theyíre rich and fruity beers and provide a contrast with the goat cheese.

                        = (or regular lentils, if not available)
  10              cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe),
                        heated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
                        === MEATBALLS ===
  1              pound  ground chicken
  1                cup  blanched almonds -- toasted, ground
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/3                chopped onion
     1/3           cup  raisins -- chopped
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4      teaspoon  chili pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon zest

Prepare the soup:  In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add the onion, carrot, garlic, a bouquet of celery, parsley, and thyme tied together, the turmeric and the cumin.  SautÈ over high heat until the onions are glassy, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the lentils and the Chicken Stock, season lightly with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender.  Skim as necessary.

Remove the celery bouquet and transfer two thirds of the soup to a blender.  Blend until smooth and return to the saucepan.  Stir in the lemon juice and correct seasoning to taste.  Set aside until serving time.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Prepare the Meatballs:  In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken, almonds, bread crumbs, onion, raisins, egg, garlic, parsley, cilantro.  Add chili pepper flakes.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Divide the mixture into 40 meatballs, each approximately 1 inch in diameter and weighing 1 ounce.

For Garnish:  In a small bowl, combine the yogurt with the mint and lemon zest.  Refrigerate until serving time.

To Prepare Ahead:  The soup can be prepared earlier in the day.  The meatballs can be formed and refrigerated, covered.  The garnish can be prepared and refrigerated.  At serving time, continue with the recipe.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet or sautÈ pan.  Place meatballs in oven and cook until they are well browned and firm to the touch, turning to brown all sides, eight to 10 minutes.

Presentation:  Heat the soup and spoon into 8 to 10 soup bowls.  Divide the meatballs among the soup bowls and drizzle the yogurt mixture over.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  chickens -- (abt 2 lbs ea)
  2              small  garlic heads -- separated into
                        cloves, and peeled
     1/4           cup  Italian parsley leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 oz)
  1              large  lemon -- juiced

Halve and bone the chickens completely, leaving the first wing joint intact.

In a small saute pan, blanch the garlic cloves in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain.  Cut the garlic into paper-thin slices.  Toss them in a small bowl with the parsley and a little salt and pepper.

Stuff a little of the garlic mixture into the pockets under the skin of the chicken breasts and thighs (about 2 teaspoons per chicken).  Transfer the chicken to a large plate, cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to use.

Heat a charcoal or gas grill until moderately hot.  Grill the chickens 7 to 10 minutes per side, or just until the pinkness disappears.  Do not overcook.

Heat the butter in a saute pan and in it, gently saute the remaining garlic mixture.  Add the lemon juice and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Divide the chicken halves among 4 large heated dinner plates.  Top with the sauteed garlic and parsley.  Serve with fresh vegetables cooked al dente.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Heavenly Chocolate Mousse

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  5             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  8              large  egg whites
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice

In a large bowl whisk egg yolks together with 1/4 cup sugar.

Melt chocolate over a bain-marie or in a heat-proof bowl over simmering water.

In small saucepan, bring cream to a boil and stir it into the melted chocolate.

Stir the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks and sugar.  Set aside.

In a mixer with wire whisk, beat egg whites and lemon juice until they reach soft peaks.  Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue to beat until whites are stiff and very shiny.

Stir one third of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Fold in the remaining beaten egg whites, a third at a time.

Note: If the chocolate and egg yolk mixture should tighten, place the mixture back over the bain-marie, and vigorously whisk in 3 or 4 tablespoons of the beaten egg whites.  The chocolate will smooth out so you can continue with the recipe.

Pour into individual serving glasses or bowls and chill at last six hours or overnight.

Serve in individual glass dishes topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Close your eyes when you take the first bite of this mousse.  Roll it across your tongue and let the flavor linger.  If you're a chocolate lover you'll be transported.  I prefer using part bittersweet chocolate for mousse because it gives a more intense chocolate flavor and less sweetness.

Wine Recommendation:  Chocolate is such an intense sensation that I like to pair it with something crisp and refreshing.  A Charbaut RosÈ Champagne or perhaps a Californian Sparkling RosÈ from Domaine Chandon.  Or you can travel the more traditional route and look to a dessert wine from Sauternes or the wonderful Bonny Doon Vin de Glaciere.

Raw Egg Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning... Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with their shell."

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg yolks
  4 1/2         ounces  sugar
     1/4           cup  crËme fraiche
  1              ounce  dark rum
  4          teaspoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  plumped golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted for brushing
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- for coating
  3                     egg whites
  1             recipe  Strawberry Sauce -- (see below))
  1              pound  fresh strawberries -- hulled, and
                        cut in halves
                        === STRAWBERRY SAUCE ===
     1/2         pound  strawberries -- hulled
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2         whole  star anise
     1/2    tablespoon  orange zest
                        Juice of 1/2 orange
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2    tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Prepare the "kaiser" base.  In the mixer bowl, combine the egg yolks and 3 ounces of sugar.  Mix over medium speed, with the wire whisk, until pale yellow.  Add the crËme fraiche and rum.  Continue to mix until smooth.  Fold in the flour and raisins.  This can be prepared up to 1 day in advance.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Brush a 6-inch sautÈ pan with butter and sprinkle with sugar.

To make the Kaiserschmarren, in a separate mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks.  Add the remaining 1 1/2 ounces of sugar and continue to whip until stiff but not dry.  Fold the meringue into the "kaiser" base.  Spoon 1/4 of the souffled mixture into the sautÈ pan.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Repeat three more times, until all the batter is used.

Strawberry Sauce:  Combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Cook for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cover with plastic wrap.  Allow flavor to infuse for 10 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a blender and process until well incorporated.  Strain.  This can be prepared up to 3 days ahead.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

To serve, in a medium saucepan, reheat the Strawberry Sauce.  Add the fresh strawberries and toss until well coated.  Spoon sauce over each serving plate.  Divide the Kaiserschmarren with a spatula into large chunks, and arrange on top of the strawberry sauce so it looks a little like the Austrian alps.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is my version of an Austrian classic which is normally prepared as a pancake.  But we make it as a soufflÈ, making it lighter, fluffier and more refined.  The key to success with this spectacular dish is folding in the meringue perfectly -- don't overmix and don't undermix!  As soon as the meringue is combined it's ready to bake in a hot oven.

Wine Recommendation:  The spicy fruit in a classic Austrian or Alsatian Gewurtzraminer is the perfect foil for this ambitious dessert.  I like the wines of Hugel, and Dopff and Orion, both from Alsace.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature,
                        cut into small pieces
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder -- sifted
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- cut small pieces.
  3             ounces  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut small pieces.
     1/3           cup  light corn syrup
     1/3           cup  brandy

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter or coat with vegetable spray an 8 1/2- by 3 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  Set aside.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or beaters, beat the butter on medium speed.  Gradually pour in the sugar, raise the speed of high and beat until fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating just to combine.  Turn the speed to low and alternate adding the flour mixture and the buttermilk, starting and ending with the flour mixture (three additions of flour and two of buttermilk).  Add the vanilla with the last addition of buttermilk.

Scrape two-thirds of the batter into the prepared pan.  Add the sifted cocoa to the batter remaining in the bowl, and beat until well blended.  Fold in the chocolate chips.  Drop large spoonfuls of the chocolate mixture over the batter in the loaf pan and swirl through the batter with a metal spatula or flat knife, resulting in a marbled effect.  Bake until a cake tester gently inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Set on a rack to cool.

When completely cool, release the cake from the pan by running a sharp knife around the inside of the pan, separating the cake from the pan, and invert the cake onto a rack.  Place a pan below the rack and drizzle the glaze over the cake.  Let set.  Slip a long heavy spatula under the cake and transfer the cake to a flat surface.

To serve, cut a thin slice off both ends and cut the cake into eight slices.  No garnish is needed for this cake, but for color, you can place a strawberry or a spring of mint alongside each slice.

For Chocolate Glaze:  In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the chocolate and butter and set over a pan of simmering water.  Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water or the chocolate may burn.  Let melt almost completely, turn off the heat, and let the mixture continue to melt, stirring occasionally.

Whisk in the corn syrup and brandy until smooth.  Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean medium bowl and reserve, covered, in a warm spot until needed.  (The glaze can be made 2 or 3 days ahead, refrigerated, covered, and remelted over simmering water when needed.  Let sit over the warm water until smooth, stirring occasionally.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a favorite of Wolfgang Puck fans.  Itís very versatile.  If you double the recipe, you can bake it in a 10-inch bundt pan.  It can also be baked in a loaf pan, cupcake tins, a bundt pan, and all have turned out very well.  In the bundt pan, baking time is about 1 1/2 hours, the cupcakes bake in 20 to 25 minutes, and in the loaf pan, baking time is about 1 hour.  This is great with a glass of cold milk.

                              Melon Granita

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ices/Sorbets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  honeydew melon or watermelon juice
     1/4           cup  sugar -- or to taste
                        Lemon juice -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Midori liqueur

Add sugar and lemon to melon or watermelon juice to correct flavor.  Add Midori liqueur.

Pour mixture into one or two shallow baking pans to a depth of approximately 1/4 inch.  Place in freezer.  (If you pour any deeper, ice crystals will not form properly).

When you see a layer of ice on the surface, scrape to break it up and put pan back in freezer.  Continue this process until completely frozen.  Final product should look like sequins.

Place a scoop of granita into a solid wine glass or a classic martini glass and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a really refreshing intermezzo or palate cleanser to be served between courses.  By scraping the ice, rather than preparing a classic sorbet or sherbert, you get a texture that's crunchy but melts almost immediately you taste it.  In the summer it makes a great dessert all by itself.

                My Grandmother's Ravioli With Four Cheeses

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baking potatoes - (abt 2 large) -- scrubbed thoroughly
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  8             ounces  farmer's cheese
  5             ounces  goat cheese
  2             ounces  mascarpone cheese
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh mint leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chervil leaves
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  10                    sheets fresh pasta - (abt 6" by 12" ea)
     1/4           cup  semolina or all-purpose flour -- for dusting
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for eggwash
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

Make the filling:  Bake the potatoes in a preheated 350 degree oven until fork tender, about 20 to 40 minutes.  Peel, and while still warm, pass through a food mill, or mash thoroughly with a fork.  In a small skillet, heat the butter over medium heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until soft.  In a medium bowl, combine all the cheese, the herbs, and the beaten egg.  Add the cooked shallots and garlic and the warm potato.  Stir until blended (being careful not to over-mix, or the mixture will get pasty).  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.  Then, with lightly moistened hands, roll into small balls, about the size of a walnut.

Lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Arrange 3 to 4 balls of filling on the lower third of the length of 5 sheets of the dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart.  Brush around the balls with eggwash.  Fold the top half over to cover the balls.  Press the dough around each ball to seal, making sure that you do not have any air pockets.  With a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out the ravioli.  Dust 2 trays with semolina and arrange the ravioli on the trays, dusting with more semolina.  Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, over high heat, cook the butter until it begins to brown.  Drain the ravioli and toss into the browned butter, turning to coat both sides.  Add the cheese and season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 30 ravioli; 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Most people recall their Grandmother's cooking for its homespun simplicity.  My Grandmother was a wonderful cook, and as adventurous and creative as any young chef today.  This recipe is testimony to her powers.

Wine Recommendation:  Because this is my Grandmother's recipe I like to drink it with an Austrian white wine.  Look for wines that are spitzenwein, a mark which denotes the top quality wines.  Or you may want to look for a Gewurtztraminer or Riesling from Alsace, dry, fruity wines that usually represent great value.

                            Olive-French Bread

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  bread flour -- plus
  2          teaspoons  bread flour
  2               cups  cold water
  1 1/2       packages  active dry yeast
  4             ounces  Nicoise olives -- pitted, sliced
                        = (roll a rolling pin over the olives to
                        make them easier to pit)
  2          teaspoons  salt

Insert the dough hook into an electric mixer and on 1 or low speed, combine 5 cups flour and the water for 4 minutes.  Sprinkle the yeast over the dough, turn the speed to 2, and mix about 5 minutes longer.  (Dough will pull cleanly away from the bowl.)

Toss the olives with the 2 teaspoons flour, add to the dough with the salt and mix 2 minutes longer.  Remove the bowl from the mixer, cover with a clean tea towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.

Turn the dough out on a heavily floured surface, lightly knead into a ball, and let rest, covered for 45 minutes.

Punch out the air, cut the dough in half, and shape into two baguettes.  Place the loaves on one or two baking trays, sprinkle with flour, cover with the towel, and let rest for 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

With a single edge razor blade or a very sharp knife, make a slash down the center of each loaf.  Carefully slide the breads onto a baking stone and bake 10 minutes.  Spray with water (a spray can or bottle used for misting plants works well) and continue baking until the bread is well-browned, about 1 hour and 10 minutes longer.  (Baking at 400 degrees will give you a crustier bread, but you can bake the bread at 425 degrees for 1 hour, 10 minutes.)  Cool on a rack.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  The olives give this bread a delicious Mediterranean flavor.  With this recipe timing is very important.  Be sure to run the mixer exactly as specified.

Insert the dough hook into an electric mixer and on 1 or low speed, combine 5 cups flour and the water for 4 minutes.  Sprinkle the yeast over the dough, turn the speed to 2, and mix about 5 minutes longer.  (Dough will pull cleanly away from the bowl.)

With a single edge razor blade or a very sharp knife, make a slash down the center of each loaf.  Carefully slide the breads onto a baking stone and bake 10 minutes.  Spray with water (a spray can or bottle used for misting plants works well) and continue baking until the bread is well-browned, about 1 hour and 10 minutes longer.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  sliced Double-Blanched Garlic -- (see recipe)
     1/3           cup  Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe),
                        cut into large pieces
  3             medium  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  fresh regular or spinach pappardelle
  4             ounces  herbed goat cheese -- cut small pieces
  6                     fresh basil leaves - (to 8) -- cut into chiffonade

In a 12-inch sautÈ pan or skillet, heat the olive oil.  Lightly brown the garlic.  Add the Oven-Dried Tomatoes and the chopped fresh tomatoes and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.

Meanwhile, bring a large stockpot of water to a boil.  Add a large pinch of salt to the water and cook the pasta until it is al dente, about 1 minute for fresh pasta.  (Cook packaged pasta according to package directions.)  Drain the pasta and combine with the sauce.

After the pasta has been tossed with the sauce take a pair of tongs or a roasting fork and twirl the pasta in a mound on the plate.  Pour the sauce over the mound and garnish with the goat cheese and basil chiffonade.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I like a wider pasta like pappardelle with this very simple sauce, a combination of fresh and oven-dried tomatoes.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a California or Australian Chardonnay to match this pasta.  I love the wines from Rosemount and Peter Lehman from Australia, or Sonoma Cutrer or Acacia from California.  All are inexpensive.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3       packages  active dry yeast
                        = (1 tbspn plus 1 tspn)
  3               cups  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  honey
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  rye flour
  4 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary or thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried rosemary or thyme)
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3 1/2 oz) -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  chopped walnuts
  1 1/2           cups  chopped pecans

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of lukewarm water.

Place the remaining water, the honey, both flours, the salt, rosemary or thyme, and butter in a mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Mix for about 5 minutes.  Add the dissolved yeast and continue to knead in the mixer for about 10 minutes.  Add the walnuts and pecans and continue to knead until the nuts are thoroughly combined.  The dough should come together neatly in a ball.

Cover the mixing bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes at room temperature, or until it approximately doubles in volume.

Knead the dough briefly by hand to remove an air pockets.

Butter and flour three 9- by 5-inch loaf pans.  Divide the dough in three parts, shape each into a 9-inch cylinder and place them in prepared pans.  Let the loaves rise in the pans for about an hour, or until they at least double in volume.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the loaves for about 20 minutes, or until they are nicely browned, then reduce the heat to 325 degrees and continue baking for another 25 minutes.  Remove from pans and let cool.

This recipe yields three 9-inch loaves.

Comments:  This bread is fantastic toasted, with butter and marmalade for breakfast, or just grilled and served with ripe cheese and wine.  The recipe works best in the large quantity I've given here.  It freezes well.

                                Pecan Pie

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  light corn syrup
     3/4           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
  4                     eggs
  2                     egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2        recipe  Sugar Dough -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  pecan halves

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large skillet over medium heat, toast the pecans, shaking frequently, for about 7 minutes or until golden and fragrant.

Place the corn syrup, sugars, eggs, and egg yolks in a mixing bowl.  Beat well.

Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat until it turns brown and has as nutty aroma.  Stir it into the corn syrup mixture.

Line a 10-inch tart pan with the Sugar Dough.  Arrange the pecan halves in the bottom of the shell.  Ladle the filling over the pecans.

Bake the tart for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted near the center comes out clean.  Remove and let cool at room temperature.

Cut into wedges and serve with rum-flavored whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields one 10-inch tart; 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is an American classic, but one that requires special attention to avoid cloying sweetness or a soggy crust.  I like to toast the pecans before combining them with the other ingredients.  And a moderate oven works better than a hot one.

Wine Recommendation:  Pecan pie always presents a challenge when it comes to wine.  Do you choose sweetness to match the pie or contrast it with something drier and crisper?  Both ideas work, but for me I like a chilled glass of good Champagne or even a flinty Chablis, or Californian Chardonnay without too much wood.  If you can find them, Peter Michael's Chardonnays make an absolutely sublime (and expensive) partner for pecan pie.

Comments:  This is an American classic, but one that requires special attention to avoid cloying sweetness or a soggy crust.  I like to toast the pecans before combining them with the other ingredients.  And a moderate oven works better than a hot one.

Wine Recommendation:  Pecan pie always presents a challenge when it comes to wine.  Do you choose sweetness to match the pie or contrast it with something drier and crisper?  Both ideas work, but for me I like a chilled glass of good Champagne or even a flinty Chablis, or Californian Chardonnay without too much wood.  If you can find them, Peter Michael&apos;s Chardonnays make an absolutely sublime (and expensive) partner for pecan pie.

  2             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2        medium  yellow onion -- finely diced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2              large  leeks -  (14 oz ea) -- white part only,
                        coarsely chopped
  1              small  leek, white part only -- for garnish
  2              large  russet potatoes - (1 lb ea) -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  11            medium  garlic cloves - (abt 1 oz) -- blanched
  5               cups  Chicken Stock - (to 6) -- (see recipe),
                        heated
     3/4         pound  spinach -- washed well,
                        and trimmed
     1/4           cup  creme faiche
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2    tablespoon  lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  white pepper
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
                        Vegtable oil -- for frying
                        All-purpose flour -- as needed

In a 4-quart saucepan or stockpot, heat the olive oil.  Over medium-high heat, sweat the coarsely chopped leeks for about 5 minutes.  Add the potatoes and garlic and continue to sweat 2 or 3 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.

Pour in 5 cups Chicken Stock, lower the heat, and simmer until the potatoes are very tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Blanch the spinach, drain, and chop coarsely.  Transfer the spinach to a clean linen napkin and squeeze out the juice.  Reserve the spinach.

Puree the soup in a blender, strain through a medium strainer, and return then soup to a clean pot.  If the soup is too thick, add the remaining 1 cup of stock.  Place the creme fraiche in a small bowl.  Whisk some of the hot soup into the bowl until the creme fraiche is completely dissolved and then whisk back into the pot.

Break up the spinach and stir into the soup.  Season with the lemon juice, pepper, and nutmeg to taste.  Correct seasoning as necessary.  Heat over a low flame.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 325 degrees.  Cut the remaining leek into julienne and lightly coat with flour, shaking off any excess.  Carefully place the julienned leek into the hot oil and cook until golden, 1 or 2 minutes.  Remove with a flat strainer and drain on a clean towel.

Presentation:  Ladle the soup into heated bowls.  Sprinkle some of the fried leeks into each bowl and serve immediatley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                Potato, Roasted Garlic, And Basil Ravioli

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  baking potatoes -- peeled, quartered
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  Roasted Whole Garlic -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  6                     sheets fresh pasta - (abt 6" by 12" ea)
                        Semolina or all-purpose flour -- for dusting
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash
  1             recipe  Roasted Garlic And Herb Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  homemade Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Make the filling:  Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain.  In a medium bowl, combine the potatoes and Roasted Garlic.  Pass through a food mill on the fine setting, or mash thoroughly with a fork.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir until well blended.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Using a pastry bag or spoon, place about 10 tablespoons of filling on the dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart.  Brush around the mounds with eggwash.  Cover the mounded dough sheets with a second sheet of pasta.  Press down the dough around each mound to seal, making sure that you do not have any air pockets.  Using a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out the ravioli.  Pinch each ravioli around the edges to seal.  Dust 2 trays with semolina and arrange the ravioli on the trays, dusting the ravioli with more semolina.  Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes.

In a medium saucepan, reheat the Roasted Garlic And Herb Sauce (if too thick, add 1/4 cup stock).  Drain the ravioli and add them to the sauce, tossing to coat all sides.  Add 2 tablespoons of cheese and season with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.

Arrange five or six cooked ravioli in the center of a dinner plate, overlapping one another, in a circle.  Nap with the sauce and garnish with remaining freshly grated parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 36 to 40 ravioli; 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This hearty pasta has an unexpected delicacy of flavor.  Fresh herbs, combined with the roasted garlic and sharp Parmesan cheese, complement the flavor of the potato, making a subtle and delicious result.

Wine Recommendation:  Good Californian Chardonnays are so readily available today that it's possible to find some real bargains.  Look for Arrowood, Estancia, Fetzer Sundial, Monterey Vineyard, Napa Ridge, and of course, Robert Mondavi's Woodbridge wines.  They all make delicious and inexpensive partners for this pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE PISTOU ===
  1                cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
  1              bunch  basil leaves -- chopped

  4                     ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped fine
     1/2                lemon -- zested, grated

                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        === COURT BOUILLON ===
  2             medium  carrots
  2                     celery stalks
  1                     leek
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
                        = (or a pinch dried thyme)
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             quarts  water
  2               cups  dry white wine
                        === VEGETABLES AND SALMON ===
  2                     carrots -- peeled
  1                     leek, white part only
  2                     celery stalks -- strings removed
  2             pounds  Chinook or King salmon fillets

Combine the olive oil, sherry vinegar, basil, shallots, tomatoes, lemon rind, chives, and tarragon.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Let marinate overnight, unrefrigerated.

For Court Bouillon:  Slice carrots, celery and leek into 1/4 inch pieces.  Place in the bottom of a saucepan.  Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.  Boil for 20 minutes.  (Makes about 2 quarts)

Cut carrots, leek and celery into julienne.  Cook them in 1 cup strained Court Bouillon until tender but still crisp.  Drain and reserve.

Wrap each salmon fillet in foil and poach in court bouillon for approximately 5 minutes.  To check the degree of doneness, remove 1 package from the liquid and unwrap.  The center should still be slightly pink.

To serve, divide julienne of vegetables among serving plates.  Arrange salmon fillets in the center of the julienne and top each fillet with a tablespoon of the Sauce Pistou.  Serve remaining sauce separately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rack baby lamb rack - (abt 1 lb)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              small  rosemary sprig -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped rosemary
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2)
  1                cup  mirepoix - (equal parts coarsely chopped
                        onions, carrots, and celery)
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/2                bay leaf
                        Salt -- to taste
  4                     cooked fresh artichoke bottoms
  1                     lemon -- cut in half
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)
  1              sprig  fresh thyme -- leaves only
  12                    garlic cloves -- peeled, blanched

Trim all but a thin layer of fat from the lamb.  Cut off the last two inches of the rib bones.  Reserve all the trimmings.  Rub the rack with pepper and the rosemary sprig, then rub it with olive oil.  Cover the rack with plastic wrap and let it stand in the refrigerator overnight.

To make lamb stock:  Brown the cut lamb bones and trimmings in a little olive oil.  Add the mirepoix and brown for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the peppercorns and bay leaf.  Add water to cover, bring it to a boil and simmer slowly until the stock is reduced to cup.  Strain and reserve.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place the lamb in a shallow roasting pan and season it with salt.  Roast the rack for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the lamb is medium-rare.  Transfer the lamb to a carving board and let it rest in a warm spot for 10 minutes.

Slice the artichoke bottoms into thin slices and toss them with lemon juice.  In a sautÈ pan, sautÈ the artichoke slices slowly in 2 tablespoons of the butter, the thyme leaves, salt, pepper and 2 of the garlic cloves, cut into thin slices, until the artichokes are tender.  Add more butter if necessary as they cook.  Reserve.

While the lamb is resting, discard any grease from the roasting pan.  Deglaze the pan with the lamb stock.  Add the chopped rosemary.  When the sauce has reduced slightly, whisk in 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper and strain it.  Keep the sauce warm.

Heat a sautÈ pan, add the remaining butter and in it sautÈ the remaining garlic cloves until light golden brown.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                        Raspberries In Puff Pastry

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  Puff Pastry -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
  1                cup  heavy cream -- whipped
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or any orange-based liqueur)
  3               cups  raspberries - (1/2 cup per serving)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Roll out puff pastry to a rectangle slightly larger than 6 by 9 inches, 3/8-inch thick.  Cut pastry into six 3- by 3-inch squares.  Place them on a baking sheet and brush with egg wash, being careful not to let it drip onto the baking sheet.  Bake for 5 minutes; then lower the heat to 350 degrees, and bake 20 minutes longer.

While the pastry is baking, whisk together in a mixing bowl the whipped cream and Grand Marnier.  Chill until needed.

Remove feuilletÈes from the oven, cool on a wire rack.  Then slice them in half horizontally.  Place the bottom half of each one on a dessert plate and spread with a large dollop of whipped cream mixture.  Arrange the berries on the whipped cream and top with the remaining half of the feuilletÈe.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is one of my favorite desserts.  Once all the components are ready -- and they can be prepared earlier in the day -- it is a simple matter to put them together.  The puff pastry squares, called feuilletÈes, can also be used to make other desserts -- with various fruits, ice cream and sweet sauces.

Wine recommendation:  There's something so spectacular about this dish that it cries out for champagne.  Or even better, look for any of the Schramsberg bubblies from California, they're equal to any sparkling wines from anywhere in the world.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  goat cheese
  1              ounce  black French truffles
  4              whole  chicken breasts -- boned
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  port wine
     1/2           cup  reduced chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 oz) -- (1 ounce)
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
  1             medium  onion - (1/2 lb) -- minced fine
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  mushroom stock -- heated
  5               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe),
                        heated
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  wild mushrooms -- stems reserved
                        for stock
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped peeled seeded tomato
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (2 oz)
                        A large pinch chopped Italian parsley

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small bowl, crumble the goat cheese and combine with 1 teaspoon chopped black truffle.

Gently slip your fingers under the skin of each chicken breast, lifting it slightly.  Divide the cheese mixture and stuff some under the skin, patting down to distribute it evenly.

Rub each breast with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Put chicken breasts skin-side down on a grill or sear in a sautÈ pan until golden brown.  Turn breasts to meat side and sear for 5 minutes more.  Finish cooking in 350 degree oven for about 10 to 15 minutes until chicken breasts are done.  Do not overcook.

Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm.  Pour out any fat that may remain and deglaze the pan with port.  Add the stock and reduce just until the sauce thickens.  Whisk in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

To Make the Risotto:  In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the peanut oil.  Over medium-high heat, sautÈ the onion and garlic just to soften, stirring all the while, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the rice and continue to stir, using a wooden spoon, coating the rice with the oil and onion.

Deglaze with the white wine and cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often.  Pour in enough mushroom and/or chicken stock to cover, about 3 cups, and cook, stirring often, until the liquid is absorbed.

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the olive oil.  If the mushrooms are large, cut them into bite-size pieces and sautÈ over medium-high heat just to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.

Pour 3 cups of stock into the rice, turn the flame to high, and stir in a large pinch of salt and the tomatoes.  Stir until almost al dente.  Stir in the mushrooms and the remaining 1 cup of stock, as necessary.  Remember that the risotto should be creamy, not runny.  Remove from the flame and vigorously beat in the chilled butter and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until completely dissolved.  Stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

For Presentation:  Place one spoonful of mushroom risotto on heated plate, top with grilled chicken breast and spoon a little of the sauce over.  Using a mandoline, thinly slice the remaining truffle and sprinkle over each chicken breast.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, crumble the goat cheese and combine with 1 teaspoon chopped black truffle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gently slip your fingers under the skin of each chicken breast, lifting it slightly.  Divide the cheese mixture and stuff some under the skin, patting down to distribute it evenly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rub each breast with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put chicken breasts skin-side down on a grill or sear in a sautÈ pan until golden brown.  Turn breasts to meat side and sear for 5 minutes more.  Finish cooking in 350 degree oven for about 10 to 15 minutes until chicken breasts are done.  Do not overcook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm.  Pour out any fat that may remain and deglaze the pan with port.  Add the stock and reduce just until the sauce thickens.  Whisk in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Make the Risotto:  In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the peanut oil.  Over medium-high heat, sautÈ the onion and garlic just to soften, stirring all the while, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the rice and continue to stir, using a wooden spoon, coating the rice with the oil and onion.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deglaze with the white wine and cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often.  Pour in enough mushroom and/or chicken stock to cover, about 3 cups, and cook, stirring often, until the liquid is absorbed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the olive oil.  If the mushrooms are large, cut them into bite-size pieces and sautÈ over medium-high heat just to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 3 cups of stock into the rice, turn the flame to high, and stir in a large pinch of salt and the tomatoes.  Stir until almost al dente.  Stir in the mushrooms and the remaining 1 cup of stock, as necessary.  Remember that the risotto should be creamy, not runny.  Remove from the flame and vigorously beat in the chilled butter and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until completely dissolved.  Stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Presentation:  Place one spoonful of mushroom risotto on heated plate, top with grilled chicken breast and spoon a little of the sauce over.  Using a mandoline, thinly slice the remaining truffle and sprinkle over each chicken breast.  Serve immediately.

       Roast Salmon With Black Pepper, Ginger, On Celery Root Puree

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets, 3/4"thick - (6 to 7 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2    tablespoons  crushed black peppercorns
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh ginger
                        === SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3                     shallots -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     plum tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2               cups  Cabernet Sauvignon
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Celery Root Puree -- (see recipe)

Season the salmon lightly with salt.  Brush the top of the salmon with a little melted butter and immediately sprinkle evenly with crushed pepper and chopped ginger.  Drizzle the remaining butter over the salmon.  If you wait too long, the butter will harden and the mixture won't stick.  Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Prepare the sauce:  In a small saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter until foamy.  Over medium heat, saute the shallots and garlic until the shallots are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the tomato and cook 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Pour in the wine and vinegar, turn up the heat a little, and reduce until 1/2 cup remains.  Pour in the Chicken Stock and reduce by half.  Strain into a clean pan.  Finish sauce by whisking in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Keep warm.

Brush some olive oil over a baking tray large enough to hold the salmon slices in 1 layer and arrange the salmon on the pan.  Roast until medium, about 10 minutes.  The salmon should be cooked on the outside, but still moist and slightly underdone on the inside.

Divide the sauce among 4 warm dinner plates.  Spoon equal amounts of Celery Root Puree in the center of each plate and place 1 piece of salmon on top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Roasted Beet Napoleon

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  yellow or red beets - (at least 3" dia) -- washed, trimmed
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        recipe  Herbed Goat Cheese -- (see recipe),
                        cut into eight round slices
  1                cup  mixed baby lettuces - (to 1 1/2) -- washed, dried
     1/4           cup  Spago House Salad Dressing -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  Citrus Hazelnut Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
  1              ounce  toasted hazelnuts -- coarsely chopped

To roast beets:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place the beets in a small roasting pan and pour in enough cold water to reach about one quarter of the way up the sides of the beets.  Cover the pan with foil, and roast the beets until they are tender, 2 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes.  To check for doneness, gently insert a bamboo skewer into a beet.  The skewer should slide through easily.  Remove the beets from the pan, allow to cool, and then peel.

Cut each beet into 1/4-inch-thick round slices.  Cut each slice with a 3-inch round cookie cutter.  (You will need ten rounds.)  Cut trimmings into 1/4-inch dice and reserve 1/2 cup for garnish.

In a sautÈ pan, bring vinegar and sugar to a boil.  Lower to a simmer and poach beets one minute on each side.  With a slotted spatula, remove and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

When ready to assemble, heat the olive oil in a small sautÈ pan.  Arrange the slices of Herbed Goat Cheese in the pan and warm slightly, turning them with a small spatula just to warm both sides.  This has to be done quickly or the cheese will melt.

To assemble the Napoleons:  Place one of the beet rounds on a firm, flat surface and begin to layer.  Top with a slice of goat cheese, then another beet round, a second slice of cheese, another beet round, a third slice of cheese and a beet round.  (Continue until you have five layers of beets and four layers of cheese.)  Carefully cut through layers, dividing into three wedges.  Repeat with the remaining beets and cheese.

To serve:  Arrange three of the wedges, pointed ends facing out, in a circle in the center of each plate.  Toss the baby lettuces with the Spago House Dressing and mound half of the lettuces on top of each arranged napoleon.  Drizzle one half of the Citrus Hazelnut Vinaigrette around each mound.  Sprinkle toasted nuts and reserved diced beets on top of drizzled vinaigrette.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  This stacked salad has become a standard at Spago.  Rounds of brilliant red beets layered with slices of white goat cheese make up one of the most striking and elegant appetizers we serve.  The earthy beets and pungent cheese ask for just a drizzle of House Dressing and a sprinkling of toasted nuts.  Add some greens for more color, or serve it without.  Easy to make, this is the appetizer for impressing your friends.  Try to purchase beets that are all about the same size.  To save time, roast and chill the beets beforehand.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  sifted flour
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  apricot preserves
  1         tablespoon  apricot brandy
                        === GLAZE ===
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate - (to 10)
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        === CHOCOLATE CHANTILLY ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cocoa

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan.

Melt the chocolate over simmering water.  Set aside to cool.

Cream the butter, 3/4 cup sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla.  Stir in the chocolate and set aside.

In an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and salt to stiff peaks.  With the machine running, add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Fold in 8 ounces sifted flour.  Stir one third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Fold in the remaining egg whites, gently but thoroughly.  Turn into the springform pan.

Bake approximately one hour.  To check for doneness, insert a toothpick gently into the cake.  It should come out dry.  Remove the ring of the pan and cool the cake on a rack.

To make the apricot filling:  Puree the apricot jam through a food mill fitted with the finest disk (or use a food processor).  Stir in the apricot brandy.  Set aside until ready to use.

Slice cake in half horizontally to make two layers.  Spread the bottom layer with two thirds of the apricot filling and top with the second layer.  Spread top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of filling.  Chill.

To make the glaze:  Melt chocolate and butter over simmering water.  Remove from heat and cool until it reaches glazing consistency.  Spread over cake and chill.

Remove sachertorte from refrigerator 1 hour before serving.  Serve a wedge of cake with Chocolate Chantilly.

For Chocolate Chantilly:  With an electric mixer, whip the cream until ribbons form.  Beat in the sugar just until the cream holds soft peaks.  Sift the cocoa over the cream and fold in gently.  (Plain creme chantilly is prepared exactly the same way.  Just omit the chocolate.)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                           Salzburger Nockerln

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RASPBERRY JAM ===
  12            ounces  fresh raspberries - (abt 2 baskets)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === SALZBURGER NOCKERLN ===
  1             recipe  Raspberry Jam -- heated
  7             ounces  sugar
  2        tablespoons  tapioca flour -- sifted
  4                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
  1         tablespoon  orange zest -- finely minced
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest -- finely minced
  8                     egg whites

Make the raspberry jam.  In a small sautÈ pan, combine 6 ounces of raspberries, sugar, orange juice and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil and cook for about 3 minutes, whisking vigorously to break apart the raspberries.  The mixture should resemble a loose jam.  Remove from the heat and add the remaining 6 ounces of raspberries, stirring gently until well coated.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Pour the warm raspberry jam into a 7- by 11-inch baking dish.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1 ounce of sugar and tapioca flour.  Add the egg yolks, Grand Marnier, orange zest and lemon zest.  Whisk until light in color.

In an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, beat together the egg whites and 1 ounce of sugar to soft peaks.  Add the remaining 5 ounces of sugar in a slow, steady stream and continue to whip to stiff peaks.

Stir 1/3 of the meringue into the egg yolk mixture to blend.  Fold in the remaining meringue and continue to gently mix until well blended.

Spoon into 3 equal mounds over the Raspberry Jam, shaping to resemble the 3 mountains of Salzburg.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden and risen like a souffle.  Serve immediately with extra raspberry jam and fresh whipped cream or crËme Anglaise.

You want to serve the Salzburg Nockerln in the container you cooked it in.  Sprinkle the 'hills' with powdered sugar and your favorite berries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments;  Salzburg is a wonderful town on the Bavarian Border famous for its small hills called 'Nockerln'.  This dish celebrates the hills of Salzburg with its hills of heaped Meringue.  It's rich, indulgent and utterly delicious.  This is a true Austrian dessert that brings back memories of good times and loved ones.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

                     Simple Sourdough Farmer's Bread

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7               cups  rye flour
  4               cups  lukewarm water
  2           packages  active dry yeast
  3 1/4           cups  whole-wheat flour
  4 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  3          teaspoons  cumin

To prepare the sourdough starter:  Place 1 1/2 cups of the rye flour and 2/3 cup of the lukewarm water in a large bowl and mix well.  Cover with a damp towel and let sit at room temperature for at least 24 hours.  The mixture will become a little bubbly and give off a slightly fermented smell.  (If the room is cool, this may take a little longer.)

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the lukewarm water.

Place the remaining water, the sourdough starter, the remaining rye flour and the whole wheat flour, the salt, and knead the dough in the mixer for another 20 minutes.  The dough should come together neatly in a ball.

Cover the mixing bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise at room temperature for about 45 minutes, or until it doubles in volume.

Knead the dough briefly by hand to remove any large air pockets.

Butter and flour three 9- by 5-inch loaf pans.  Divide the dough in three parts, shape each into a 9-inch cylinder, and place them in the prepared pans.  Let the loaves rise for 1 hour or so, or until they at least double in volume.  With a sharp knife, cut one long slash, about 1/2-inch deep, on the tops of the loaves.  (This allows the dough to expand as it bakes.)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the loaves for about 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and continue baking for about 20 minutes.  Remove the loaves from the pans and let cool.

This recipe yields three 10-inch loaves.

Comments:  I bake this bread in a rather hot oven to give the loaves a nice thick crust.  The sourdough starter must be prepared at least a day ahead.

                           Spago Cucumber Salad

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  thinly-sliced Japanese cucumbers -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sesame seeds

* Note:  If Japanese cucumbers are not available, English cucumbers can be substituted.  The English cucumbers need to be peeled, cut lengthwise, seeded and sliced into thin half moons.

In a large bowl, combine cucumbers and salt and mix well.  Add sugar, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil and mix well.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and mix.

Put aside and let marinate for 20 minutes before serving.  Adjust seasonings before serving.

Divide salad among four chilled plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is one of our favorite side dishes at Spago.  It has a wonderful crisp taste and a slight Asian flavor.  You can use it with fish, chicken or as a side dish by itself.  Itís great to use during anytime of the year.

Wine Recommendation:   This salad is perfect for a Sauvignon Blanc.  Also it can be pared with Sake, which is Japanese rice wine.  Robert Mondaviís Fume Blanc is a suitable option for this dish.

Comments:  This is one of our favorite side dishes at Spago.  It has a wonderful crisp taste and a slight Asian flavor.  You can use it with fish, chicken or as a side dish by itself.  Itís great to use during anytime of the year.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:   This salad is perfect for a Sauvignon Blanc.  Also it can be pared with Sake, which is Japanese rice wine.  Robert Mondaviís Fume Blanc is a suitable option for this dish.

Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Sugar Dough -- (see recipe)
  8              small  cooking apples
                        = (Pippin -- Granny Smith or
                        Golden Delicious)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3 oz)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  Calvados or Cognac
     1/2         pound  Puff Pastry -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
                        Vanilla ice cream

Roll the Sugar Dough into two 11-inch squares.  Put each on a parchment paper-lined tray and chill for 20 minutes.  Cut eight 5-inch circles and fit them into eight 4- by 1/2-inch tartlette tins or flan rings.  Trim away any extra dough and chill the tins in the refrigerator.

Peel, core and slice the apples 1/4-inch thick.

Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium high heat, add the apples and sprinkle with the sugar.  Cook quickly, for 2 or 3 minutes so that the sugar caramelizes, but the apples remain slightly crunchy.

Pour the Calvados over the apples and let the alcohol cook off for a few seconds.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

On a floured surface, roll the Puff Pastry to 1/8-inch thickness.  With a 4-inch cookie cutter, cut 8 circles, rerolling scraps if necessary.  With the tip of a small sharp knife, draw a design in the center of the puff pastry circles.  Take care not to cut all the way through.  Refrigerate until needed.

Divide the apples equally among the tart shells.  Place half a teaspoon of butter in the center of each.  Top each with a puff pastry circle, leaving the sides unsealed.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.  Let them rest for about 10 minutes before serving.  Remove the pies from the tins or rings.

Place a tart in the center of each dessert plate, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

This recipe yields eight 4-inch tarts,

Comments:  This has always been one of our most popular desserts at Spago.  Guests seem to love the fact that everyone gets their own complete apple pie.  The combination of the two pastries provides different textures although the Puff Pastry that tops these apples tartlettes can be replaced with Sugar Dough.

Wine Recommendation:  Apple pie loves a sweet dessert wine partner.  A Beaumes de Venise from the Rhone Valley in France or Bonny Doon's Vin de Glaciere from California both offer a honeyed smoothness without the cloying qualities of many inexpensive dessert wines.

        Spinach-Blue Cheese Salad With Sliced Apples, Spicy Pecans

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     apple -- chilled
                        Juice of 1 small lemon
  8             ounces  spinach -- washed, thoroughly
                        dried/ and stemmed
  1              small  radicchio head - (abt 3 oz) -- cut into chiffonade
     1/2           cup  blue cheese -- crumbled
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  Spago House Salad Dressing -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  Spicy Caramelized Pecans -- (see recipe)

Cut the apple into quarters, remove the stem and the seeds, and cut into very thin slices.  Sprinkle lemon juice over the slices and set aside.

When ready to serve, in a salad bowl, combine the apple, spinach, radicchio and blue cheese.  Season lightly with salt and pepper and toss with the dressing.  Adjust seasoning to taste.

To serve, divide the salad among 4 plates and sprinkle the pecans around each salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  What makes this salad exciting is the combination of flavors.  The pungent blue cheese.  The freshness of the apple.  The sweetness of the pecans.  And the bitterness of the radicchio.  Make the salad with baby spinach if it's available.  The apple should be tart and crisp.  A firm pear can be substituted for the apple.

Wine Recommendation:  It's always tough to select a wine to do battle with a salad.  The problem lies in the vinaigrette.  That's why I'd choose something like a Belgian Trappist ale or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  They're rich and fruity and provide a fitting partner for such a fresh salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3        recipe  Sugar Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- slightly softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur
                        Zest of 2 oranges -- finely grated
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  2               cups  ground almonds
     1/4           cup  currant jelly -- melted
  2                     baskets strawberries -- sliced 1/4" thick

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

On a floured surface, roll the pastry 3/8-inch thick and line a 10-inch flan ring with it.  Place the ring on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and chill it until needed.

Cream the butter and sugar lightly in an electric mixer; don't let the butter get too soft.  Add the eggs and mix lightly.

Stir in the liqueur, zest and almond extract, then mix in the ground almonds.

Pour into the chilled pastry shell and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the pastry and marzipan are a deep golden brown.

Remove the tart from the oven and let cool to room temperature.

Brush the top of the tart with the currant jelly.  Cover the top of the tart with sliced strawberries arranged in concentric circles or in a flower petal design, making certain the whole top of the tart is covered.

Remove the flan ring and transfer the tart to a flat serving platter.  Cut into wedges.

This recipe yields one 10-inch tart.

Comments:  One of the advantages of serving a tart is that you do all the work in advance.  This is a simple tart, easy to make -- even the kids can get involved!  It's a creamy, fruity delicious dessert with a great almond flavor.

Wine Recommendation:  I like to serve a tart like this with coffee and a liquer.  Amaretto di Saronno or Frangelica are both perfect.  Of course there's nothing to stop you getting out one of your precious old Sauternes or a Vintage Port.

                           Strawberry Shortcake

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORTCAKE ===
  2 3/4           cups  pastry or cake flour
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus additional
                        sugar to sprinkle on top
  1         tablespoon  baking powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into 2 tablespoon-pieces
  1                cup  heavy cream -- plus additional
                        heavy cream to brush on top
                        === FILLING ===
  2              pints  fresh strawberries -- stemmed
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  kirsch
     1/2      teaspoon  orange zest
                        === SERVING ===
                        Vanilla ice cream
     1/2           cup  sweetened whipped cream

Prepare the shortcake: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt with a few on/off turns.  Add the chilled butter and process just until combined.  With the motor running, pour the cream through the feed tube, stopping just before the dough forms a ball.

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead, forming a smooth ball.  Do not overwork.  Roll out the dough to a round 3/4-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out 8 circles.  (Knead the scraps together and reroll as required.)

Arrange the 8 circles on the prepared baking tray, brush the tops with cream and sprinkle lightly with sugar.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cakes are golden and firm to the touch.  Cool on a wire rack.

Meanwhile, rinse and drain the strawberries.  Cut each berry into thick slices and toss with the sugar in a large mixing bowl.  Add the lemon juice, kirsch, and orange zest, and gently mix.  Set aside.

When ready to serve, split each shortcake in half and warm slightly.

For each serving, place the bottom half of the shortcake on a dessert plate.  Spoon about 1 cup of ice cream on the cake, arrange a scant cup of strawberries over and around the ice cream, and top with the remaining half of the cake.  Add a dollop of sweetened whipped cream on the side of the plate and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Strawberry shortcake is usually prepared with whipped cream, but I prefer serving it with ice cream.  The strawberries surrounding the cakes can be replaced with blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, or a combination of all of the above.

Wine Recommendation:  I love a slightly sweet dessert wine with my shortcake and nothing compares to a good Sauternes.  Ask your wine shop what they have and experiment.  My favorites include Chateau Suduiraut and Chateau Climens.

                               Sugar Dough

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pastry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/3           cups  cake or pastry flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream - (to 2)

In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour and sugar.  Add the butter and process until the texture resembles fine meal.

In a small bowl, whisk together the yolks and 1 tablespoon of the cream.  Scrape into the machine and process until a ball begins to form, using the additional tablespoon of cream, if necessary.  Remove the dough from the machine, and on a lightly floured surface, press down into a circle.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Use as needed.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 pounds or two 9-inch tart shells.

Comments:  Always make the pastry dough hours before using it, preferably the day before.  You will find the dough much easier to work with.  Quantities can be increased as desired, and then divided into portions for freezing.  Just remember to wrap carefully and seal well before freezing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  tangerine juice - (abt 18 tangerines)
                        Zest of 10 tangerines -- grated or minced
     3/4           cup  fresh lemon juice - (5 to 6 lemons)
                        Zest of 4 lemons
  1 1/2           cups  Simple Syrup -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  Mandarine Napoleon liqueur

In a bowl, mix together all the ingredients.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl.  Chill.

Freeze in an ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer's directions.

To make a surprising and special dessert, serve a scoop of Tangerine Sherbert on an almond biscotti with a few fresh berries.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts.

Comments:  A perfect light and refreshing dish for a summer evening or as an intermezzo for a grand dinner.  This is the perfect recipe for the beginner cook to make a gourmet dessert.  I would serve it on a biscotti with fresh berries.  And, of course, you can use other fruit such as lemon, lime or grapefruit if tangerines aren't available.

                 Tower Of Chocolate With Chocolate Mousse

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE BOX ===
  1              pound  bittersweet chocolate 64%
  6                     plastic pencil boxes - (3")
                        = (available at office supply stores)
                        === CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ===
     3/4           cup  bittersweet chocolate
  3               cups  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  raspberries

Chocolate Box:  Chop up the chocolate until very fine.  In a microwave safe bowl melt 2/3 cup (5 oz) of chocolate.  Place in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Remove and stir.  Continue this process at 10 second intervals until the chocolate is completely melted, and warm to touch of the lip (100 degrees).  Add remaining finely chopped chocolate.  Stir till smooth.

Fill one plastic box at a time with chocolate.  Turn upside down to release excess chocolate.  Place upside down on tray and continue filling the 5 other boxes.  This should only take 5 minutes.  While the chocolate is still soft, scrape excess bits away with a knife creating an even surface.  Continue with remaining boxes.  Place in refrigerator for 15 minutes.  Chocolate when exposed to a cold environment will retract from the plastic box.

Remove from refrigerator and gently tweak the box to gently conjoal the two apart.  Turn upside down and spoon in chocolate mousse.  Garnish with the raspberries.

Chocolate Mousse:  Chop up chocolate until very fine.  Place in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Remove and stir.  Continue this process at 10 second intervals until the chocolate is completely melted, and warm to touch of the lip (100 degrees).  Reserve.

Whip 1 cup of cream to soft peaks.  Have a whisk ready and add 1/2 of the heavy cream into the 100 degrees chocolate.  Work quickly or the chocolate will seize up.  Whisk cream with chocolate until homogenous.  Add the balance of heavy cream and gently fold to eliminate any white streaks.  Reserve till ready to use.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

        Warm Chocolate Cupcake With Decadent Soft Chocolate Center

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cupcakes                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  melted butter -- for brushing cups
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  10       tablespoons  butter - (5 oz)
  3              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Thoroughly brush the insides of six 8-ounce custard cups or ramekins with melted butter.  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.

In the top of a double boiler or medium heatproof bowl set over simmering water, melt chocolate and butter.  Remove from heat.

In large bowl of electric mixer beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar for about 5 minutes or until they are pale yellow, thick and creamy.

Fold egg mixture into chocolate mixture about one third at a time.  Gently fold in flour.  Pour mixture into prepared cups filling about two thirds full.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.  (The sides of the cakes should be firm but the centers will still be soft.)  Remove from oven and set aside to cool for about 10 minutes before unmolding.

Serve with sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice-cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you like chocolate you will die and go to heaven when you taste this dish for the first time.  Whenever I serve it I find the room goes quiet.  All you can hear are the oooohhhhs and aaaahhhhs.

Wine Recommendation:  If you want a taste that will perfectly reflect the richness of the chocolate in this dessert think about serving a small glass of Godiva Chocolate liqueur.  If you seek a contrast turn to Champagne, and pile decadence on top of decadence.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  pastry or cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  10 1/2        ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- cut small chunks
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (6 oz) -- room temperature
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  4                     eggs -- separated
     1/3           cup  whiskey or brandy -- warmed slightly
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking tray with parchment paper and set an 8- by 2 1/2-inch ring on it.  Wrap an 8-inch cardboard round with foil and set aside.

In a small bowl, sift together the flour and baking soda.  Set aside.

In a double boiler or a metal bowl placed over simmering water, melt the chocolate.  Keep it warm.

Meanwhile, with the paddle of an electric mixer, cream the butter until light.  Gradually add 1 cup sugar and continue to cream until fluffy.  (It is very important that this mixture is light and fluffy.)

Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, the whiskey or brandy, and the vanilla.  Stop the machine and scrape in the melted chocolate.  Continue to mix until well combined.  Remove the bowl from the machine and fold in half the flour mixture.  Fold in the remaining flour.

With a clean whisk and bowl, whip the egg whites untill soft peaks form.  Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar and continue to whisk until shiny and firm, but not stiff.  Stir 1/4 of the whites into the batter to lighten, then fold in the remaining whites.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake ring and bake for 1 hour.  Invert immediately onto the foil-covered cardboard round and run a sharp knife around the sides of the cake, loosening the cake from the ring.  Do not remove the ring from the cake.  Let cool completely on a rack.  Then, carefully lift off the ring.

Presentation:  Dust the cake with sifted powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream.

This recipe yields one 8-inch cake.

  2             ounces  smoked bacon - (abt three slices) -- cut into strips
  2             medium  onions - (1 lb) -- peeled, trimmed,
                        and diced
  2              large  carrots -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and diced - (3/4 cup)
  2              small  celery stalks -- trimmed, and
                        diced - (1/2 cup)
  1              small  celery root -- peeled, diced
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped
     1/4           cup  tomato paste

                        and chopped
  2                     fresh basil leaves - (to 3)
  2             sprigs  fresh flat-leaf parsley - (to 3)
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
     1/3           cup  sherry wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2 1/2         quarts  homemade or store-bought chicken stock -- heated

Cook over medium heat until the beans are tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally, adding more stock as necessary.

Discard the herbs.  Remove 2 cups of the beans and vegetables and pureÈ in a blender or food processor.  Stir the puree back into the soup and adjust the seasoning to taste.

                       White Chocolate Cheese Cake

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Sugar Dough -- (see recipe)
     3/4         pound  red or green delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered - (abt 2 med)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)
  1                cup  sugar
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese -- room temperature,
                        cut into small pieces
  4              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  4             ounces  white chocolate -- melted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to fit the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan.  Using the base of the springform pan as a guide, cut out a circle.  Transfer the circle to a pastry sheet, prick with a fork to prevent it from rising, and bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool, and with a wide spatula, place into the springform pan.  Set aside.

Meanwhile, caramelize the apples:  Cut each quarter of apple into 5 or 6 slices, each about 1/4-inch thick.  In a 10-inch skillet, melt the butter.  Add the apples and 1/4 cup sugar and over medium high heat, sautÈ the apples until lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  The apples will be very soft.  Allow to cool slightly.  Spread evenly over the baked crust.

In an electric mixer, using the paddle, beat the cream cheese until smooth.  Gradually add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and continue to beat until the mixture is not grainy and there are no lumps.  Stop the machine occasionally and scrape down the sides and under the paddle.  Add the eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla.  Scrape in the melted white chocolate and mix just until combined.  Pour over the apples.  (The filling will only reach about 1/3 up the sides of the pan.)  Tap the pan gently against the countertop to level.

Wrap heavy duty foil (or 2 layers of regular foil) tightly around the outside of the pan and set the pan in the center of a large baking dish.  Pour enough hot water into the larger dish to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.  Bake 55 to 60 minutes.  The center will still be little soft, but that's okay.  Remove the foil and cool on a wire rack.  Refrigerate until firm.  (At least 2 hours, up to overnight.)

Carefully remove the ring around the cheese cake.  Serve as is or, if desired, melt 4 ounces of dark chocolate and decorate the top of the cake.  To slice, dip a sharp knife into warm water and then cut the cake.

This recipe yields one 10-inch cake; 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This is a particularly rich cake, so cut into small slices and serve with a few fresh strawberries or raspberries.  I find the easiest way to melt the white chocolate is to break it up into small pieces and place it in a small cup or bowl.  Place the cup in the microwave oven, cover with a paper towel, and heat the chocolate, 30 seconds at a time, stopping the oven and stirring the chocolate, continuing to heat until melted.  It shouldn't take more than two or three 30-second periods.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a small glass of good late bottled port with cheesecake.  (Look for 'LBV' port in your wine store.)  The richness of the port is the perfect complement for the richness of this cheesecake.  Or, if you're celebrating something significant, think about buying a good vintage port and decanting it a few hours before dinner.  My favorites are Cockburns and Warre.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  8                     egg yolks
  10            ounces  white chocolate -- broken, or cut

     1/2           cup  Horlicks malt powder

In a large heavy saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a boil.

In a large stainless steel mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks.  Gradually pour the heated liquid into the bowl, whisking constantly.  Return to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon.

Meanwhile, in a small stainless steel bowl or the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate.  Whisk into the heated milk mixture.  Remove 1 cup of liquid and dissolve the malt powder in it.  Return to the saucepan and mix well.  Strain into a large mixing bowl and chill over ice cubes and cold water.

Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.

Place a scoop of ice cream on a large chocolate chip cookie and serve immediately.  Here, they are served with "Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies" (see recipe).

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Comments:  For anyone who remembers malted milkshakes back in the heyday of the milkbar this ice cream will strike an immediate chord.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  4               ears  white corn -- grated through
                        medium holes from a box grater -- (abt 2 cups)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              ounce  goat cheese
  3             ounces  mascarpone cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves -- minced
                        === AGNOLOTTI ===
  10                    sheets fresh pasta dough - (abt 6" by 12" 
                        Seminola or flour -- for dusting
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for eggwash
     1/2           cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2             sprigs  sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  butter
     1/4         ounce  white truffles

Filling:  In a medium skillet over medium high heat, bring the cream to a boil.  Reduce until only 1/3 cup remains.  Stir in the grated corn, salt, pepper and sugar.  Bring the mixture to a slow boil, stirring constantly.  Continue to cook until the mixture reduces and is thick enough to heavily coat the spoon.

Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.  Stir in the cheese and thyme and mix until well blended.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Place bowl over ice bath to allow filling to set.

Agnolotti:  On a lightly floured board roll out the pasta sheets as thinly as possible.  With a pastry bag or teaspoon, mound little heaps of filling about 1-inch apart in 2 rows.  Brush around mounds with eggwash.  Cut the pasta sheet in half between the rows, lengthwise.  Fold the dough over filling and squeeze dough together between mounds.  With a serrated pasta cutter, cut agnolotti.  Cut away excess dough lengthwise; there should be no more than 1/4-inch around the edges.  Cut individual agnolottis and pinch to seal.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  In a heavy skillet, add Chicken Stock, sage, and butter.  Boil until mixture emulsifies.  Season with salt and pepper.

Cook the agnolotti in boiling water until al dente, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and toss gently in the sage butter.

Serve in soup plates and shave white truffles on top.  To take advantage of the wonderful truffle aroma, cover each individual bowl of agnolotti with another plate.  When brought to the table, remove the top plate so that the truffle aroma escapes just as the guest takes the first bite.

This recipe yields 2 cups of filling; makes about 50 or 60 agnolotti.

Comments:  The first time people taste this dish when they visit Spago their eyes invariably close and their heads start to sway.  This is an absolutely unique and original pasta dish, one that will repay your effort (and investment in white truffles) a hundred times over when you see the look on your guests' faces as they take their first mouthful.

Wine Recommendation:  This dish demands that you select the best white wine in your cellar, preferably a great White Burgundy or one of the handful of outstanding Californian Chardonnays from winemakers like Peter Michael, Beringer Special Reserve, Kistler, Patz & Hall or Marcassin.  The partnership of rich, buttery Chardonnay and the pasta will seem like a marriage made in heaven.

Filling:  In a medium skillet over medium high heat, bring the cream to a boil.  Reduce until only 1/3 cup remains.  Stir in the grated corn, salt, pepper and sugar.  Bring the mixture to a slow boil, stirring constantly.  Continue to cook until the mixture reduces and is thick enough to heavily coat the spoon.

<DirT>
Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.  Stir in the cheese and thyme and mix until well blended.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Place bowl over ice bath to allow filling to set.

Agnolotti:  On a lightly floured board roll out the pasta sheets as thinly as possible.  With a pastry bag or teaspoon, mound little heaps of filling about 1-inch apart in 2 rows.  Brush around mounds with eggwash.  Cut the pasta sheet in half between the rows, lengthwise.  Fold the dough over filling and squeeze dough together between mounds.  With a serrated pasta cutter, cut agnolotti.  Cut away excess dough lengthwise; there should be no more than 1/4-inch around the edges.  Cut individual agnolottis and pinch to seal.

                          Wild Mushroom Risotto

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  peanut oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  7               cups  vegetable or Chicken Stock -- kept simmering
                        = (see recipe for Chicken Stock)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  wild mushrooms, such as shiitake,
                        cremini, oyster, or portabello -- stems reserved for
                        making stock
  1             medium  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the peanut oil.  Over medium-high heat, sautÈ the onion and garlic just to soften, stirring constantly, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the rice and continue to stir, using a wooden spoon, coating the rice with the oil and onion.

Deglaze with the white wine and cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often.  Pour in enough hot vegetable or Chicken Stock to cover, about 3 cups, and cook, stirring often, until the liquid is absorbed.

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the olive oil.  If the mushrooms are large, cut them into bite-size pieces and sautÈ over medium-high heat just to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.

Pour 3 cups of hot vegetable or chicken stock into the rice, turn the flame to high, and stir in the tomatoes.  Stir until almost al dente.  Stir in the mushrooms and the remaining 1 cup stock, as necessary.  Remember, the risotto should be creamy, not runny.  Remove from the flame and vigorously beat in the chilled butter and the Parmesan cheese until completely dissolved.  Stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Divide among 4 heated plates and serve immediately.  Pass around the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese for your guests to use as desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Making risotto requires your full attention.  Though the rice can be partially cooked in advance and cooled, the finishing process is so precise that the risotto cannot wait for your guests, but rather your guests have to wait for the risotto.

Wine Recommendation:  A lighter red wine like a Beaujolais or young Zinfandel goes particularly well with this risotto.  I like the wines of George Duboeuf, the 'King of Beaujolais', especially the Moulin-‡-Vent.  For Zinfandel you might like to see if you can find Dry Creek or Hayward Vineyards, both outstanding award-winners.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 9     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut small pieces
  1           teaspoon  instant espresso -- diluted in
  1         tablespoon  hot water -- (optional)
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped walnuts

Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter, or coat with vegetable spray, an 8-inch square baking pan.  Dust with flour, tapping out excess flour.  Set aside.

In the top of double boiler or medium heatproof bowl set over simmering water, combine chocolate, butter, and espresso (if desired), stirring occasionally until almost melted.  Turn off the heat, stir, and let melt completely.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Set aside.

In a large heatproof mixing bowl set over simmering water, whisk the eggs, sugar, and vanilla until the sugar dissolves.  Transfer to the large bowl of an electric mixer, on high speed, using paddle or beaters, beat until pale yellow.  Lower speed to medium, scrape in the chocolate mixture, and beat until well mixed.  On low speed, gradually add flour mixture and beat just until combined.  Add 1 cup of walnuts and again, on low speed, beat just until combined.  Scrape into prepared pan and sprinkle remaining  walnuts over top of cake.

Bake until edges of cake pull away from sides of pan and a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.  Cool on wire rack.

To serve, cut the brownies into 9 squares, each about 2 1/2 inches.  Serve as is or with softly whipped cream or ice cream of your choice.

This recipe yields about 9 brownies.

Comments:  These are sinfully dense brownies, fudgy and rich.  They can be made in a 9-inch round pan, if you prefer, cutting in wedges rather than squares.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  non fat milk
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (4 oz) -- melted
     1/2           cup  pastry flour
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sour cream, milk, and melted butter.

In a large bowl, sift together the pastry and all-purpose flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Make a well in the center, pour the egg-yolk mixture into the well, and whisk just enough to incorporate into the dry ingredients.

In a clean bowl, with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites until shiny and firm, but not dry.  Stir a little into the batter, then fold in the remaining whites.

Heat the griddle and butter lightly.  Over medium heat, using a 1/4-cup measure, pour the batter onto the griddle.  When each pancake is golden brown on one side, and small bubbles appear on the surface, turn with a wide spatula and brown the other side.  As the pancakes are cooked, transfer to a tray lined with a clean towel and keep warm in a low oven.

Arrange 3 or 4 pancakes on a warm plate.  Serve with warmed pure maple syrup or fruit syrup.  Garnish with a few slices of seasonal fruit and serve immediately.

To make fruit syrup, combine 1 part fruit (blueberries, sliced strawberries, or any other berry, sliced peaches, or plums) with 3 parts maple syrup and a little grated orange rind.  The fruit can be pureed, if desired.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields twelve 3 1/2-inch pancakes.

Comments:  At 4:00 A.M. every morning, the kitchen at Postrio in San Francisco sets up for breakfast that begins at 7:00 A.M.  The batter is the first thing they make and creates pancakes that are light and fluffy.

                      Wolfgang's Classic Apple Tart

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  12            medium  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2         pound  Puff Pastry -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  sugar -- for glaze

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Using half the butter, heavily coat the bottom and sides of a 10- by 3-inch round cake pan.

Arrange apples in the pan in a continuous circle (starting at the edge of the pan), piling one on top of the other -- the first row of apples with rounded-side down, the remaining rows with rounded-side up.  Sprinkle top with 1 cup sugar and dot with remaining butter.

Bake for 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake 1 hour longer, or until apples are soft and brown on top.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.

While apples are baking, prepare the crust.  Roll out enough Puff Pastry to form a 12-inch square 1/8-inch thick and place it on a buttered cookie sheet.  Cut out a circle a bit larger than the 10-inch apple-baking pan (a larger plate can be used to form the circle).  With tines of two forks, prick pastry over the entire surface to prevent curling during baking.  Bake in a 350 degree oven until lightly browned, 25 to 35 minutes.  Cool.

To assemble:  Set pastry shell on a serving dish and place it upside down over the apples.  Invert pan.  Apples are now on top of shell.  Sprinkle sugar liberally over the surface of the apples and place 3 to 4 inches from heat under a broiler until the sugar caramelizes.

Cut into wedges and serve warm with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  There are many versions of the classic French apple tart called tarte tatin.  This is my favorite.  Cooking the apples and puff pastry separately and combining them at the last moment ensures the pastry will be light and stay crisp.

Wine recommendation:  A dessert wine, something luscious, fat with fruit and not too cloying is my choice with apple pie.  My favorite is Bonny Doon's Vin de Glaciere from California.  Or perhaps a French Muscat from either Beaumes de Venise or Rivesaltes.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  There are many versions of the classic French apple tart called tarte tatin.  This is my favorite.  Cooking the apples and puff pastry separately and combining them at the last moment ensures the pastry will be light and stay crisp.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine recommendation:  A dessert wine, something luscious, fat with fruit and not too cloying is my choice with apple pie.  My favorite is Bonny Doon&apos;s Vin de Glaciere from California.  Or perhaps a French Muscat from either Beaumes de Venise or Rivesaltes.

                 Wolfgang's Classic Cheesecake From Spago

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTER CRUNCH CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped pecans or walnuts
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese -- room temperature,
                        cut into small pieces
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  3                     eggs

Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the butter crunch with your hands, until the mixture resembles very small pebbles.

Press the Butter Crunch Crust into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan and cover base completely.  Wrap heavy-duty foil (or 2 layers of regular foil) around the bottom and up the sides of the pan, pleating to tighten.  Bake crust for about 8 minutes until lightly golden.

Make the Filling:  Place the cream cheese, sugar, and salt in the large bowl of an electric mixer.  Using the paddle or beaters, on medium speed, beat until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides and under the beaters with a rubber spatula.  Turn the speed to high and continue to beat until nice and creamy.  Stop the machine, add the sour cream, rum, lemon juice, and vanilla, then , on medium speed, continue beating until well blended.  Add eggs and beat just until combined.  Scrape into the prepared springform pan and set the pan in the center of a larger baking pan.  Pour enough hot water into the larger pan to reach about halfway up the sides of the springform pan, but not above the foil.

Carefully place both pans in the oven and bake until the top is lightly golden and slightly firm in the center, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  (Cake will become firmer as it cools.)  Remove pans from the oven and carefully lift out the springform pan and place on a rack.  Remove foil from pan to help cool the cake.  When completely cool, refrigerate, covered, overnight.  (The cake should not be served until it is very firm.)

To serve, dip a long, sharp knife into warm water and run the knife around the inside of the springform pan, loosening the cake from the pan.  Remove the outer ring.  To cut into slices, dip knife into warm water as necessary.  Garnish each slice with berries of your choice.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cake; 10 to 12 servings.

Comments;  This is a creamy, rich, absolutely delicious cake.  The cheesecake should be baked in a bain-marie (water bath), created by placing one pan inside a larger pan and partially filling the larger pan with hot water.  When the cake is baked in a springform pan, layers of aluminum foil are wrapped around the pan to prevent water from seeping into the cake.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a small glass of good late bottled port with cheesecake.  (Look for 'LBV' port in your wine store.)  Or, if you're celebrating something significant, think about buying a good vintage port and decanting it a few hours before dinner.  My favorites are Cockburns and Warre.

                    Wolfgang's Favorite Chocolate Cake

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- cut small pieces
  4             ounces  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  5              large  eggs -- separated
  1              pinch  salt
     2/3           cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter, flour and line the base of a 10-inch round cake pan with parchment.

Combine chocolate and butter in a bain marie or in a bowl over simmering water.

Whisk together the egg yolks and all but 3 tablespoons of the sugar.  Stir melted chocolate into egg yolks until thoroughly combined.

With an electric mixer, on medium speed, beat egg whites and salt until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in the remaining sugar and continue to whip until egg whites are stiff but not dry.

Carefully fold chocolate mixture into egg whites.  Pour into prepared pan.

Bake for about 45 minutes.  Turn out onto a rack immediately.  As the cake cools, the center will sink and crack -- do not worry.

Dust the cake with powdered sugar and serve with unsweetened whipped cream.

This recipe yields one 10-inch cake.

Comments:  This is a flourless chocolate cake, one that tastes fabulously rich and decadent.  It requires nothing more than a sprinkling of powdered sugar and unsweetened whipped cream to make an exciting finish to a great meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Shortcake -- (see recipe for
                        Strawberry Shortcake)
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  peaches - (4 to 5 large)
  6               cups  mixed berries, such as raspberries
                        blueberries and blackberries
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Peach brandy, Kirsch or Grand Marnier
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === STREUSEL TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds
  2        tablespoons  quick cooking oats
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  cardamon
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream -- for glazing
                        shortcakes
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- for glazing
                        shortcakes

Prepare shortcake:  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.  Prepare shortcake dough as directed.  On a lightly floured board roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness.  Using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter cut out 12 circles re-rolling scraps if necessary.  Place on a baking tray; cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until ready to assemble cobbler.

Prepare filling:  In large pot of boiling water blanch peaches for about 1 minute.  Plunge into an ice-bath.  Remove skins, cut in half and remove pits.  Cut each half into 4 or 5 slices and place in large bowl.

Add mixed berries, brown sugar, lemon juice, Peach brandy and cinnamon.  Stir to mix thoroughly.  Spoon fruit mixture into a lightly buttered 13- by 9- by 2 1/2-inch baking dish.

Prepare streusel:  In a medium bowl, combine flour and sugar.  Using a fork, cut in butter until it resembles coarse meal.  Stir in remaining streusel ingredients.

Assemble cobbler:  Sprinkle prepared Streusel mixture over fruit filling in dish.  Place prepared shortcake circles on top.  Lightly brush shortcakes with heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar.

Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes or until shortcakes are golden brown and fruit filling is bubbling and thickened.  Remove from oven; allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.

Warm the cobbler, if made earlier in the day.  Serve with your favorite ice cream or softly whipped cream or just as is with a sprinkling of sifted powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  One can make apple pie all year round, but this is a recipe that demands ripe, delicious fresh fruit.  Make this only when peaches are at their best.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a wine that matches the fruit in this cobbler, a pink Champagne or a RosÈ.  I like Charbaut RosÈ and Moet & Chandon RosÈ Champagnes, and a Tavel or Provencal RosÈ for a still wine.  Of course, Champagne goes with just about every dessert so it's an easy choice.

                Wolfgang's Favorite Tomato Sauce For Pasta

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- peeled, trimmed,
                        and minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2             pounds  Roma tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  1                cup  homemade Chicken Stock -- (see recipe), heated
                        = (or use store-bought stock)
  6                     fresh basil leaves - (to 8) -- washed, dried
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut small pieces
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Over medium-high heat, sautÈ the onion until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook 1 minute longer.  Add the tomato paste, then the tomatoes, cook 2 or 3 minutes, and pour in the Chicken Stock.  Reduce until the sauce thickens, 15 to 20 minutes.  Strain into a clean saucepan.

Cut the basil leaves into a chiffonade and stir into the sauce.  Whisk in the butter, piece by piece, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Keep warm.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This sauce is extremely versatile.  It is delicious on pasta, and it can be used when making lasagna.  The recipe can be doubled or tripled, and if you like a sauce with texture, you can eliminate the straining in step 1.  Without the butter, it can be spread over pizza dough before layering with additional ingredients.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             packet  dry yeast
  1 3/4           cups  water
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1 1/2         pounds  bread flour
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        Extra virgin olive oil -- for brushing
                        === TOPPINGS ===
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
                        Fresh thyme leaves -- minced

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush a 15- by 11-inch baking tray with olive oil.  Set aside.

Using the mixer bowl, combine the yeast, 4 ounces of water and honey.  Stir together until yeast dissolves into the water.  Add 2 ounces of flour and mix to make a sponge.  Let rise in a warm place until double.

Gradually add the remaining flour, water, olive oil and salt.  Using the dough hook attachment, mix at medium speed to make a soft sough.  Beat for 2 minutes.  Turn off machine, scrape sides of bowl and allow dough to relax for 10 minutes.

Turn on mixer and continue to mix the dough for another 5 minutes at medium speed.  The dough will become velvety and elastic.  Transfer dough onto prepared baking tray.

Stretch the dough to fill the tray.  Cover loosely with clean kitchen towel and allow to rise at room temperature for about 20 minutes.

Uncover the dough and stretch to cover the entire baking tray.  Brush with olive oil and dimple with fingertips.  Sprinkle with kosher salt, pepper and thyme.  Let rise for 15 minutes.

Bake for 10 minutes, turn around and bake another 6 to 8 minutes, until golden brown and well-risen.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Focaccia is a wonderfully versatile bread.  This recipe creates light, fluffy bread that can be eaten by itself, with soup, split in half for sandwiches or even with salad.  The thyme and olive oil give it a Mediterranean flavor.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  5             pounds  Roma tomatoes -- cored, blanched,
                        peeled, seeded, and chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     bouquet garni - (made up of 2 sprigs each
                        rosemary, basil, and parsley, 1 sprig
                        oregano, 2 bay leaves, and 1 tbspn black
                        peppercorns)
  1             medium  onion -- finely diced
  1             medium  carrot -- finely diced
  1             medium  celery stalk -- finely diced
  2               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)

In a large saucepan, over medium-high heat, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add ground beef and sautÈ until browned, breaking up the large chunks of meat as they cook.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add shallots and garlic, continue cooking for about 3 more minutes or until shallots are soft.

Add red wine and deglaze pan, reduce until almost all liquid has been absorbed.

Add chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar and bouquet garni.  Bring mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer, covered for about 45 minutes, stirring frequently.

Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Add onion, carrot and celery.  SautÈ for about 4 minutes or until onion is translucent.

Add sautÈed vegetables along with chicken stock to meat sauce and simmer for another 30 minutes until meat sauce is rich and thickened.  Season to taste, if necessary.

Beef bolognese sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated in a covered container for 2 to 3 days in refrigerator or frozen for up to 3 months.

This recipe yields about 7 cups.

Comments:  An essential ingredient in classic beef lasagna but great with spaghetti, linguine or fettucine, this is perhaps the quintessential Italian sauce.

                Wolfgang's Special Spaghetti And Meatballs

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  4             slices  Italian bread -- crusts removed,
                        cut into small dice
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  2             pounds  lean ground veal
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     recipes Wolfgang's Favorite Tomato
                        Sauce For Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  spaghetti
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

In a medium skillet, over medium heat, melt butter.  Add onion and garlic, cook for about 5 minutes until soft, taking care not to brown onions.  Remove from skillet; set aside to cool.

In a large bowl combine bread and milk and set aside for about 10 minutes until all the milk is absorbed.

In a large bowl combine ground veal, sauteed onion, soaked bread, egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley, basil, thyme, salt, sugar and black pepper.  Mix to combine thoroughly.

With wet hands, roll meat mixture into large meatballs using about 1/2 cup at a time, making about 8 meatballs.  As they are formed, place on large plate or baking sheet.

In large saucepan over medium heat, heat tomato sauce until it is very gently simmering.  Carefully lower meatballs into simmering sauce; reduce heat and simmer, covered for about 45 minutes or until sauce has thickened and flavors have developed.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil; cook the spaghetti about 7 to 8 minutes or until al dente.

With a slotted spoon, remove meatballs from tomato sauce and transfer to a plate.  Remove 1 1/2 cups of sauce and keep warm.  Drain spaghetti and stir into remaining tomato sauce still in saucepan.  Stir to coat spaghetti thoroughly.

Twirl or mound spaghetti and tomato sauce into each of 8 hot serving bowls or plates.  Top with meatballs.  Drizzle with reserved 1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and freshly grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  What says Italian better than spaghetti and meatballs?  How about garlic and herb-flavored meatballs in my favorite tomato sauce?  The secret to these light and delicate meatballs is the addition of the milk-soaked bread to ground veal.

Wine Recommendation:  I like Chianti.  Especially with spaghetti and meatballs.  Forget those raffia-covered bottles of the past, Chianti now boasts some of Italy's greatest wines.  But you have to be careful.  Look for names like Antinori, Altesino, Villa Cafaggio, Fontodi, Terrabianca, E. Ricasoli-Firidolfi and Castello di Querceto.  Or ask your friendly wine shop proprietor for advice if the labels all seem too complicated.

Comments:  What says Italian better than spaghetti and meatballs?  How about garlic and herb-flavored meatballs in my favorite tomato sauce?  The secret to these light and delicate meatballs is the addition of the milk-soaked bread to ground veal.

Wine Recommendation:  I like Chianti.  Especially with spaghetti and meatballs.  Forget those raffia-covered bottles of the past, Chianti now boasts some of Italy&apos;s greatest wines.  But you have to be careful.  Look for names like Antinori, Altesino, Villa Cafaggio, Fontodi, Terrabianca, E. Ricasoli-Firidolfi and Castello di Querceto.  Or ask your friendly wine shop proprietor for advice if the labels all seem too complicated.
