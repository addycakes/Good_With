  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PASTRY DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cold, plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cold
  4        tablespoons  ice water - (to 6 tbspn)
                        === FOR TOPPING ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter, softened
  4        tablespoons  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  4             pounds  mixed Granny Smith, Golden Delicious,
                        and Empire apples - (abt 8 med)
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar

Make the pastry dough:  In a large bowl with a pastry blender or in a food processor blend or pulse together flour, sugar, salt, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water and toss with a fork or pulse until incorporated.  Add enough remaining ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing or pulsing to incorporate, until mixture begins to form a dough.

On a work surface smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions with heel of hand to slightly develop gluten in flour and make dough easier to work with.  Form dough into a ball and flatten to form a 1-inch-thick disk.  Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill 30 minutes.

Make the topping:  In a small bowl with your fingertips blend butter, brown sugar, and flour until smooth and blend in nuts.  Chill topping, covered.

Make the filling:  Peel and core apples.  Cut apples into 1/2-inch wedges and in a bowl toss with remaining filling ingredients to coat.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into a 15-inch round (about 1/8-inch thick) and fold into quarters for ease of handling.  Unfold dough in a well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet or 10-inch deep-dish (1 1/2-quart) pie plate, easing to fit and letting dough overhang rim of skillet or pie plate.  Spoon filling into shell and fold pastry overhang over filling, leaving center uncovered.  Bake pie in middle of oven for 1 hour (pie will not be completely cooked) and remove from oven.

Crumble topping over center of pie, breaking up any large chunks.  Brush crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake pie in middle of oven 30 minutes more, or until crust is golden and filling is bubbling.  Cool pie on a rack.  Serve pie warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

This recipe yields 1 (10-inch) pie.

                             Basic Pot Roast

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  boneless chuck pot roast -- neatly tied
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  1                cup  finely-chopped carrots
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
  2                     bay leaves
  2          teaspoons  thyme
  4               cups  beef stock
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4         tablespoon  butter -- softened

Pat roast dry and season with salt and pepper.  In a Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the roast and brown on all sides, about 15 minutes total.  Transfer the roast to a plate and pour out all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan.

Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan and cook over moderate heat, stirring until golden.  Place the roast back in the pan along with the bay leaves, thyme, and enough of the beef stock to come up 2/3 of the way up the beef.  Bring the pot roast to a simmer on top of the stove, skim, cover tightly, and set in the lower third of a 350 degree preheated oven.  Regulate heat so that the liquid remains at a gentle simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until the beef is tender.  Turn the roast over several times during its braising.

Transfer roast to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil to keep warm.  Skim off any fat from the surface of the liquid.  Strain the liquid.  To thicken the sauce slightly, bring the liquid to a boil.  For each cup of liquid, stir together 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon flour.  Whisk the butter mixture into the liquid.  Simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened.  Slice the pot roast and serve with the sauce and boiled new potatoes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  4                     onions
                        Leaves from 1 bunch of celery
  2        tablespoons  coarse salt

  1         tablespoon  mustard seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHOCOLATE CREAM ===
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  whole milk
  13            ounces  dark chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  Grand Marnier
                        === COCONUT TUILES ===
  3 1/4           cups  shredded sweetened coconut
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chocolate sauce

Prepare the chocolate cream:  The base of the chocolate cream is a crËme anglaise, which is poured over chocolate to make a ganache.

Pour half of the sugar into a small mixing bowl and set the remaining sugar aside.  Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined.  The mixture should be thick, smooth, and homogenous.

Pour the heavy cream, milk, and remaining sugar into a non-reactive 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil.  Temper the egg mixture with the hot mixture by carefully pouring about 1/3 of the hot mixture into the egg mixture.  Whisk immediately to keep the eggs from scrambling.  Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula.  The liquid will begin to thicken.

When it reaches 182 degrees on a candy thermometer and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it is finished and should be removed from the heat.  If you do not have a thermometer, you can tell that it is finished by using the following method:  In one quick motion, dip the spatula into the crËme anglaise and hold it down horizontally in front of you.  With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula.  If the trail keeps its shape, the crËme anglaise is ready.  If the trail fills with liquid, cook it for another minute and repeat the test.

The objective is to remove the crËme anglaise from the heat just before it boils.  If the crËme anglaise boils, the egg yolks will scramble.  If this happens, you can still use it if you mix it with a hand-held immersion blender, food processor, or a blender.  You will need a blade to liquefy the scrambled egg pieces.  Remove from the heat.

Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl and make a ganache by pouring the crËme anglaise over the chocolate in two or three additions.  Use a hand whisk to incorporate fully after each addition.  The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth.  Whisk in the Grand Marnier.  Place in the refrigerator to cool and set.

As the cream cools, the cocoa butter in the chocolate will harden and hold everything together.  The cream will also become more flavorful as it cools.  If you have time, make this a day in advance to give the chocolate flavor time to develop.  (The chocolate cream can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.)

Prepare the tuiles:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Combine the coconut, sugar, eggs, and butter in a medium-size mixing bowl and mix with a hand whisk until well combined.  Place a silicon mat on a baking sheet.  (If you do not have a silicon mat, you can use a nonstick baking sheet.)  Use a small offset spatula dipped in water to spread 4-inch circles of the tuile batter on the mat or baking sheet.  Place in the oven and bake until evenly light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Allow the tuiles to cool on a wire rack.

Assemble the Napoleon:  Place one tuile in the center of each plate.  Dip a large spoon in hot water and roll it through the chocolate cream to form a quenelle, or egg-shaped scoop, of chocolate cream.  Place the chocolate cream in the center of the tuile and repeat for the remaining plates.  Top with a second tuile and another quenelle of chocolate cream.  Top each with a third tuile.  Garnish the plate with the chocolate sauce and crËme anglaise.  You could also use fresh berries in season or chocolate shavings.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  6            squares  semisweet chocolate - (1 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  hot water or strong black coffee
  5                     eggs -- separated
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
                        Chocolate curls

Place chocolate and hot water in the top of a double boiler, set over simmering waster, and heat and stir until chocolate is melted.  Lightly beat yolks, add a little hot mixture, then stir back into pan and heat and stir over simmering water 1 to 2 minutes until no raw taste of eggs remains.

  3             pounds  collard greens
  1                cup  lean ham pieces
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              quart  hot water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- (optional)

Wash the collard greens, remove the stems and any bad spots, then chop or shred.  Cook the ham pieces slowly in the oil until crisp.  Add the water and simmer for about 10 minutes.  Remove the ham and set it aside.

Add the salt, sugar and collard greens to the pot.  Turn the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a boil.  Stir, then turn the heat to low.  Let the greens cook slowly, adding a little hot water if needed to keep them moist, until they are tender (about 45 minutes).  Mash a stem to check for tenderness.

Once the collards are tender, you can chop them smaller before serving if desired.  Ham may also be added to the greens, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  water
  1                     chicken (fryer) -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2           cups  self-rising flour
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  shortening

In a bowl, mix 2 teaspoons salt with 2 cups water.  Put in the chicken parts and let soak for 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain.

Mix together the flour, pepper and salt and batter the chicken by dipping the pieces in the flour mixture until they are coated on all sides, shaking off excess flour.

In a skillet, over medium heat, heat the shortening.  It should be at 350 degrees.  If the shortening appears too hot, remove the skillet from the heat and let it cool a little.  Brown the chicken on all sides, reducing the heat if needed as it cooks.  It takes about 20 minutes to fry chicken for it to be well done.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORTENING PIE DOUGH ===
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable shortening -- cold, cubed
     1/2           cup  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
  6               cups  thinly-sliced peeled cored Granny Smith ap
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cold, cubed
  1         tablespoon  milk or half-and-half

Make the dough:  In a food processor, pulse the flour and salt.  Blend in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add enough of the ice water to make a soft but not sticky dough, tossing with a fork.  Form the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, and dust with flour.  Wrap the dough in waxed paper and chill for at least 1 hour.

Roll the pastry so it will extend about 1 1/2 inches beyond the sides of a 9- by 9- by 2-inch pan.  Invert the pan on the pastry and cut around it, leaving a margin of about 1/2 inch.  The amount of pastry used will depend upon whether you prefer a thick or thin crust.  Roll the trimmings slightly wider.

Make the filling:  In a small saucepan bring the raisins and rum to a simmer.  Remove the mixture from the heat and let stand for 15 minutes, or until the raisins have absorbed the rum.

In a large bowl combine the sugar, flour, spices, salt, and lemon zest.  Add the apples and raisins and toss to coat well.  Sprinkle with the lemon juice and mound into the pan.  Dot with butter.  Place the crust over the apple mixture and moisten the edges to seal the dough.  Cut slits or a design on top to allow for the escape of steam, and crimp the edges.  Brush with half and half.

Bake in a 450 degree preheated oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake 25 to 40 minutes longer, depending on the variety of apples used.

This recipe yields 1 (9- by 9- by 2-inch) pie.

                        === FILLING ===
  3             pounds  McIntosh apples
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into bits

Make the dough:  In a food processor combine the flour and salt.  Add the butter and shortening and pulse until it resembles very coarse meal.  Add the Cheddar and pulse until it again resembles coarse meal.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl.  Add the yolk mixture, tossing with a fork until it forms a dough.  Add more cold water 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary.

Form the dough into a ball, flatten it into a disc, and dust with flour.  Wrap the dough in waxed paper and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Roll out half the dough 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface.  Fit it into a 9-inch (1-quart) glass pie plate and trim the edge, leaving a 3/4-inch overhang.  Chill the shell and the remaining dough while making the filling.

Make the filling:  Peel, core, and cut the apples into eighths.  In a large bowl toss together the apples, 3/4 cup of the sugar, the flour, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the salt, and the lemon juice until the mixture is combined well.  Transfer the filling to the shell and dot it with the butter.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Roll out the remaining dough into a 13- by 14-inch round on a lightly floured surface, drape it over the filling, and trim it, leaving a 1-inch overhang.  Fold the overhang under the bottom crust, pressing the edge to seal it, and crimp the edge decoratively.  Brush the crust lightly with the milk and cut slits in it with a sharp knife to form steam vents.

Bake the pie on a large baking sheet in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees and bake the pie for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until the crust is golden and the apples are tender.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  sherry wine vinegar
  3               cups  fresh orange juice
  4        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  6              large  oranges
  3                     boneless Muscovy duck breast halves -- (1 lb ea), thawed
                        if frozen
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4        tablespoons  grated orange peel

Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat untill sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, 8 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Mix in vinegar (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Add juice and shallots.  Boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.  Add broth; boil until reduced to 1 cup, 30 minutes.  Set aside.

Using small knife, cut off peel and white pith from 4 oranges.  Working over bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  (Sauce and oranges can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Using small knife, score duck skin (do not pierce meat) in crosshatch pattern.  Sprinkle duck with salt and pepper.  Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Place duck breasts skin down in skillet.  Cook until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes.  Turn duck and cook 2 minutes more and transfer to baking dish.  Bake in a 450 degree oven for 5 to 7 minutes, about 10 minutes longer for medium-rare.  Transfer to cutting board.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer.  Add butter and 1 tablespoon grated orange peel; whisk just until butter melts.  Drain orange segments and mix into sauce.  Set aside.  Slice duck breasts crosswise on diagonal.  Arrange on 6 plates.  Spoon orange segments with sauce alongside.  Sprinkle with remaining peel.

Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
  2 1/4           cups  milk
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2       teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

In a heavy medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt.  Whisk in about half of the milk to make a smooth paste and stir in the rest.  Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and begins to thicken, about 6 minutes.  Continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute longer, until smooth and very thick.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the chocolate, butter and vanilla, stirring until they are both melted.

Pour the pudding into 4 dessert bowls or one larger serving dish.  Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming on top and refrigerate until firm.  (This will take about 30 minutes for individual dishes, longer for the large bowl.)  Serve plain or topped with the optional whipped cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh okra
  1                cup  self-rising cornmeal
     1/2           cup  self-rising flour
  1                cup  vegetable oil

Rinse the okra and dry with a paper towel.  Cut the pods into 1/2-inch pieces, remove the tops.  In a bowl, mix together the cornmeal, flour, and salt.  Add the okra pieces to the bowl, stirring to coat with the cornmeal mixture, and then let sit for a few minutes.  Stir again.  When the breading clings to the okra, shake the bowl -- excess breading will go to the bottom.

Heat the oil over medium heat in a frying pan large enough to allow the okra room to cook evenly.  Spoon the okra out of the bowl and fry in the hot oil until browned all over, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Drain the okra on paper towels before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  russet or all-purpose potatoes
     1/4           cup  butter
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Peel the potatoes and cut in half.  In a medium saucepan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes until fork-tender, about 40 minutes.  Drain the potatoes well and return them to the saucepan.  Cook over low heat for 1 minute, tossing, to evaporate remaining moisture.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the cream and heat until just warm.  Using a potato ricer, mash the potatoes and garlic in the saucepan until they are broken up.  Stir in cream and butter mixture.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    kalamata, or other
                        brine-cured black olives
  2             ounces  soft mild goat cheese - (2 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  4                     boneless chicken breast halves -- with skin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Pit and thinly slice olives.  In a small bowl stir together olives, goat cheese, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste until combined well.  Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.

To form a pocket in chicken for filling:  Put a chicken breast half on a cutting board and, beginning in middle of 1 side of breast half, horizontally insert a sharp thin knife three fourths of the way through center, moving knife in a fanning motion to create a pocket.  Form pocket in remaining breast half in same manner.  Divide filling between pockets and spread evenly with a finger.

Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.  In a small heavy ovenproof skillet heat oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking and brown chicken, skin-sides down, about 2 minutes.  Turn chicken over and brown about 2 minutes more.  Transfer skillet to middle of oven and bake chicken until cooked through, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Ann Hodgman
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  nutmeg
     3/4           cup  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour
  4              large  eggs -- at room temperature
  4             ounces  grated Parmesan cheese -- at room temperature,
  1                cup  chopped ham
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for brushing
                        Grated Parmesan for sprinkling -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch pie pan.

Put the milk, butter, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a large, heavy saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the butter has melted and the mixture comes to a full boil.

Take the saucepan off the heat and add in the flour all at once, stirring hard with a wooden spoon.  Return the pan to the heat.  Stir vigorously and constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan.  This recipe will give you good arm muscles.  (There are recipes for making gougere in a food processor, but that involves a lot of sticky cleanup.  A saucepan and spoon are actually easier in the long run.)

Take the pan off the heat again (this time, turn off the burner).  Beat the eggs, 1 at a time, into the hot dough, stirring vigorously after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated and the dough is smooth.  The dough will be very stiff and thick.  Beat in the Parmesan cheese.  Fold in chopped ham.

Scrape/pour the dough into the prepared pie pan.  Brush with the egg-water mixture and sprinkle with the extra Parmesan cheese, if desired.  Bake for 50 minutes without once opening the oven door.  The gougere should be quite brown and puffy.

Without taking it out of the oven, make a few slashes in the top with a sharp knife; this will let out some of the steam in the center and help the gougere stay puffy once itís out of the oven.  Bake for 10 more minutes.

Serve the gougere hot, at room temperature, or cold.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        === GREEN TOMATO MARMALADE ===
  5                     green tomatoes
  1                cup  honey
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === SUGAR DOUGH ===
  4             ounces  butter
  9             ounces  flour
  2        tablespoons  water
  1 3/4         ounces  sugar
  1               dash  salt
  1                     egg yolk
     3/4           cup  toasted sliced almonds

  2                     eggs -- beaten

Cut the dough if you have to for them to look alike.

Brush some more egg on top, then, bake for 18 minutes in a preheated 400 degree oven.  Let them cool down, and sprinkle with powdered sugar and the sliced tomatoes on top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2          pint  assorted cherry tomatoes
  2             pounds  heirloom tomatoes -- different colors
                        and sizes
  1                     shallot -- diced fine
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Green and purple basil leaves -- chopped
                        Lemon cucumber slices -- (optional)
                        Torpedo onion slices -- (optional)

Stem the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half.  Core the larger tomatoes and cut them into slices or wedges.

For the vinaigrette, macerate the shallot in the vinegar with the garlic and a little salt.  Whisk in the oil.  Taste and adjust the acidity and salt as necessary.

Put the tomatoes in a shallow salad bowl or on a platter.  Season with salt and pepper, strew on the chopped basil leaves, and carefully dress with the vinaigrette.

Thin slices of peeled lemon cucumber and torpedo onion are wonderful additions to the salad.

For a more elegant tomato salad, slice perfectly ripe heirloom tomatoes and arrange them on a platter.  Season with salt and pepper, a splash of good Champagne, and a generous drizzle or extra-virgin olive oil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/8           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  olive oil

     1/2                cooked beet -- cooled, and
                        pureed in blender (1/2 canned whole
                        beet may be used)
                        ===SHRIMP PROVENCALE STUFFING ===
  12             large  raw shrimp
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red peppers
     1/2           cup  finely-diced carrots
     1/2           cup  finely-diced fennel bulb
     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  dry vermouth (Pernot may be substituted)
  1                cup  cream
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === THE HUSHPUPPIES ===
  2               cups  self-rising white cornmeal
  4          teaspoons  flour
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped basil
  1                     egg -- beaten
     2/3           cup  milk
  6               cups  peanut oil -- for frying
                        === THE SALAD ===
  18                    red oak leaf lettuce leaves -- washed
  18                    yellow chicory leaves -- washed
  18                    Belgian endive leaves -- washed
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped chervil

In a small bowl, place red wine vinegar, mustard, olive oil, salt and pepper.  Stir with a whisk until well combined, then add beet puree.

Shell and devein shrimp.  Slice them on an angle into 4 pieces.  In a medium skillet, heat butter and saute carrots, fennel, red pepper, shallots and garlic until vegetables are soft, but not browned.  Add shrimp and cook 3 minutes, turning them lightly until they are just opaque.  Add the vermouth, cream and tomato paste, then simmer for 4 more minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and add parsley.  Set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the 6 ingredients, blending well.  In deep fryer, heat peanut oil until it reaches 350 degrees on a deep-fry-thermometer.  Scoop up the mixture with an oval ice cream scoop to form 2-inch oval balls.  Carefully place 2 or 3 at a time into the oil.  Fry until golden brown, about 2 or 3 minutes.  Place on paper towel to drain.  When cool enough to handle, cut them in half and with tip of teaspoon carefully scoop out the inside cornmeal to form a hollow shell.  Set aside in warm place.

Arrange the 3 varieties of lettuce in center of 6 salad plates, and spoon vinaigrette dressing sparingly over them.  Warm the shrimp mixture.  Arrange 3 halves of the hollowed hushpuppies (per serving) on top of the lettuces.  Fill with warm shrimp mixture and sprinkle with chervil.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Shell and devein shrimp.  Slice them on an angle into 4 pieces.  In a medium skillet, heat butter and saute carrots, fennel, red pepper, shallots and garlic until vegetables are soft, but not browned.  Add shrimp and cook 3 minutes, turning them lightly until they are just opaque.  Add the vermouth, cream and tomato paste, then simmer for 4 more minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and add parsley.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a mixing bowl, combine the 6 ingredients, blending well.  In deep fryer, heat peanut oil until it reaches 350 degrees on a deep-fry-thermometer.  Scoop up the mixture with an oval ice cream scoop to form 2-inch oval balls.  Carefully place 2 or 3 at a time into the oil.  Fry until golden brown, about 2 or 3 minutes.  Place on paper towel to drain.  When cool enough to handle, cut them in half and with tip of teaspoon carefully scoop out the inside cornmeal to form a hollow shell.  Set aside in warm place.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the 3 varieties of lettuce in center of 6 salad plates, and spoon vinaigrette dressing sparingly over them.  Warm the shrimp mixture.  Arrange 3 halves of the hollowed hushpuppies (per serving) on top of the lettuces.  Fill with warm shrimp mixture and sprinkle with chervil.  Serve immediately.

                    Lazy Manís (Or Lazy Momís Lasagna)

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Ann Hodgman
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean ground beef
     1/2           cup  minced onion -- (optional)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced, (optional)
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  frozen cheese ravioli -- (not thawed)
  1                jar  spaghetti sauce - (14 oz)
  8             ounces  provolone -- sliced
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (abt 2 oz)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brown the beef with the optional onion, optional garlic, herbs, and salt and pepper in a large, ovenproof skillet (I use one thatís made of cast-iron).  When the meat is thoroughly cooked -- it will take 8 to 10 minutes -- drain off any fat and take everything out of the pan.

Now put the still-frozen ravioli into the pan, breaking them up if they are clumped.  Spread the ground beef mixture evenly over the ravioli, and ladle the spaghetti sauce evenly over the ground beef mixture.  Over medium heat, without stirring, cook until the ravioli is heated through and beginning to brown on the bottom -- about 10 minutes.

Take the skillet off the heat, lay the provolone slices over the ground beef mixture, and sprinkle the whole thing with the Parmesan.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  6        tablespoons  young soft goat cheese - (abt 3 oz)
  1              small  garlic clove -- peeled, minced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     thin slices prosciutto
  1 1/4           cups  fresh bread crumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1               head  romaine salad lettuce
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Rinse the chicken well and pat it thoroughly dry.  Place the chicken breasts between 2 pieces of waxed paper, and pound on them gently with a rolling pin or a heavy weight until they are about 1/4-inch thick throughout.

In a small bowl, mix together the goat cheese, garlic, and a generous amount of pepper.  Stuff the chicken breasts.  Lay a slice of prosciutto on top of 1 piece of chicken (if the prosciutto is larger than the chicken breast, trim to fit).  Place one-eighth of the goat cheese mixture on the top third of the prosciutto, and roll up the chicken breast to enclose the cheese.  Set it, seam-side down, on a clean counter or plate, and repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.  They will stay rolled quite easily without needing anything to secure them.

Place the bread crumbs in a shallow bowl or plate, and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Whisk the eggs in a large shallow bowl and set them next to the bread crumbs.

Dip each rolled chicken breast in the bread crumbs to coat it well, then in the beaten egg, then again in the breadcrumbs.  Use 1 hand for dipping the chicken in the crumbs, and the other for dipping into the eggs to minimize the amount of crumbs sticking to your fingers.

Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  When it is hot but not smoking, brown the chicken breasts turning them, frequently, until they are golden on all sides, about 7 minutes total.  (Do not overcrowd the pan.  Brown the chicken breasts in 2 batches if necessary.)  Remove them from the pan and arrange them in a single layer in an 8- by 14-inch enamel or ceramic baking dish.  Place the dish in the center of the oven and bake for 30 minutes.

Let cool and refrigerate.  Cut into 6 slices.

Whisk together oil, vinegar and mustard.  Season to taste.

Toss salad with vinaigrette.  Place on plate.  Arrange chicken slices on top of salad.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                Lion's Tooth Croutons For Boeuf Bourgignon

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  home-style white bread
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Slice each piece of bread on the diagonal into triangular pieces.  To shape each crouton, slice off the crust on one side of the triangle, then make a parallel slice, removing a corner of the bread.  Trim the remaining crust with three small cuts to make a wedge.

Spread the butter with your fingers in the center of a cookie sheet.  Press each wedge into the butter and rub gently to coat on one side, then turn it over, buttered-side up.  Arrange all the wedges on the buttered area of the sheet and place in the oven.  Toast the croutons for 8 to 10 minutes, until nicely colored and crisp.

To serve, pile the fresh parsley in a small mound.  Dip the point of the toasted wedge into the beef-stew sauce, then press the moistened end into the parsley to coat.  Arrange 2 croutons on every serving plate or bowl of stew.

This recipe yields croutons for 10 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     lobsters - (abt 1 lb ea)
  6               ears  sweet corn
  4                     bay leaves
  8             sprigs  thyme
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  3                     thick strips bacon -- julienned
  2              large  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  butter
  4          teaspoons  chervil leaves

Prepare the lobster:  Cook the lobsters in boiling salted water for 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly underdone.  Remove from the water and let cool slightly.  Remove the lobster meat from the shells, reserving the meat and the shells.  Coarsely chop the lobster meat.

Prepare the corn:  Remove husks from the corn and cut kernels off the cobs.  Reserve the corn, cobs, and half of the husks.

Make the bisque:  Place the lobster shells, corn cobs, husks, bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and peppercorns in a stockpot and add enough water to barely cover.  Simmer for 45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh sieve, discarding the solids.  Place the broth in a large saucepan and simmer over medium heat for 45 minutes, or until reduced to 1 1/2 quarts.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

In a small saucepan, place half of the corn kernels and the heavy cream.  Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the cream is reduced to about 1 cup.  Remove from the heat and puree until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cook the bacon over medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until the fat is rendered but not brown.  Remove the bacon from the pan and discard.  Saute the remaining corn, the potatoes, and onion in the bacon fat over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

Drain any fat from the pan, add the pureed corn mixture, and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, or until thick.  Add the lobster stock in small additions until the desired consistency is reached.  Add the lobster meat to the pan and whisk in the butter just prior to serving.

Ladle the soup into 10 bowls and sprinkle with the chervil leaves.  Top with freshly ground black pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              dozen  mussels
     1/4           cup  minced shallots - (2 to 3 shallots)
  1 1/4           cups  dry white
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- cut tablespoon size
  1              bunch  fresh spinach
                        Thin strips of red pepper -- for garnish

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil.  Wash mussel shells and add to boiling water.  Cover and cook until mussels open.  Discard any mussels that have not opened.  Drain the mussels and let cool enough to handle.  Pull them out of the shells and snip off the beard with a pair of scissors.  Set mussels aside and keep warm.  Discard half of the shells and reserve the others.

Clean the spinach, trim off any large stems and plunge into a fresh pot of boiling water 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain well.  When cool enough to handle, chop spinach coarsely.  Keep warm.

In a small skillet, combine shallots, wine and lemon juice.  Reduce over low heat until liquid is nearly gone (watch carefully as the reduction will scorch easily at this point).  Remove pan from heat and add one or two pieces of butter.  Stir steadily with a whisk until the butter is no longer in a solid form, yet not liquid either.  It should resemble the consistency of a thin mayonnaise.

Incorporate the rest of the butter, one or two pieces at a time, returning the pan to a low heat as necessary, retaining the same consistency.  If butter separates, the heat is too high; remove it from the heat and whisk rapidly to re-emulsify.  Set sauce aside and cover to keep warm.

To serve, place about 1 teaspoon of the warm spinach in each reserved half-shell and top with mussel.  Pour 2 teaspoons warm sauce over each.  If desired, garnish with slivers of red pepper.

This recipe yields 36 servings.

  1              pound  white unbleached flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  12            ounces  buttermilk - (to 14 oz)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         ounces  olive oil
                        Flour -- for dredging
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     veal shanks (preferably provini veal) -- cut to 5"
  5                     carrots -- cut 2" to 3" chunks
  1              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  8                     celery stalks -- cut 2" to 3" chinks
  3               cups  canned tomatoes -- chopped
  5               cups  veal or beef stock
  10            ounces  white wine (Pinot Grigio) -- or more to taste
  3                     tomatoes -- diced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus more
                        for seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus more
                        for seasoning
  1              pound  round or chuck steak -- cubed
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              large  celery rib -- thinly sliced
  2                     carrots -- very thinly sliced
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                can  stewed tomatoes - (16 oz) -- with their juices
  1                cup  red wine
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- (optional)

In a pie plate, combine flour, salt, and black pepper.  Lightly coat both sides of the meat with the seasoned flour; shake off any excess.  Reserve the remaining seasoned flour to serve into the gravy later.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet.  Add the meat and cook over high heat, turning once, for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until browned.  Remove with tongs or a fork to a plate.  (Depending upon the skillet size, this may need to be done in 2 batches.  Do not crowd pan, or the meat will not brown.)

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the drippings in the pan along with the onion, celery, and carrots.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for 2 minutes, until lightly browned.  Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and cook for about 10 minutes, until the vegetables are almost tender.

Add the garlic and sprinkle the reserved seasoned flour over vegetables.  Cook, stirring 1 minute.  Add oregano, tomatoes with their juices, and the wine.  Return the meat and any accumulated juices to the pan.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook over low heat for 20 minutes, or until the meat and vegetables are tender.  Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.  And stir in optional parsley if you desire.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Trim excess fat from flank steak and pound to approximately 1/8-inch thickness.  (This takes a few minutes, but it is important to the recipe.  Use a kitchen mallet or a heavy flat weight such as a wine bottle.)

Spread stuffing over meat, covering it completely.  Lay egg quarters down center, lenghtwise, and roll meat around stuffing without overlapping.  Tie with kitchen string at one-inch intervals to hold securely; if any stuffing escapes, carefully push back in.

Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1/4 cup of the reserved artichoke oil.  Heat oil and add stuffed beef roll to hot oil and brown on all sides.  Add wine, cover and cook over low heat for 45 minutes.  Turn beef roll over halfway through cooking.

When cooked, transfer meat to a serving platter and remove the string.  Slice and serve with the pan juices.  The Falso Magro roll is also terrific served on buffets, at picnics or even cold the next day.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

               Rosemary And Sundried Tomatoes Bread/Scones

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  white unbleached flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped rosemary
  2         tablespoon  chopped sun-dried tomatoes -- plus
  2          teaspoons  chopped sun-dried tomatoes
  12            ounces  buttermilk - (to 14 oz)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a mixing bowl sift together 1 pound flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, rosemary, and the sun-dried tomatoes.  Make a well in the center.  Pour most of the milk into the well.  Using one hand, mix in the flour from sides of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary.  The dough should be softish, not too wet and sticky.

When it all comes together, turn the dough onto a well-floured counter.  Wash and dry hands.  Knead lightly for 1 second, just to tidy it up, flip over.  Pat dough into a round about 1 1/2 inches deep and cut a cross into dough over the sides of the bread to let the fairies out, or shape dough into scones.

Bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn down the oven to 400 degrees for another 30 minutes or until cooked.  If in doubt, tap the bottom of the bread, it should sound hollow.   If making scones bake for 20 minutes in a 450 degree oven.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        Scones With Orange Butter

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Darina Allen
Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORANGE BUTTER ===
  6             ounces  butter
  3          teaspoons  grated orange zest
  7             ounces  confectionersí sugar -- sifted
                        === SCONES ===
  2             pounds  flour -- sifted
  1              pinch  salt
  3          teaspoons  baking powder - (heaping)
  2             ounces  granulated sugar
                        Zest of 1 orange -- finely grated
  6             ounces  butter
  3                     eggs
  2               cups  milk
                        === EGG WASH ===
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  milk
  2             ounces  granulated sugar -- for top of scones

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.

For the orange butter, put butter in a bowl and cream.  Fold in 3 teaspoons of grated orange zest.  Add confectionersí sugar to butter, and beat until fluffy.  Keep in refrigerator until ready to use.

For the scones, place sifted flour in a bowl.  Add pinch of salt, baking powder, granulated sugar and orange rind.  Mix to incorporate air.  Toss 6 ounces butter into flour and rub with fingertips until it resembles large flakes.  Make well in the center.

Whisk together 3 eggs and 2 cups milk and pour mixture into the center.  With fingers of your "best" hand outstretched and stiff, mix in a full circular movement from the center to the outside of the bowl.  This takes just seconds.

Sprinkle some flour on the work surface, turn dough onto floured board.  Pat dough into a round about 1-inch thick.  Stamp into scones with a cutter.

Whisk together egg and milk.  Brush tops with egg wash and dip tops only in granulated sugar.  Put onto a baking sheet and bake in preheated 475 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden on top.

This recipe yields 18 to 20 scones (using a 3-inch cutter).

                   Seasonal Salad With Herb Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Alice Waters
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  red wine or sherry vinegar -- or a combination
  1              small  garlic clove -- peeled
                        Salt -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6              large  handfuls salad greens - (abt 3/4 lb)

Measure the vinegar into a small bowl.  Crush the garlic clove and add it to the vinegar, along with 1/2 teaspoon salt.  After 10 minutes or so, whisk in the olive oil and a little freshly milled pepper.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Make the vinaigrette no more than a couple of hours before serving.

Pick over the salad greens, discarding any tough outer leaves, or any that are wilted or blemished.  (If you are using young head lettuces, trim the root ends with a sharp paring knife to free the leaves.)  Fill a large basin with cold water and gently submerge the greens, allowing sand and grit to sink to the bottom.

Lift the lettuces from the water and drain them in a colander, then dry them in a salad spinner.  Wrap the leaves in clean cotton toweling and refrigerater in an airtight container.

To serve, put the greens in a wide salad bowl and season with a small pinch of salt.  Remove the garlic clove, whisk the vinaigrette, toss the greens lightly with just enough dressing to make the leaves glisten.  (Your hands make the best salad-tossing tools.)  Serve immediately with garlic toast or croutons.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2              small  heads fennel
  6                     tiny artichokes
  4              small  carrots

  8              small  asparagus spears

  1                     handful peeled fava beans
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  10                    salt-packed anchovies - (to 12)
  6                     whole cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
                        A few drops red wine vinegar
                        Lemon zest -- (optional)

Wash the vegetables in a large bowl of cold water and blot dry.  Trim the fennel of any stringy layers, and slice thinly crosswise.

Peel the outer leaves of the artichokes to reveal the pale green hearts, and slice into thin wedges.

Peel the carrots and slice lengthwise.  Cut the cauliflower into thin slices, or break it up into small florets.

Separate the leaves of the Belgian endive and radicchio or Treviso.  Snap off and discard the tough bottom ends of the asparagus and slice the spears into quarters lengthwise.

Cut the turnips and radishes into quarters, leaving the tops attached, or leave whole if they are small.  Clean the spring onions and slice in half lengthwise.

Sprinkle everything lightly with sea salt and arrange the vegetables on a platter, tossing them together to create a colorful display.  Scatter the fava beans over the top.

Rinse and fillet the anchovies.  In a mortar, pound the garlic to a paste with a little salt and pepper.  Add the anchovies and pound until roughly mashed.

Warm the olive oil and butter over medium-low heat.  Add half the anchovy mixture, the red wine vinegar, and lemon zest, and gently simmer for 2 minutes.

Stir in the remaining anchovy mixture, taste for salt and pepper, and transfer the sauce to a warmed bowl or individual ramekins.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  2               cups  beef stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             pounds  beef eye of round
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped pancetta
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  parsley leaves - (tightly packed) -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  5               cups  red wine
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, crushed

Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1 cup of hot stock until softened, about 30 minutes.  Strain the liquid through a coffee filter or a sieve lined with a double layer of cheesecloth.  Trim any hard bits from the mushrooms.  Set aside the mushrooms and liquid separately.

Season the beef with salt and pepper.  In a large casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Brown the beef on all sides, about 15 minutes total.  Transfer the beef to a plate.  Pour off browning fat.

Add pancetta, onions, carrots, and celery, stirring, until they are golden.  Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Stir in bay leaves, rosemary, parsley, and tomato paste.  Add the wine and simmer until it is reduced by half, about 20 minutes.

Add the beef, tomatoes, porcini mushrooms, mushroom liquid, and enough beef stock to come 2/3 up the side of the beef.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook at a gentle simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until the meat is tender.  Turn the roast every 30 minutes or so.

Transfer the meat to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.  Skim off any fat from the surface of the liquid.  Strain the liquid, pressing on the solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard the solids and return the strained sauce to the pot.

Bring to a boil and let cook uncovered for a few minutes to further reduce and thicken the liquid.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Slice the roast and serve with the sauce and soft polenta.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  sun-dried tomatoes
  1                cup  water
  2 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  arborio rice
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Finely chopped fresh parsley leaves -- if desired

In a small saucepan simmer the tomatoes in the water for 1 minute, drain them, reserving the liquid, and chop them.  In a saucepan combine the reserved cooking liquid and the broth, bring the liquid to a simmer.

In a large saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderately-low heat, stirring, until they are softened, add the rice, stirring until each grain is coated with oil, and stir in the tomatoes.  Add 1/2 cup of the simmering liquid, stirring until absorbed.

Continue adding the liquid, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each portion be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is tender but still al dente.  (The rice should take about 17 minutes to become al dente.)  Stir in the Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle the risotto with the parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     elephant heart plums -- skins removed,
                        and pitted
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  creme fraiche
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
     1/4           cup  simple syrup -- (equal parts
                        warm water and sugar heated until
                        the sugar is dissolved)
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  rosemary leaves
                        === CREAM CHEESE DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  cream cheese -- cold, and
                        cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  butter -- cold, and
                        cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  flour
                        === MAPLE MASCARPONE CREAM ===
  1 1/2            cup  Mascarpone cream
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  maple syrup

Make the tart shells:  In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, butter, and flour until it just comes together.  (There should still be streaks of cream cheese.)  Remove the dough from the bowl, pat into a disc, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  Roll out the dough into 1/8-inch thickness and cut into 6 (3-inch circles).  Refrigerate on a parchment-lined sheet pan for 15 minutes.

Make the filling:  Dice 2 of the plums and toss together with 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, the cinnamon, and creme fraiche.

Assemble the tarts:  Brush the dough lightly with the beaten egg and spoon a generous tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle.  Lift up the edges of the tart and pinch 3 points of the tart about halfway to the filling to form the sides of the crust.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Brush the edges of the crust with egg and sprinkle lightly with the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar.  Pinch the dough again to make sure it is tightly sealed and freeze for 10 minutes.

Remove the tarts from the freezer and immediately bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Let cool slightly and dust with confectioners' sugar.

Make the compote:  Dice the remaining 2 plums and toss with simple syrup, lemon juice, and rosemary.  Warm over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until the plums are tender.

Make the Maple Mascarpone Cream:  Whip the Mascarpone and heavy cream together until medium stiff peaks form.  Add the maple syrup and whisk together until smooth.

Plate the tarts:  Place 1 spoonful of plum compote in the center of each plate.  Place a tart in the center of each plate and spoon some of the Maple Mascarpone Cream around the tart.

This recipe yields 6 tarts.

                        Turkey-And-Cheese Roll-Up

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Ann Hodgman
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- divided
  1              large  onion -- (optional), chopped 
     3/4           cup  raw rice
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley -- (optional)
  10                    sheets filo dough -- (read box carefully
                        for defrosting instructions)
  4             ounces  smoked turkey -- cut fine strips
  4             ounces  Swiss cheese -- grated
  4             ounces  cheddar -- grated

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lavishly grease a cookie sheet or (preferably) cover it with parchment paper.

Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan.  Add the optional onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until itís translucent.  Add the rice and chicken broth.  Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, or until the rice had absorbed all the broth.  Cook to lukewarm, then season to taste with pepper and stir in the optional parsley.

Meanwhile, melt the rest of the butter in a small saucepan.  Put 1 filo sheet in front of you and brush it lavishly with melted butter.  Repeat this brushing process, using plenty of butter, stacking the sheets, until all the sheets have been used.

Carefully spread the cooled rice over the filo sheets, leaving a 2-inch border all around.  Top the rice with the turkey and the turkey with the cheeses.

Slide your hand under a short end of the filo stack and lift up approximately 3 inches of it.  Fold this over once, as if you were making the first fold in a business letter.  Fold the long sides over to seal the filling.  Continue folding until the strudel is all rolled up.

Place the strudel on the cookie sheet seam-side down.  With a sharp knife, make several slashes in the top to let out the steam.  Bale for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the strudel is well browned and crisp-looking.  (Some of the filling may leak out onto the pan, but donít worry about that.)  Let the strudel stand for 5 minutes before you slice it with a sharp knife.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  white unbleached flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  12            ounces  buttermilk - (to 14 oz)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a mixing bowl sift together 1 pound flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  Make a well in the center.  Pour most of the milk into the well.  Using one hand, mix in the flour from sides of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary.  The dough should be softish, not too wet and sticky.

When it all comes together, turn the dough onto a well-floured counter.  Wash and dry hands.  Knead lightly for 1 second, just to tidy it up, flip over.  Pat dough into a round about 1 1/2 inches deep and cut a cross into dough over the sides of the bread to let the fairies out, or shape dough into scones.

Bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn down the oven to 400 degrees for another 30 minutes or until cooked.  If in doubt, tap the bottom of the bread, it should sound hollow.   If making scones bake for 20 minutes in a 450 degree oven.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  potato-cooking water
     1/2           cup  mashed potato
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  6        tablespoons  butter -- softened, plus
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
  1                     egg
  4               cups  flour  - (to 4 1/2 cups)
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
                        === ORANGE ICING ===
  1                cup  sifted powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  shredded orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1         tablespoon  fresh orange juice - (to 2 tbspns)
                        === WHITE ICING ===
  1                cup  sifted powdered sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1         tablespoon  milk - (to 2 tbspns)

Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large mixing bowl and let stand a few minutes to dissolve.  Add the potato water, mashed potato, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, butter and egg and beat well.  Add 2 cups of the flour and beat until smooth.  Add enough of the remaining flour to make a manageable dough, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute or 2.  Cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.  Let rest 10 minutes.

Resume kneading for about 8 to 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Sprinkle on a little more flour as necessary to keep dough from being too sticky.  Place in a large greased bowl, cover and let rest until double in bulk.

Punch dough down.  On a floured surface, roll dough into a 14- by 8-inch rectangle.  Spread dough with 1/2 cup softened butter.  Mix 2/3 cup sugar with 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon in a small bowl.  Sprinkle over butter.  Roll up from long sides like a jelly roll.

Cut into 12 equal pieces.  Arrange, cut-sides up, in a greased 9- by 13-inch pan.  Cover pan loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk approximately 30 to 40 minutes.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until done.  Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.  Drizzle with both icings 1 at a time.

For the Icings:  Combine all ingredients to the individual icing of drizzling consistency.

This recipe yields 12 servings.
