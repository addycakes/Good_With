                        Seasonal fresh fruit, in contrasting
                        colors, washed,
                        pitted, peeled, or stemmed as necessary,
                        for example:
  1              whole  mango
  3                     fresh figs
  1             carton  fresh raspberries
                        Green grapes, on the stem
  1                     or 2 whole oranges -- peeled, and
                        sliced into wheels
                        (any other fresh, attractive fruit)

                        and pansies, for garnish

Make a "porcupine" of mango.  Cut remaining fruit in slices or pieces as needed; not bite-size, but large distinct pieces.  Halve or quarter fresh figs.  Leave raspberries whole, and grapes on the stem.  Arrange attractively on large platter.  Garnish with fresh mint and pansies.

         Bell Peppers Stuffed With Green Chile, Corn, And Hominy

Recipe By     :Crescent Dragonwagon
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  Sweet Pepper Oil -- (left over from
                        prepping peppers)
  1                     onion -- diced
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seed
  2               cups  corn kernels, either thawed frozen
                        kernels, or fresh cut from 3 to 4 cobs
     1/2           cup  white posole (hominy) corn, canned -- well drained
  1         tablespoon  diced, canned green chile or charred,
                        peeled, seeded Poblamo chile
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed
  2        tablespoons  vegetable stock, if you have it on hand,
                        or water, if you don't
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3              large  green bell peppers -- prepared for stuffing

Over medium heat, in oil-sprayed or nonstick skillet, heat the oil.  Add onion and saute about 2 minutes, or until onion is starting to give off an aroma.  Add cumin seed, and saute another 2 to 4 minutes, or until onion is beginning to wilt and seeds are fragrant.  Add corn, and stir another 3 minutes.  Add posole, green chile, garlic and 1 tablespoon of vegetable stock. 
Dissolve cornstarch in the remaining tablespoon of stock, and stir into the skillet.  The filling will quickly thicken just enough to stick together somewhat, as if glazed.  Taste for seasoning, and pile into pepper halves. 
This recipe yields 6 stuffed pepper halves. 
How to Prepare a Bell Pepper for Stuffing:  First, I never cut off the top and scoop down into the pepper, making a single, upright, tall, deep stuffing vessel; to me, this method gives too high a percentage of filling to pepper.  And, because so little filling surface is exposed to the oven heat, the result's too soggy for me. 
Instead, start by halving large green, red, yellow, or purple sweet bell peppers vertically, right down the middle through the stem.  The vertical halving, in addition to solving the sog problem, makes for a pretty presentation on the plate and also means you can get two servings from a single pepper (although if you're using the pepper as a centerpiece instead of a component, you might consider both halves to be one serving). 
With a paring knife, cut out any residual chunk of white fiber and remove any seeds or the miniature internal peppers that are sometimes formed. 
Pam a skillet, and film the surface with olive oil, 2 or 3 tablespoons.  Turn the heat up and get the skillet quite hot.  Place the peppers, cut sides down, in the hot oil.  There will be great sizzling and carrying on; ignore it.  Let the peppers sear about 3 to 4 minutes.  Then, using a pair of long handled tongs, flip the peppers over and let sear another 3 to 4 minutes.  What you want to do is soften the peppers slightly, not much, just enough to take the raw edge from them and brown them in spots. 
Remove the peppers from the oil, and immediately drain them on paper towels, wiping them well to remove any traces of oil.  Then, once the oil has cooled, pour it into a bottle or jar.  You'll notice it has taken on both the color and fragrance of the peppers.  Use this Sweet Pepper Oil in the filling recipe, and hoard the leftovers, refrigerated, for a nice note in any stir-fry that contains peppers, or as an addition to salad dressings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     beef shortribs - (2" high, 6 oz ea)
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
  2             ounces  soy sauce
  3             ounces  dark beer
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1              slice  ginger, 1/4"
                        Zest of one lemon
  4                     garlic cloves
                        === TO BRAISE ===
  1              ounce  olive oil
  3               cups  veal stock
                        === CR»ME FRAICHE WITH HORSERADISH ===
  3             ounces  horseradish -- peeled, sliced
  4        tablespoons  crËme fraiche
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  frissee salad -- washed, and
                        soaked in ice water
                        === FOR THE RIB-STEAK ===
  6             ounces  boneless ribsteak -- all fat removed,
                        trimmed into rectangular shape
  1              ounce  olive oil
                        === FOR THE ROOT VEGETABLES ===
     1/4           cup  large-diced carrots
     1/4           cup  large-diced turnips
     1/4           cup  large-diced zucchini
  2             sprigs  thyme
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Combine all ingredients and marinate the shortribs for 24 hours, turning 2 or 3 times.  Remove the ribs from marinade.  Sear in 1 ounce olive oil on the 3 sides without the bone. 
Transfer the shortribs and marinade to a suitable size baking dish and add the veal stock to cover the meat.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake in a 325 degree oven for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender.  Remove the meat from the liquid and strain the sauce, discarding the solids.  Reduce the liquid by one third until thickened to a sauce consistency.  Hold warm. 
CrËme fraiche with horseradish:  Pulse the horseradish in a bar blender and add the crËme fraiche.  Let steep overnight.  The next day, pass through a chinois, season with salt and pepper.  Discard solids.  In a small mixing bowl, combine the crËme fraiche with a few drops of the lemon juice.  Add the frissee and mix well, season with salt and pepper. 
For the Ribsteak:  Season the steak with salt and pepper.  Sear in a hot sautÈ pan in the olive oil for 30 seconds on each of the four sides, until well browned but rare in the middle.  Transfer to a wire rack to rest the meat. 
For the Root Vegetables:  Cook the vegetables over medium heat in the olive oil, adding the carrots and turnips first, zucchini last.  Add the thyme and garlic and cook until the vegetables are lightly caramelized.  Remove garlic and thyme and hold warm. 
Assembly:  Slice the ribsteak into fourteen open slices, seven for each plate.  Put one shortrib on each plate, discarding any excess fat.  Divide the frissee salad between the two plates, and place between the two meats.  Sprinkle the root vegetables over the ribs.  Sauce both plates using the reduced braising liquid. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dried white beans - (12 to 14 oz) -- rinsed, picked over,
                        and soaked overnight
  8              ounce  length of Chorizo or other spicy sausage
  3        tablespoons  pure olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, sliced thin
  2                     Scotch bonnet chilies -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
  2                     poblano chilies -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and medium diced
  1                cup  minced red onion
  3             quarts  chicken stock or water
     1/2         pound  beef chuck steak -- left in one piece,
                        rubbed with salt and pepper
  1                     smoked pork hock or ham bone
  2                     bay leaves -- broken
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red potato -- scrubbed, and
                        diced into large bite-sized pieces
  1                     turnip -- peeled, and
                        diced into large bite-sized pieces
  2               cups  collard greens - (packed) -- stems cut out,
                        washed, and cut in shreds
                        More salt and pepper to taste

Heat a large, heavy soup pot on medium heat and add the olive oil.  Once it is warm lay the chorizo sausage in the pan and turn it as necessary to brown.  Pierce the sausage casing and cook until done.  Allow to cool a few minutes and then place it in the refrigerator to firm up. 
Now working in the same soup pot add the butter.  Heat on medium heat and allow the butter to melt.  Now add the garlic, chilies and red onion.  Allow to cook 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Drain the soaking beans and add them to the pan.  Stir well.  Add the stock, the hock (or bone) and bay leaves.  Turn up the heat and bring it to just under a boil, skimming as necessary.  Lower the heat to low and add the beef chuck.  Do not cover.  Stir occasionally, taking care to not let the beans stick to the bottom. 
When the beans are almost tender, season them with salt and pepper.  Now add the potato, turnip and collards.  Cook until the potato is just tender, (about 45 minutes).  Cut the chorizo into 1/2-inch rounds and add it to the soup.  Remove the beef and allow it to cool on a plate.  Turn off the soup.  Shred the beef apart and add it back to the soup.  Season to taste and serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings, (12 to 14 cups).

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  poussin
  2        tablespoons  five spice-salt mix (2:3)
  1                cup  molasses
  1                cup  Chinese black vinegar
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  honey
                        Blanching water
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  4                     scallion brushes
                        === BLACK BEAN SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  Chinese black beans
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Shaoxing rice wine
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                cup  canola oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === WATERCRESS AND BLACK BEAN NOODLES ===
     1/2         pound  wonton noodles -- blanched, refreshed
  1                     red onion -- finely sliced
  1                cup  sliced shiitakes
     1/2         pound  watercress
     1/4           cup  black bean sauce -- from above

Rub the cavity with the salt mix.  Quickly dip each poussin in the blanching water 2 times.  Heat the molasses, vinegars and honey to boiling.  Dip each poussin three times in this liquid.  If possible, hang dry for at least 2 hours. 
Roast the poussin at 325 degrees for 14 minutes.  The chicken should still be rare with a light golden skin.  Deep fry at 375 degrees until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. 
Black Bean Sauce:  Saute first 3 ingredients.  Dissolve sugar with vinegar and Shaoxing.  Deglaze saute with liquid.  Let cool completely.  In a food processor, mix above with Dijon and sugar.  Slowly add oil to emulsify.  May need to add a little ice water. 
Watercress And Black Bean Noodle Stir-Fry:  In a wok or large saute pan, caramelize onions and shiitakes.  Add watercress to wilt only, then add noodles and black bean sauce.  Check for seasoning. 
Serve whole bird on a pile of noodles.  Garnish with scallion brushes. 
This recipe yields 4 portions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sesame Raisin Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
  4                     to 5 small, or 2 to 3 large, fresh beets
                        Oil or Pam
  1              pound  mixed hearty lettuce greens -- washed very well,
                        dried, and torn into pieces (include
                        romaine,
                        redleaf lettuce, and arugula)
  1              small  red onion -- peeled, and
                        sliced crosswise paper-thin
  3             ounces  good-quality blue cheese, preferably
                        Maytag
  1              crisp  Granny Smith Apple -- cored, not peeled,
                        and cut tiny matchstick-sized julienne
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces

Make Sesame Raisin Vinaigrette and transfer part of it, using funnel, to a squeeze bottle with a small opening (about 1/6 of an inch) at tip.  Set aside. 
Wash and scrub beets, leaving whole and with peel on.  Wrap beets in oiled or Pammed foil, and bake at 350 degrees until tender when pierced but not mushy, about 45 minutes for small beets to 1 1/2 hours for very large beets.  Let beets cool.  Rub off skins and dice into 1/2-inch cubes. 
Just before serving, get out chilled serving plates, and mound with prepared salad greens.  Scatter the diced beet over the greens, then, using dressing in plastic squeeze bottle, quickly squeegee a ribbon of dressing over the greens, 
Scatter onion, cheese, apple, and walnut atop the salad, and serve at once, passing additional dressing at table. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

         Dairy Hollow House Skillet-Sizzled Buttermilk Cornbread

Recipe By     :Crescent Dragonwagon
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  stone-ground yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  unbleached white flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/3           cups  buttermilk -- plus a bit
                        (or 1 cup plain yogurt mixed with 1/4 cup
                        water)
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  mild vegetable oil, such as
                        corn, canola, or peanut oil
                        Pam spray
  2        tablespoons  butter

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and sugar.  (If baking powder or soda appear at all lumpy, sift them in).  Stir well to combine. 
In a small bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and oil. 
Spray a 9- to 10 1/4-inch skillet with Pam (our skillets are 10 1/4 inches; this size is called a Number 7).  Put the skillet on over medium heat, add butter, and heat until the butter melts and is sizzling seriously.  Tilt the pan to coat the sides of the skillet. 
As the butter's melting, quickly pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and, using a wooden spoon, stir the wet and dry together with as few strokes as possible only as many as are needed to combine the two.  Don't beat it; don't smooth it out.  Scrape the batter into the hot, buttery skillet -- if you've gotten it hot enough it will sizzle as it goes in -- and pop it in the oven immediately.  Bake until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes.  Serve, hot, cut in wedges. 
This recipe yields 1 skillet, or 8 large wedges.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Oil spray
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- cut vertically
                        into crescent-shaped slivers
     1/4           cup  unbleached white flour
  3 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
     1/4           cup  nutritional yeast
     1/4           cup  Tamari/Shoyu soy sauce
  1                cup  hearty, full-bodied, tannic red wine,
                        such as a Cabernet, Barolo, or Barbaresco
  1         tablespoon  Umeboshi vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        A major grinding of fresh black pepper,
                        (1/2 to 1 teaspoon or so)
  1                cup  canned diced tomato in tomato puree
  8                     garlic cloves - (to 10) -- peeled, quartered,
                        or thickly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6                     dried shiitake mushrooms - (to 8) -- broken into quarters
  1            package  seitan - (8 oz) -- well drained, and
                        diced into stew beef size squares,
                        (1" to 1 1/2" or so)
  4              small  potatoes -- scrubbed, peel on,
                        cut in large pieces
  2                     carrots -- scrubbed, peel on,
                        sliced in 1/2" rounds
  1                     parsnip -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced in 1/2" half-rounds
  2               cups  green beans -- stemmed, and sliced
                        into 2" to 3" long pieces
  1                     zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced into 1/2" half-rounds
                        Minced Italian parsley -- for garnish, (optional)

If using a conventional Dutch oven, spray it with oil and be prepared to stir often; it's better to use a nonstick one.  Heat with the oil over medium-high heat.  Add onions, stirring to saute for about 6 minutes, or until they start to brown but are still a little crisp.  Sprinkle the onions with flour, and, lowering heat to medium, continue to cook for about 4 minutes. 
Add about 1/2 cup vegetable stock, stirring it in to smooth it into the flour.  When the flour is incorporated and the liquid is free of any flour lumps or clumps, add a little more stock, then, finally, the entire remaining amount, stirring often.  Add nutritional yeast (you will think it's going to lump, but the flakes will dissolve), soy sauce, red wine, Umeboshi vinegar, honey, black pepper, tomato, garlic, and salt.  Bring mixture to a boil, then turn down to simmer. 
Drop in the dried shiitake mushrooms (they will hydrate as the stew cooks), with the seitan, potatoes, carrots, parsnip, and green beans.  Lower heat slightly, cover, and let ragout barely simmer, stirring every so often, for 35 minutes, or until potatoes are nearly done.  Lift lid, drop in zucchini, recover, and let cook another 10 to 15 minutes more, or until vegetables are tender but still distinct.  Serve, hot, if desired with a sprinkle of parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

     Eight Spiced Crispy Skinned Snapper In A Thai Hot And Sour Broth

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     snapper fillets with scaled skin on
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/8           cup  coarse-ground Szechwan peppercorn
     1/8           cup  ground star anise
     1/4           cup  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground fennel
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground cumin
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground coriander
     1/8           cup  coarsely-ground white peppercorn
     1/8           cup  ground ginger
                        === THAI HOT AND SOUR BROTH ===
     1/4           cup  julienned peeled ginger
  1         tablespoon  julienned peeled Galangal
  1                     white onion -- sliced
  3                     Thai bird chiles
  2             stalks  lemongrass, white part only
                        Canola oil -- as needed
     1/4           cup  Three Crab fish sauce
  4               cups  chicken stock
     3/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  Thai basil leaves
  1            package  Enoki mushrooms
     1/4           cup  sliced scallions

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pam, or other nonstick lecithin-based
                        cooking spray
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ginger (dry, not fresh)
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon, preferably Saigon
                        or Canela cinnamon
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  buttermilk -- measured into
                        a 2 cup measuring cup
  1                     egg -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  dark unsulphured molasses -- (blackstrap)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray an 8- by 11 1/2- by 2-inch baking dish with cooking spray.  Spray, as well, the bowl of a measuring tablespoon.  Set both aside. 
Combine flour, sugar, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl.  Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in shortening.  Scoop out about 1/3 cup of this mixture, and set aside for topping. 
Add the soda and salt to the buttermilk, stirring.  It will foam.  Set aside. 
Pour egg into larger amount of topping.  Add the molasses, measuring it in the sprayed tablespoon and pouring it in directly.  Stir the batter a few times, then add the buttermilk mixture.  Stir to blend ingredients, but don't worry about a few lumps.  Turn batter into prepared baking dish and sprinkle with topping.  Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until toothpick tests clean. 
Serve, if possible when still warm, plain or with whipped cream, ice cream, frozen yogurt, or baked apple. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  green, canned or freshly prepared, Poblano
                        Oil spray
  4               cups  large, coarse bread crumbs, from fresh
                        bread, left out to dry overnight (crumbs
                        of leftover
                        skillet-sizzled cornbread preferred, but
                        good
                        crusty whole-wheat bread crumbs may also
                        be used)
  1                cup  grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese - (4 oz)
  8              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
  2               cups  milk
  1               dash  hot sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  Neufchatel or cream cheese -- divided into 8 pieces
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        "Arkansalsa" -- for serving, (see recipe)

If using fresh Poblano chile, char on all sides directly over the flame, turning with tongs until chile has blackened.  Transfer charred chiles (2 to 3 Poblanos will yield 1/2 cup finished product) to a heat-proof bowl, cover tightly with film, and let cool gradually, enclosed with their own steam.  After about 1/2 hour, peel chiles, discard stem, fiber, and seeds, and dice.  Set aside. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil spray 8 to 10 (1-cup) ramekins, or 1 (14- by 11-inch) shallow baking dish.  Scatter dish or dishes with crumbs, and sprinkle crumbs with cheddar. 
In a medium bowl, combine eggs, milk, hot sauce, salt and pepper.  Whisk to blend.  Whisk in diced chiles.  Ladle and pour this mixture over the cheesed bread crumbs in ramekins or pan.  Push 1 piece of the Neufchatel into each ramekin, or at intervals throughout the single pan. 
Bake until the eggs are set and slightly puffed, about 30 minutes for large pan, 20 for ramekins.  Do not overbake.  Serve with "Arkansalsa" on the side. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced shallots
  2               cups  shredded Napa cabbage - (abt 1/2 head)
  3        tablespoons  honey
  3        tablespoons  sherry vinegar or cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  dried currants or 1/4 cup raisins
  8             ounces  fresh foie gras
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted 1 minute in
                        a saute pan
                        Country bread

In a saute pan, heat canola oil over medium heat.  Add the shallots and saute until translucent.  Add the cabbage and saute quickly until it just begins to wilt.  Remove the cabbage and shallots, and add the honey to the pan, allowing it to melt and begin to bubble.  Add the vinegar carefully so the hot honey does not splash.  Add the currants and cook just long enough to plump them.  Remove from the heat and set aside. 
With a small paring knife, carefully clean the foie gras of veins and bile, then cut into 4 1/2-inch thick slices.  Season with salt and pepper.  Heat a saute pan until it's very hot.  Add the foie gras and sear quickly on both sides. 
Place the cabbage on a heated platter.  Lay the foie gras on top of the cabbage and pour the currant sauce over the top.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Serve with bread. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  1                     onion -- diced small
  1         tablespoon  peeled, minced fresh ginger
     1/2    tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds -- ground
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed -- ground
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
  1                     tomato -- diced small
  1                cup  crabmeat -- carefully picked
  2             medium  shrimp -- minced to fine paste
  2                     limes -- zested (chopped),
                        and juiced
  8             sprigs  cilantro -- washed
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  panko - (available in Japanese specialty
                        stores)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        Avocado Salad -- (see recipe)
  4               cups  baby greens
  4                     pappadums - (available in Indian specialty
                        stores)
     1/4           cup  tamarind chutney

In a large saute pan, heat one tablespoon of the corn oil.  Add the onion, ginger and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat.  Add the coriander, cumin, turmeric and the tomato and continue to cook until it turns dry.  Remove from the heat and cool down. 
In a large mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, the cooled onion mixture, shrimp, chopped lime zest and juice, cilantro, chives, beaten egg and 3 tablespoons of the panko.  Season with salt, pepper and cayenne.  Mix well so that all the ingredients are well incorporated.  Test a small quantity by forming a teaspoon of this mix into a small patty and frying it in a pan.  Adjust the salt and pepper if necessary. 
Divide this mixture into 4 equal portions.  Form into balls and flatten to form small patties.  Put the rest of the panko on a cutting board.  Place the patties one at a time in the bread crumbs. 
Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet large enough to hold the crab cakes on medium heat.  Add the oil and fry the crab cakes.  When the cakes turn a light golden color, flip them over and cook them on the other side until they are light golden in color.  Using a slotted spatula, remove and drain on a paper towel. 
Take 4 large plates and place the baby greens in the centers and a pappadum on top of the greens.  Fill each pappadum with a scoop of Avocado Salad and top with a crab cake.  Spoon the tamarind around the plate. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Oil Spray
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  medium-finely chopped garlic
  1 1/2         pounds  very fresh okra pods, 2" to 3" long -- washed well,
                        but not cut open or destemmed
  1              large  juicy, deep-ripe summer tomato -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A few dashes of cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  dry dill weed - (to 1 tspn)

Oil spray a heavy, 10- to 14-inch cast-iron skillet, one that has a tight fitting cover.  Place on very low heat.  Add olive oil, garlic, and okra.  In contrast to most sautes, the okra gets added when neither pan, nor oil, nor garlic, is yet hot.  Scatter tomato over the okra. 
Still keeping heat very low, let okra just cook, uncovered, for about 10 minutes.  Do not stir.  Then cover, and let cook for 20 to 30 minutes more.  Keep on not stirring.  Make sure heat is low enough so nothing is burning.  If you like, you can kind of push a few of the pods back to make sure the garlic on the bottom is not burning, merely cooking, very very slowly. 
After 30 minutes, lift lid.  Stir cautiously, just a few times the okra should be quite tender, soft and sort of golden brownish.  In stirring, you want to break it up as little as possible, rather just recombine the ingredients, though it is likely that a few pods will split if they have not already done so. 
Turn off heat.  Salt and pepper the okra, sprinkle with cayenne and dill, stir one more time and serve.  Serve the whole pods.  Those dining can either cut off the stems at the top of the pods themselves (with a fork and knife), or pick them up by the stems and nibble their way down, or even eat the stems, firmer, of course, than the tender pod, but edible and tasty. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Egg Dishes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Jasmin tea
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
  2                     Tahitian vanilla beans
     1/2           cup  honey
  10                    eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  sugar -- for yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar -- for whites

Bring to a simmer the cream, milk and vanilla.  Add the tea and simmer for 10 minutes.  Take off stove and let steep for 20 minutes.  Strain and reheat liquid with the honey.  Whisk together yolks, sugar and cornstarch.  Temper mixture with simmering liquid and put back on stove.  Reduce heat.  Whisk constantly until a pastry cream consistency is achieved, about 35 minutes.  Spread base in small hotel pan, butter the top and refrigerate.  May be made 24 hours in advance. 
Lift egg whites on slow speed with a little of the sugar until a wet soft peak is reached.  Add the rest of the sugar and whisk at high speed for only 5 seconds.  Transfer to stainless steel bowl and gently fold in base at a ratio of 50/50.  Bake in buttered and sugared ramekins on preheated sheet tray at 375 for 12 minutes.  Check souffles after 6 minutes to make sure one edge is not catching.  If so, quickly open door and carefully slice the sticking side with a sharp pairing knife.  The souffle should straighten itself out.  Pull out of oven and powder sugar the souffles. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                cup  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  toasted and ground almonds
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4           cup  melted sweet butter

  6                     egg yolks
  2               cups  sweetened condensed milk
  1 3/4           cups  key lime juice
     1/4           cup  candied kumquat -- seeds and pulp

Filling:  Whip the egg yolks until thick and pale yellow (about 5 minutes).  Pour in the condensed milk and the kumquats.  Slowly add in the key lime juice.  Pour into the pie crust and bake 10 to 12 minutes. 
Cool for 1 hour and then chill completely.  Serve as desired.

Cauliflower:  Slice the cauliflower into 3/4-inch slices from the top to bottom.  Chop any excess cauliflower into 1/4-inch pieces.  Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over a medium-low flame until hot.  Brush the cauliflower slices on one side with grapeseed oil and place in the hot skillet oiled-side down.  Saute until well browned (approximately 8 minutes).  Brush the exposed side of the cauliflower slices and turn over.  Saute until well browned.  Season with salt and pepper, remove from skillet and keep warm. 
Add the chopped cauliflower to the skillet and saute with the remaining oil until well browned.  Set aside for herb salad. 
Chicken glaze:  Put chicken stock in a medium sauce pot over a medium-low flame.  Simmer to reduce until thick enough to lightly coat a spoon.  (Yields 1/4 to 1/2 cup) 
Herb Salad:  Combine the salmon (chicken) glaze and lemon juice in a hand-held blender cup.  Slowly add the lemon oil, while blending.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix the herbs, reserved cauliflower and lemon zest with 2 tablespoons of dressing.  Set aside. 
To plate:  Place equal portions of sliced cauliflower in the center of 4 warm plates.  Place a grilled salmon fillet over each cauliflower slice and top with herb salad.  Sauce the plate with the remaining salmon dressing. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Trout

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  trout -- cut into fillets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/8           cup  whole mustard seeds -- toasted, and
                        roughly ground
     1/8           cup  yellow corn meal
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1              ounce  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2        medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  6             ounces  ruby swiss chard
     1/2           cup  chick peas -- soaked, cooked,
                        or use canned
  1         tablespoon  whole butter

Add the rosemary to the maple syrup and cook over medium-high heat to reduce it to little less than 1/4 cup and thick in consistency.  Strain.  Allow the syrup to cool.  Once cool, fold in the yogurt. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Oil spray
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour
     1/3           cup  stone-ground yellow cornmeal
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  blueberries -- washed, and
                        picked over
  2        tablespoons  walnuts - (to 4 tbspns) -- toasted, chopped, (optional)
     1/4           cup  rolled oats ("regular", not instant,
                        oatmeal)
  3        tablespoons  mild oil, such as corn, canola, or peanut
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  buttermilk -- plus

Let baked breads cool 10 minutes in pan, run knife around the edge of pan, and turn loaves out.  Let finish cooling on a rack. 
This recipe yields 1 large, 2 medium, or 3 mini-loaves.

                        deboned and diced
                        === SAUCE ===
  3             pieces  sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil,
                        --julienned
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Dough:  Mix together all ingredients in a bowl until a ball is formed.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate. 
Filling:  In a food processor combine sea scallops, egg white, salt and pepper, sesame oil and one ice cube.  Process until a mousse consistency is achieved.  Fold in the leeks, ginger, coriander and diced lobster. 
Roll out the dough with a pasta machine, about 3/16-inch thick and cut out 6-inch circular shapes.  Place a small amount of mousse on end of dough.  Brush edge of dough with water or egg wash and fold over to enclose mousse.  Pinch sides to make a tight seal. 
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and drop in ravioli.  Cook for 18 minutes.  Remove from water, drain and place in individual serving dishes.  Drizzle with warm sauce. 
Sauce:  Mix all ingredients, except oil, in a small bowl.  In a heavy cast-iron pan with a lid, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil until smoking.  Turn off heat.  Place ingredients in oil and cover quickly as mixture will splatter.  Let stand for 30 seconds and spoon over ravioli. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Oven-Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms With Garlic And Coarse Salt

Recipe By     :Crescent Dragonwagon
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Mushrooms


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Oil spray
  1              pound  shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed
                        (abt 1 1/4 lbs with stems; save stems for
                        stock)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 3 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  very finely-minced or pureed fresh garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse sea salt (if salt is in very large
                        crystals, you may crush it a bit in a
                        mortar and pestle)
                        Herb sprigs -- for garnish, (optional)
                        (thyme or a bit of rosemary)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray the pan with oil.  Place shiitakes in baking dish; caps up or down, it makes no difference.  Make sure pan is big enough so the mushrooms are not on top of each other; they need air space and breathing room to roast up properly. 
Toss the mushrooms with the oil, garlic, and salt.  Pop the pan in the oven, uncovered, and let bake 10 to 12 minutes.  Take them out.  Shake the pan a few times.  Some of the mushrooms should be starting to get a little golden on the lighter, underneath side of the caps.  You will probably need to put them back in for a few more minutes say, 3 to 5 minutes, maybe more if your oven wasn't really hot when you put them in.  At least a third of the mushrooms should be starting to color and get a little crunchy.  Using the lesser amount of oil, this will happen more quickly. 
Serve, warm or at room temperature, with an optional decorative sprig of herb. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings as a starter; however, most people will want two portions.

      Pan Roasted Red Snapper With Basil Oil And Sun-dried Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Michael Lomonaco
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pieces  red snapper fillet - (5 oz ea) -- skin on, but
                        with all pin bones removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive or vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  sun-dried tomatoes, soaked in hot water,
                        drained and julienned
  1                     garlic clove -- finely minced
  3        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  4          teaspoons  Basil Oil -- (see recipe)

Season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper.  Preheat a saute pan with the olive oil until the oil is hot, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the snapper to the hot pan, flesh-side down, and cook over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn to cook the skin side an additional 3 to 4 minutes.  The fillets will curl inward briefly, but once they have cooked 1 minute, they will begin to relax and lay flat again, allowing you to cook the skin side to a crispy texture. 
Lift out the snapper with a slotted spatula, leaving the juices and oil in the pan.  Add the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and shallots, and saute together 2 minutes.  Add the fresh herbs to the pan.  Stir quickly just to heat the herbs enough to release their aromas.  Pour the sun-dried tomato and herb mixture over the snapper.  Then drizzle 1 teaspoon Basil Oil over each fillet and around the dish.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

In smoking pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Season scallops with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, then add to hot oil.  Sear deeply until warm brown color; turn each scallop over and finish in a 375 degree oven (for 3 minutes). 
In desired plate or bowl place pasta with sauce, when scallops are done arrange them on top of pasta.  Liberally swizzle pesto over plate and garnish with purple basil sprig. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Poached Pears In Phyllo Dough With Madeira Zabaglione

Recipe By     :Michael Lomonaco
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  firm pears
  3               cups  water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2                     whole cloves
  1              small  dried chili pepper, such as Habanero
  1            package  phyllo dough - (16 oz)
     1/2           cup  melted unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  3        extra-large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sweet Portuguese Madeira
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries or cherries -- soaked in
                        hot water for 20 minutes

Choose firm pears that still have their stems attached.  Peel the skin off with a vegetable peeler, being careful not to clip the stem, and cut a thin slice off the bottom to create a flat surface so that the pears will stand upright during poaching. 
For the poaching liquid, combine the water, wine, sugar and spices in a pot large enough to immerse the pears two-thirds of the way in the liquid.  Bring the liquid to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the pears, standing each in an upright position. 
Return to a boil, then adjust the heat so the liquid is simmering.  Simmer the pears gently for 10 to 12 minutes, or until just tender when pierced by the tip of a knife.  Remove the pears from the liquid so that they do not continue to cook.  When they have cooled completely, core the pears from the bottom.  Dry any excess liquid off the pears. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  To prepare the pastry, allow 3 sheets phyllo per pear.  Brush each of the 3 sheets with the melted butter, layering them one atop the next.  Place 1 pear in the center of the pastry square, pull the four corners up towards the top, and pinch the corners around the stem, leaving as much of the stem exposed as possible.  If there is too much phyllo at the top, trim some off before pinching the pastry closed.  Brush additional butter over the outside of the phyllo.  Bake the pears for 20 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown.  Cool for several minutes. 
While the pears are baking, make the Zabaglione by combining the sugar, egg yolks, and Madeira in the top of a non-aluminum double boiler or bain-marie.  Place over hot water, and whisk the ingredients to a light, frothy, golden yellow, and cook until the bottom scrapes clean with each stroke.  The yolks should be firm but not scrambled. 
Divide the warm Zabaglione among 4 dessert plates.  Place a pear on each, and garnish with the cherries or cranberries. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === CHILI MINT CHUTNEY ===
  1                cup  Mexican mint leaves
  5                     scallions -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- or more to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  white vinegar

  2              small  hot chili peppers
  2        tablespoons  water -- or more, if necessary
                        === CARROT CARDAMOM CHUTNEY ===
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh coconut

  2             medium  beets -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- for roasting beets
  2            bunches  arugula with medium-size leaves -- washed, dried
     1/2           cup  crumbled Roquefort cheese
     1/2           cup  toasted spiced pecans
                        === BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE ===
  2        tablespoons  Dion mustard
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                     egg yolk
  1                     garlic clove -- mashed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt and pepper, mixed
                        === PECANS ===
  1         tablespoon  butter or vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  pecans, halves and pieces
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2            pinches  garam masala spice mix
                        === CHIVE OIL ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the following 4 steps ahead of time.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees, rub beets with vegetable oil and place on a baking dish.  Cover with aluminum foil and roast for approximately 45 minutes until tender when pierced with a knife.  Set aside to cool, then slice into 1/4- to 1/8-inch thick slices with knife or mandoline.  Reserve juices on bottom of pan for decoration. 
Place mustard in blender with balsamic vinegar and egg yolk and garlic.  Puree together, then slowly drizzle the 2 oils into the blender to make an emulsified dressing.  Blend about 1 minute, then add salt and pepper to taste.  If dressing is too thick you can add a little water to thin it out.  Set aside. 
Place a saute pan on medium heat, add the butter or oil, when heated add the pecans, sugar, salt and pepper and spices.  Toss together and heat until lightly toasted.  Set aside. 
Wash arugula well, it can be sandy depending on what you buy.  Spin dry and set aside. 
In mixing bowl toss arugula with dressing, cheese and pecans, toss well.  Arrange sliced beets in a ring on plates, then place arugula in center, taking care to give height to the plate.  Sprinkle the cheese and pecans at bottom of bowl onto each salad. 
In a blender, combine chive oil ingredients and blend well.  Transfer to a squeeze bottle.  Squeeze a ring of chive oil onto each plate and drizzle a spoonful of beet juices from roasting to give contrasting colors. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  whipped heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  toasted ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro

     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- may need
                        a little more
                        === STAR ANISE CARROT SYRUP ===
  16            ounces  carrot juice
  2              whole  star anise
     1/2           cup  canola oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GINGERED BEET MASH ===
  2               cups  peeled, chopped red beets
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter

Roast whole eggplants in a 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes or until eggplants are cooked through and scoop out eggplant while it is still hot. 
Caramelize shallots and garlic.  Add sambal, honey, butter and eggplant.  With a hand mixer, puree until very smooth.  Transfer to bowl and let cool. 
Fold into cooled mixture the eggs, 3/4 of the whipped cream, cumin, cilantro and scallions.  Sift in flour until a pancake consistency is achieved. 
In a small non-stick pan and clarified butter, ladle in 3 ounces of batter and color one side, flip, and cook in a 400 degree oven until the other side is browned and the pancake puffs up a bit. 
Star Anise Carrot Syrup:  In a sauce pan, reduce juice with star anise down to the 'scum'.  Take out star anise and transfer 'scum' to a blender.  Blend at high speed while slowly adding oil to emulsify.  Check for seasoning. 
Gingered Beet Mash:  Boil beets in water until extremely soft.  Saute onions and ginger.  Transfer all to food processor and blend with honey.  Slowly add chunks of butter until a mash consistency is achieved.  Check for seasoning. 
Place small bit of beet mash in the center of a plate.  Top with one pancake and repeat process until you have a 'short stack'.  Dab with a little whipped cream and sliced scallions.  Pour 'syrup' on pancakes.  Slice out one small wedge and set askew. 
This recipe yields 4 portions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  ricotta
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1                     egg yolk -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh basil
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated lemon zest
  2              small  garlic cloves
  6                     Cornish game hens
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2                 lemons -- cut 6 quarters
  1 1/2          small  onions -- cut 6 quarters
     1/2           cup  white wine

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
Place the ricotta in a fine sieve and drain for 30 minutes.  In a medium bowl, combine the drained ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolk, herbs and lemon zest.  Put the garlic clove through a garlic press and into the ricotta.  Mix well, adding salt and pepper to taste. 
Rinse the game hens and pat them dry.  Season the cavities with salt and pepper and place a quarter lemon and a quarter onion in each cavity.  Loosen the skin on the breasts by sliding your fingers under the skin, being careful not to pierce it.  Spoon the ricotta mixture under the skin (about 4 tablespoons of stuffing per bird.)  Truss the birds. 
Place the birds, breast-side up, in a shallow roasting pan.  Pour the white wine into the pan.  Bake for 1 hour, or until the juices run clear when the hen is pierced in the thickest part of the thigh.  Remove from the oven and serve with the pan juices spooned over the hens.

               Roasty Toasty Potatoes, Carrots, And Onions

Recipe By     :Crescent Dragonwagon
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  mature red potatoes - (about 8 small
                        but not tiny potatoes) -- scrubbed, but
                        not peeled, eyes removed
  1              pound  carrots - (about 6 medium) -- washed, and
                        scrubbed, unpeeled, stem end left on
  2              large  onions -- quartered, peel on
  1         tablespoon  mild vegetable oil, such as
                        corn, peanut, or canola oil
  1         tablespoon  Tamari or Shoyu soy sauce - (to 2 tbspns) -- plus additional
                        to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bring 2 large pots of water to a boil.  Oil spray a baking dish, or dishes; you need baking space large enough to accommodate all the vegetables so they're not lying on top of each other. 
Drop the potatoes into one pot of boiling water and blanch for about 6 to 8 minutes, then drain well, running cold water over potatoes.  Repeat with the carrots in the second pot of water, allowing 4 minutes blanching time for long, skinny carrots; 5 to 6 for fatter carrots.  Drain well. 
Place the potatoes and carrots in the prepared baking dish with the onion quarters (raw, skin still on).  Toss the vegetables with oil, rubbing it into the vegetables a bit with your hands.  Let bake about half an hour, then drizzle with the Tamari or Shoyu and toss again (yes, of course using an implement this time, silly or just shake the pan with pot-holdered hands). 
Let bake until potatoes and carrots are soft, you should be able to pierce them easily with a fork at their thickest point, and quite browned here and there, especially on the edge that has touched the pan.  This will take about 45 to 55 minutes total. 
Serve, at once, hot... but these agreeable vegetables also don't mind staying in a warm place for 30 minutes or so if need be even an hour before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

      Salmon Tempura Roll With Mirin Leeks, Wasabi Oil And Soy Syrup

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salmon
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     leeks, white only -- julienned
  1         tablespoon  clarified butter or neutral oil
     1/3           cup  mirin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  whole butter
  4                     salmon paillards - (3 oz ea)
  4             sheets  nori
  2               cups  rice flour
                        Soda water
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Toasted sesame seeds -- for garnish
                        Gari, pickled ginger -- for garnish
                        === WASABI OIL ===
     1/2           cup  wasabi powder
  1         tablespoon  mirin
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Water
     1/2           cup  neutral oil
                        === SOY SYRUP ===
  2               cups  thin soy sauce
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1                     lime -- juiced

Heat pan and saute leeks.  Do not caramelize, keep them white.  Deglaze with mirin and reduce all liquid.  Toss in butter and check for seasoning. 
Lay salmon paillard to cover 2/3 of nori sheet.  Lay cooled leeks on salmon and roll.  Save 1/4 of the leeks for plate up.  In a stainless steel bowl, whisk soda water into rice flour until a paint consistency is achieved. 
Heat oil to 375 degrees.  Dip roll into tempura and fry until golden brown.  The salmon should end up medium-rare at most! 
Wasabi Oil:  In a stainless steel bowl, whisk wasabi, mirin and sugar.  Add water until a loose puree is achieved.  Whisk in oil. 
Soy Syrup:  Combine all and reduce at a simmer until a syrup is achieved, 70 to 80 percent reduction. 
Slice tempura on the bias and some straight cuts.  Zigzag wasabi oil and soy syrup on the plate.  Place small mound of leeks and surround with slices.  Garnish with sesame seeds and ginger. 
This recipe yields 4 portions. 
ADDITIONAL PLATE UPS: 
     Salmon carpaccio with truffle oil and shiitake chips
     Salmon and caviar parfait

                        Sesame Raisin Vinaigrette

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar or blueberry vinegar
     1/4           cup  dark raisins, preferably Manunkah
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  peanut oil
     1/4           cup  toasted sesame oil (sometimes called
                        'dark'
                        or 'oriental' style sesame oil)

In a nonreactive bowl, place vinegar and raisins and let stand overnight, to soften raisins slightly. 
In the morning, toast sesame seeds: in a small, heavy skillet, toast the sesame seeds over medium heat, stirring the seeds often and shaking the pan, until they begin to pop, turn golden brown, and give off a pleasant fragrance.  This should take 2 to 4 minutes. 
Transfer toasted seeds, and soaked raisins and vinegar, to the workbowl of a food processor.  Add honey and salt.  Buzz until raisins and seeds are chopped to a smooth, chunky paste, pulsing if needed and perhaps scraping down bowl sides a time or two. 
Put machine's feedertube in place (assuming the tube has a small hole in the bottom).  With machine running, pour both oils gradually into the tube, allowing oil to drizzle down into the machine.  The oil will emulsify in the raisin mixture.  Continue until all oil has been incorporated and dressing is smooth.

In a nonreactive bowl, place vinegar and raisins and let stand overnight, to soften raisins slightly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the morning, toast sesame seeds: in a small, heavy skillet, toast the sesame seeds over medium heat, stirring the seeds often and shaking the pan, until they begin to pop, turn golden brown, and give off a pleasant fragrance.  This should take 2 to 4 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer toasted seeds, and soaked raisins and vinegar, to the workbowl of a food processor.  Add honey and salt.  Buzz until raisins and seeds are chopped to a smooth, chunky paste, pulsing if needed and perhaps scraping down bowl sides a time or two. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put machine&apos;s feedertube in place (assuming the tube has a small hole in the bottom).  With machine running, pour both oils gradually into the tube, allowing oil to drizzle down into the machine.  The oil will emulsify in the raisin mixture.  Continue until all oil has been incorporated and dressing is smooth.

This recipe yields about 1 3/4 cups.

                    Shellfish Ravioli In Saffron Broth

Recipe By     :Michael Lomonaco
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  cooked shrimp, crab, and/or lobster meat
  4              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  soft white bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  1            package  wonton wrappers
  4               cups  fish broth
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads
  1              small  to medium tomato -- diced
                        Chopped fresh herbs, such as tarragon
                        or chives

In a food processor place shellfish meat and 3 eggs.  With a metal blade pulse until the seafood is coarsely chopped.  Scrape the sides.  Add the cream, bread crumbs, salt and pepper and pulse to combine.  Don't overprocess the cream or it will become grainy -- or even turn to butter.  Remove the mixture to a bowl and add the chopped tarragon leaves, blending them in with a spatula. 
Lay out 1 wonton skin on a board.  Using a pastry bag or a teaspoon, place approximately 1 teaspoon filling on its center.  In a small bowl combine remaining egg with 3 tablespoons of water.  Brush a second wonton skin with the egg-wash mixture and lay it over the filling, pressing lightly with your fingers to remove any trapped air and to seal the edges of the wonton skins. 
The uncooked ravioli can be stored in a covered container up to 2 days in the refrigerator, or for several weeks in the freezer.  To freeze, lay the ravioli in a single layer on a waxed-paper-lined sheet pan and place in the freezer until frozen.  They can then be removed and stored in a pastry bag. 
In a saucepan, bring the fish broth to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and add the saffron.  Continue to simmer for 5 minutes while you begin to cook the ravioli. 
To cook, place the ravioli in boiling salted water and continue boiling until they begin to float (about 2 to 3 minutes for fresh ravioli, 5 to 6 minutes for frozen ones).  Drain and divide among 4 bowls.  Add 1/2 cup fish broth to each bowl, then garnish with a little diced tomato and some chopped fresh herbs, such as tarragon or chives.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            medium  shrimp
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2             medium  oranges -- sectioned to 24 pieces
  24                    black olives -- pitted

Peel and devein the shrimp.  In a large bowl, stir together the oil, vinegar, orange juice, basil, red pepper and salt.  Add the shrimp and toss to coat with the mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes, tossing once or twice. 
Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat the broiler.  Remove the shrimp from the marinade.  Reserve the marinade.  Thread the skewers in this order: orange section, olive, shrimp, olive, orange section.  As you thread the shrimp, bend it so that the larger end nearly touches the smaller end so the skewer passes through the body twice. 
Arrange the skewers on the grill or broiler rack.  Grill or broil, turning them often and brushing them with the reserved marinade, until the shrimp turn pink, about 6 minutes. 
This recipe yields 12 skewers.

            Skate With Garlic Buerre Blanc And Balsamic Glaze

Recipe By     :Matthew Tivy
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUERRE BLANC ===
  3        tablespoons  white wine
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  8             ounces  butter -- cut small cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  roasted garlic puree -- (make extra
                        for other uses)
  2              whole  garlic cloves
                        === BALSAMIC REDUCTION ===
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        === SKATE ===
  4                     skate wing fillets - (8 oz ea)
                        Wondra flour -- for dredging
                        Oil -- for frying

Do these first 3 steps together.  Combine wine, vinegar, shallots and raw garlic in medium saucepan, bring to boil and cook over high heat until reduced to almost dry (don't burn).  At this point add heavy cream and set aside. 
Combine ketchup, balsamic vinegar and soy sauce in saucepan and bring to boil.  Cook over high heat until reduced to a syrupy glaze (it will be thicker when cooled), set aside. 
To finish buerre blanc return saucepan to medium heat.  When cream is hot, whisk in butter, 1 to 2 pieces at a time, allowing each piece to be incorporated before adding more, don't allow to boil.  When all is incorporated, add salt and pepper and roasted garlic puree.  Can keep warm about 1 to 2 hours, not too hot though (keep in thermos). 
Heat nonstick pan over medium-high heat, season skate fillets with salt and pepper, then dredge lightly in Wondra flour.  Put oil into saute pan, add skate, (whiter-side down first).  Don't turn over until browned nicely (peek, but use restraint and wait).  Then flip over to other side and cook another 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from pan with a spatula if possible and set on a buttered or non stick baking sheet. 
When all fish is sauteed and ready to serve, heat in oven until hot.  Place a spoonful of butter sauce onto each plate, then the fillet of skate onto the sauce.  Drizzle each fillet with ribbons of balsamic glaze and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Striped Bass With Salsify Flan, Asparagus And Oven Roasted Creamer Potatoes

Recipe By     :Jim Coleman
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  2                     skin-on wild striped-bass fillets - (8 oz
                        ea)
  3        tablespoons  white wine
  1         tablespoon  capers
  1           teaspoon  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2                     eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  pureed cooked salsify
  1              bunch  asparagus -- trimmed, blanched
  10            ounces  creamer potatoes - (abt 8 potatoes)
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  whole butter

In a non-stick pan heat the oil until hot and pan sear the striped bass skin side-down for approximately 1 to 2 minutes or until crisp.  Turn and finish cooking on the other side.  Remove the fish and pour off the excess oil and deglaze the pan with the white wine and add the remaining ingredients.  Spoon the mixture over the fish once the butter has melted.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Oil spray
  2          teaspoons  butter
  1              small  onion -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- pressed
     2/3           cup  soft, fine whole-wheat bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  sweet basil
     1/8      teaspoon  rosemary
  1                box  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, and
                        thoroughly drained (save liquid for soup
                        stock)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  4                     tomatoes - (to 6) -- prepared for stuffing

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In a nonstick, or oil-sprayed skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onion and saute 6 minutes, or until softened, translucent, limp and just starting to brown around the edges.  Add garlic, lower heat slightly, and saute 2 minutes longer, stirring. 
Add bread crumbs, herbs, and spinach.  Stir well and remove from heat.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add egg and Parmesan. 
When the mixture is cool enough to handle, stuff it into the prepared tomato shells.  Stuff rather firmly, and round filling over the tops of tomatoes.  Place tomatoes on a Pam sprayed baking sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes, or until the tops are slightly browned and crunchy.  Serve hot or at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 stuffed tomatoes.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- cut up
  2                     eggs
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
     3/4           cup  white sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  decaf coffee crystals
  1 1/2    tablespoons  boiling water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  unbleached white flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa (not "Dutch")
  8             ounces  best-quality semisweet chocolate chips,
                        such as Ghiradelli
  6             ounces  chopped pecans or walnuts - (to 8 oz) -- (optional),
                        preferably toasted
                        Nonstick lecithin-based cooking spray

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine butter, vegetable shortening and semisweet chocolate in a small saucepan.  Heat over low-medium until all ingredients are uniformly melted, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat, stir again to smooth, and let cool to room temperature. 
Meanwhile, whip together at medium-high speed for 5 minutes the eggs, brown sugar, and white sugar.  As eggs and sugar beat, make coffee concentrate by placing decaf in a small bowl and pouring boiling water over it, stirring to dissolve crystals.  Stir in vanilla.  After eggs and sugar have been beaten, add the decaf vanilla mixture, and the reserved melted chocolate mixture.  Beat another 2 minutes.  Combine the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, salt, and unsweetened cocoa.  These ingredients need not be sifted, but they should be stirred or whisked together well. 
Remove chocolate mixture from mixer stand and stir flour cocoa mixture into it by hand.  Lastly, stir in chips and optional nuts. 
Spray two double insulated style cookie sheets with cooking spray. 
To make ordinary sized cookies (about 3 inches in diameter), drop batter by rounded teaspoons, about 2 inches apart, onto prepared cookie sheets.  To make the very large cookies about 6 to 8 inches in diameter, such as we serve at Dairy Hollow House, scoop batter with a 2 1/2-inch ice cream scoop, 3/8 of a cup capacity.  You can get 2 to 3 of the large cookies on a sheet.  (There is no need to "splat" the cookies out with your hand; they will spread while baking.) 
Bake small cookies in preheated oven for about 10 minutes; large will take about 20.  Let the cookies cool on sheets 1 minute before transferring to rack. 
This recipe yields about 33 three-inch cookies or 15 six-inch cookies.

  1                cup  sliced shiitakes
  1                cup  cleaned oyster mushrooms
  1                cup  cleaned chanterelles
  1         tablespoon  white truffle oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh minced thyme
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        Canola oil -- for sauteing
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === KAFFIR LIME BROTH ===
  1                     onion -- sliced
  1                     jalapeÒo -- sliced with seeds
  1         tablespoon  peeled, minced ginger
  8                     fresh kaffir lime leaves
                        (or 12 dried leaves)
     1/3           cup  Three Crab fish sauce
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper

Caramelize 4/5 of the leeks, shallots and garlic.  Deglaze with wine and completely reduce.  Individually saute each of the mushrooms with a very hot pan in a little oil.  Combine 3/4 of the mushrooms with above and mix in butter and thyme.  Check for seasoning and let cool. 
With wonton wrappers and egg wash, make dumplings.  Blanch dumplings in rolling water for only 2 minutes, until the wrappers are al dente.  With the remaining leeks, cover with rice flour and deep-fry crisp at 250 degrees until golden brown. 
Kaffir Lime Broth:  Saute onions, jalapeÒo and ginger.  Add kaffir leaves and deglaze with fish sauce.  Add chicken stock and reduce by 2 percent.  Check for seasoning.  Strain and keep hot. 
In a soup plate, place a small mound of the remaining mushrooms in the center of each plate.  Surround with 3 dumplings and ladle in broth.  Garnish with fried leeks. 
This recipe yields 4 portions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh shallots
  1                cup  sliced cremini mushrooms
  1                cup  sliced white button mushrooms
  1                cup  sliced shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed
  1                cup  sliced portobello mushrooms -- stems removed
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
     1/2           cup  peeled, diced salsify
  1         tablespoon  medium-chopped tarragon
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions
  4             sheets  phyllo dough
                        Water -- to brush on dough
  2               cups  sodium-free beef broth
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped shallots
     1/4           cup  fresh tarragon leaves
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  dry white wine

In a large saute pan sprayed with a non-stick spray, add garlic and shallots and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add all the sliced mushrooms and saute for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until there is no liquid in the bottom of the pan.

Cut phyllo sheets into 6 equal squares and place in the center of each square 1/4 cup of mushroom mixture.  With each square, pull the four corners together and seal in mushroom contents to resemble a purse. 
Place 6 purses on a non-stick cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. 
Place in small pan, beef broth, 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and 1 teaspoon of finely minced shallots and bring to a boil.  Add the 1/4 cup freshly chopped tarragon. 
Combine cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of white wine and add cornstarch mixture to boiling stock to thicken.  Continue to simmer for an additional 5 minutes.  Allowing sauce to thicken. 
To serve, ladle 4 ounces of tarragon jus on the bottom of a large serving bowl and top with phyllo purse.  Serve immediately.

                          Winter Squash Risotto

Recipe By     :Raymond G. DeForest Jr.
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Rice
                Squash

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     butternut squash - (abt 2 1/2 to 3 lbs)
  5               cups  chicken stock - (to 6 cups)
                        (or canned, fat-free)
  1              piece  bacon
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     shallots -- minced
  2               cups  Arborio rice
     1/2          cups  dry white wine
                        Freshly-ground nutmeg -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Cut squash into medium-size pieces, scrape out seeds and stringy flesh and discard.  Steam cleaned pieces of squash for 10 to 15 minutes until tender.  Remove skin and mash smooth.  Place stock in a saucepan and heat until simmering. 
In a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, fry bacon piece until crisp.  Remove bacon, leaving grease in the pan.  Crumble bacon for use as a garnish and set aside. 
Add oil and shallots and cook for about 2 minutes.  Stir in the rice and cook for 5 minutes over moderately-high heat.  Stir slowly but constantly.  This will "toast" the rice and start to turn it slightly golden and feel loose and dry.  You should start to hear the rice "click."  Add the wine all at once to the rice and cook over fairly high heat to boil it down. 
When the rice is almost dry, stir in 1 cup of stock and mashed squash.  Simmer until the sock is absorbed.  Continue adding stock 1 cup at a time and stirring until rice becomes creamy while the grains remain separate and firm, but not hard in the center of the grain.  This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the nutmeg, salt, pepper and rosemary and stir.  Stir in the butter and 1/2 cup Parmesan. 
Place in individual serving bowls and sprinkle with remaining cheese, crumbled bacon and a sprig of rosemary.  Enjoy! 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 main course servings. 
Hints for success:  The pot must be heavy on the bottom to keep the temperature even during the cooking process.  Arborio is a short grained rice.  It is very starchy, which is necessary to produce the desired result of a creamy risotto.  Look for a fat opaque center in the rice, known as "LaPerla," this indicates a good starch content.  Wine is the first liquid to be added to the rice.  The first liquid will be absorbed totally and the acid in the wine balances the starch and adds flavor. 
Toasting the rice seals in the flavor.  There should be about 3 times the amount of stock as rice.  Make sure the stock is very hot.  The stock is added slowly to the rice and releases the starch gradually, creating a creamy texture.  Constant stirring is needed to produce the best results.

                        cut into chunks
  1              large  European cucumber -- skinned, halved,
                        seeded, and cut into chunks
  2             medium  red onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  1                     fresh jalapeÒo pepper -- stemmed, seeded
  12                    garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  pure olive oil
     1/4           cup  sherry or balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  bottled tomato juice
  1        small bunch  fresh cilantro leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2         pound  tiny salad shrimp
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry (not cooking sherry)
     1/2      teaspoon  hot chili oil

Dip the tomatoes briefly in boiling water to loosen the skins, then in an ice-water bath.  Peel, cut in half, remove and discard the seeds, and dice. 
Finely dice approximately 1/2 cup of the tomato, peppers, and cucumbers, and 1/4 cup of the onions to reserve for garnish.  Place the remaining vegetables along with the remaining gazpacho ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Process until smooth.  Place in a covered container and refrigerate 45 minutes to an hour before serving. 
While the soup is chilling, make the garnish by sauteing the shrimp and garlic in olive oil for 2 minutes.  Remove the shrimp from the pan and cool. 
Ladle the soup into the chilled bowls.  Garnish each bowl with the reserved diced vegetables, the sherry, the hot chili oil, and the seared shrimp.  Serve immediately
