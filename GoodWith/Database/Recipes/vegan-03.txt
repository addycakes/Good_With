                          Artichoke Hummus Wraps

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ARTICHOKE SPREAD ===
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- drained, halved
  1                cup  canned chickpeas -- drained and rinsed
     1/3           cup  tahini
     1/3           cup  fresh parsley
  1             medium  garlic clove -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice - (to 2)
                        === WRAPS ===
  1 1/4           cups  thinly-sliced green cabbage
  2             medium  carrots -- shredded (3/4 cup)
     1/2        medium  green bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  plain low-fat yogurt
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped red onion
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  6                     flour tortillas - (10" dia)

To make artichoke spread, in food processor or blender combine all artichoke spread ingredients and 2 tablespoons water.  Process until mixture is almost smooth but retains some texture and is slightly thicker than hummus.  If necessary, add water by teaspoonfuls to thin.  Season with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate if not using immediately.

In medium bowl, combine cabbage, carrots, pepper, yogurt, parsley, onion and 2 teaspoon lemon juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, and mix well.

In large skillet, warm each tortilla over medium heat just until soft and flexible, about 1 minute per side.  Spread some artichoke mixture over each tortilla, leaving 1/2-inch border.  Top with cabbage mixture, dividing equally.  Fold up one or both ends of tortilla over filling, then roll each sandwich into bundle.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Per Serving: 358 Cal; 13g Prot; 10g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 53g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 475mg  Sod.; 9g Fiber.

Comments:  Canned chickpeas and artichoke hearts are the quick-fix secrets to this sandwich spread, which tastes great combined with a crunchy cabbage slaw.  Wraps can serve as a meal in themselves, but a fresh fruit salad is an appropriate accompaniment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  tempeh -- cubed
  6             ounces  Asian-style baked tofu -- cubed
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  tamari soy sauce
  4               cups  shredded green papaya - (firmly packed)
  2             medium  tomatoes -- diced
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves - (loosely packed) -- for garnish
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- for garnish
                        === DRESSING ===
                        Juice of 1 lime
  3        tablespoons  tamari soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Heat oil in wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir-fry tempeh in two batches for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crispy and golden.  Drain on paper towels and place in small bowl with 3 tablespoons soy sauce to marinate.  Refrigerate to cool.

Fill serving bowl with shredded green papaya and toss with diced tomatoes.

To make dressing, stir together lime juice, tamari soy sauce, sugar, garlic and oil to taste.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Toss papaya and tomatoes with dressing.

Just before serving, toss tempeh and tofu with shredded papaya.  Garnish with mint leaves and sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Per Serving: 350 Cal; 22g Prot; 16g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 28g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 1600mg  Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  Green papaya is almost flavorless and readily lends itself to an assertive dressing; for an even bolder flavor, add diced, fresh chilies to the salad.  Remember that if you can't find this fruit preshredded, allow extra preparation time for shredding your own.  An Asian-style seasoned and baked tofu adds another element of texture and flavor; if you can't find baked tofu, be sure at least to select a firm variety, even if it is unseasoned.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small beets - (16 to 24) -- greens intact
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime or lemon juice
                        = (or balsamic vinegar, to taste)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped dill, fresh coriander or tarragon

Scrub beets and steam until tender-firm and a knife enters easily, 10 to 15 minutes if very small and 25 minutes or longer if large.  Set aside to cool, and slip off skins.  Quarter, halve or leave whole.

Discard stems and keep greens, discarding any that are bruised or badly torn.  Steam over beet water until tender, about 5 minutes.  Toss with half olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.

Arrange greens on serving dish.  Toss beets with remaining oil, lime juice and fresh herbs.  Pile onto greens and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 100 Cal; 2g Prot; 4g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 15g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 12mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  At the farmers' market you'll often find vegetables that are gigantic, peculiar in shape or especially small, like our local beets available both early and late in the season.  Their verdant crown of leaves is always fresh and tender, and it's a simple matter to serve them together.  The beets can be any variety or shape, such as golden or chioggia varieties.

  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce or tamari

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Drain tofu very well and cut into triangles or slabs about 1 1/2 inches wide.  Place in ungreased pie plate and bake until slightly firm and liquid is released, about 20 minutes.  Pour off any liquid.  Set tofu aside; maintain oven temperature at 375 degrees.

In large skillet, heat oil over high heat.  Add onions and cook, stirring often, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add bell peppers, mushrooms, 1 garlic clove, parsley, marjoram and thyme and cook, stirring often, 2 to 3 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, about 6 minutes.  Stir in wine, olives, salt and pepper and cook, until vegetables are tender and coated with syrupy sauce, about 8 minutes.

Coat 8- by 8-inch square or 2-quart casserole with cooking spray.  Add vegetable mixture, then gently arrange tofu pieces in mixture.

Make sauce:  In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, tomato paste, mustard, garlic, pepper and soy sauce or tamari.  Pour sauce over vegetables and tofu.  Cover and bake until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Bean Thread Noodles With Asian Eggplant

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  bean thread noodles - (8.8 oz)
  2                     Asian eggplants - (abt 1 lb) -- stem ends removed
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  4                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  1            package  tofu nuggets - (5 oz)
     1/4           cup  vinegar
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  tamarind concentrate
  1                cup  fresh coriander -- roughly chopped

Soak bean thread noodles in water for 10 minutes.  Bring 4 cups water to a boil and place eggplants in water to poach.  Reduce heat to medium and cook, turning often, for about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat large skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons oil.  Stir-fry garlic and, when golden, remove from pan.  Add 2 sliced shallots and stir-fry until golden.  Add remaining oil and heat tofu cubes through, browning slightly.  Remove from heat.

When eggplants are tender, remove from heat, drain and set aside to cool slightly.  When cool enough to handle, slice into 2-inch-long pieces.

To create sauce, combine vinegar, sugar and tamarind concentrate in small saucepan and heat over medium heat until sugar dissolves.

Trim noodle bundle in half and add to skillet with half dressing mixture and garlic.  Let noodles heat through and absorb liquid, cooking and stirring over medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Remove noodles from skillet and place in serving dish.  Top with tofu and eggplant.

Garnish with coriander leaves and remaining sliced shallots and pass with remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 550 Cal; 10g Prot; 18g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 51g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 120mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Trebbiano is a white wine grape exported from Italy to France and locally renamed Ugni Blanc.  Although lighter in every way, Ugni Blanc shares taste characteristics and food affinities with Sauvignon Blanc.  Try Domaine de Pouy CÈpage Ugni Blanc.

Comments:  A warmed-up adaptation of a popular Thai salad, this light dish calls for a trip to your Asian market for the tofu nuggets, bean thread noodles and tamarind concentrate.  Tofu nuggets are prefried cubes of tofu.  Bean thread noodles, made from mung bean starch, absorb water readily, but be sure to soak them while still tied up with their string or the noodles will be difficult to manage.

           Bluefoot Or Mixed Wild Mushroom Risotto With Arugula

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  8             ounces  coarsely-chopped bluefoot mushrooms
                        = (or mixed cremini, shiitake and
                        oyster mushrooms, chopped)
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2                onion or two big shallots -- finely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white wine
  5               cups  water or vegetable stock
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  grated Parmegiano-Reggiano cheese
  1                cup  arugula or flat-leaf parsley -- washed, dried,
                        and minced

Heat large skillet over medium heat and, when hot to touch, add 1/8 cup olive oil and heat until fragrant but not smoking.  Add chopped mushrooms and sautÈ gently until softened, stirring occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add salt and pepper and scrape mixture into bowl.

In saucepan, bring water or stock to a boil and keep it simmering.  Wipe skillet with paper towel and heat again.  Add remaining 1/8 cup oil and heat over medium heat.  When fragrant, add chopped onion or shallots and reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until translucent but not brown.  Add rice and stir to coat with oil.

Add wine and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously and increasing heat to medium, if needed.  In 1/2-cup increments, add boiling water or stock, stirring after each addition, not adding more liquid until all is absorbed.  Stir often and avoid adding too much liquid.

After 15 to 20 minutes, liquid should be absorbed and rice creamy with a slightly chewy center.

Remove from heat and stir in mushrooms, cream, cheese and chopped arugula or parsley.  Stir until melted and combined, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 570 Cal; 12g Prot; 22g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 72g Carb.; 25mg  Chol; 300mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The main components of this dishómushrooms, leafy greens, black pepper and Parmesan cheese -- will match well with Cabernet Sauvignon.  Try Bonterra Vineyard's Organically Grown North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon.  The tannins are a good match with the olive oil, cheese and earthiness of the mushrooms, letting you savor the fruit in the wine.

Comments:  Bluefoots are cultivated versions of wild blewit mushrooms, and they have a wonderful texture and aroma.  While bluefoots tend to be available only from specialty stores, mixed exotic mushrooms are often sold in packages in the produce section of gourmet groceries.  This mix of cremini, shiitake and oyster mushrooms is a common one.  Whether you use bluefoots or a blend of mushrooms, this risotto is a palate-pleasing dinner entrÈe.  To use leftovers, form them into patties, and brown them in olive oil to create tasty rice croquettes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  2               cups  thinly-sliced onions
  6              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  light mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  oil-cured black olives -- chopped

In large skillet, heat oil over medium-low heat.  Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 12 minutes.  Drain and rinse eggs under cold running water.  Refrigerate eggs, 30 minutes.  Peel eggs; set aside 2 yolks for another use.

In a medium bowl, mash remaining eggs with a fork or potato masher.  Add the onions, mayonnaise and mustard, and mix well.  Stir in the olives and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cooking onions slowly over low heat imparts a rich, sweet flavor.  They're delicious when combined with hard-cooked eggs, mayonnaise and olives in this salad.  Serve plain or as a sandwich filling for an out-of-the-ordinary picnic.

          Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Pudding With Caramel Sauce

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  challah bread loaf
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
     3/4           cup  mashed overripe bananas - (abt 2 large)
  1 1/2           cups  maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3                     gratings fresh nutmeg - (to 4)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  mini chocolate chips
                        Caramel Sauce -- (see recipe)

Cut bread into 3/4-inch slices.  Trim away crust, then cut bread into 3/4-inch cubes, to make 8 cups.  Set aside any additional for another use.  Place bread in large bowl.

In separate medium bowl, whisk eggs until well beaten.  Whisk in milk, half-and-half, banana, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  Pour mixture over bread.  Add chocolate chips.  Mix with rubber spatula until bread is well moistened.  Set aside for 30 minutes.

Set rack in center of oven.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat an 8-inch round, nonstick cake pan (or deep-dish glass pie plate) with cooking spray.  Scoop soaked bread mixture into pan, filling it to top.

Bake until top is browned and puffed, and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Set on wire rack until almost completely cool.  Run sharp, thin knife around edge between pudding and pan.  Gently unmold pudding onto plate, then invert it back onto another plate, so browned side is up.

To serve, cut pudding, lukewarm or at room temperature, into 8 wedges.  Pour warm Caramel Sauce over and serve, with dollop of whipped cream if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 498 Cal; 11g Prot; 15g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 85g Carb.; 123mg  Chol; 341mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Tender challah helps make this one of the richest bread puddings ever.  Any other kind of egg bread can work; it might produce a slightly firmer pudding, but the result will still be irresistible.  Some people like this dessert equally well without the chocolate chips and cinnamon because it lets the richness of the eggs and dairy shine.

Cut bread into 3/4-inch slices.  Trim away crust, then cut bread into 3/4-inch cubes, to make 8 cups.  Set aside any additional for another use.  Place bread in large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In separate medium bowl, whisk eggs until well beaten.  Whisk in milk, half-and-half, banana, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  Pour mixture over bread.  Add chocolate chips.  Mix with rubber spatula until bread is well moistened.  Set aside for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set rack in center of oven.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat an 8-inch round, nonstick cake pan (or deep-dish glass pie plate) with cooking spray.  Scoop soaked bread mixture into pan, filling it to top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until top is browned and puffed, and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Set on wire rack until almost completely cool.  Run sharp, thin knife around edge between pudding and pan.  Gently unmold pudding onto plate, then invert it back onto another plate, so browned side is up.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, cut pudding, lukewarm or at room temperature, into 8 wedges.  Pour warm Caramel Sauce over and serve, with dollop of whipped cream if desired.

Comments:  Tender challah helps make this one of the richest bread puddings ever.  Any other kind of egg bread can work; it might produce a slightly firmer pudding, but the result will still be irresistible.  Some people like this dessert equally well without the chocolate chips and cinnamon because it lets the richness of the eggs and dairy shine.

  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- softened
     3/4           cup  peanut butter
  1                cup  demerara, turbinado or granulated sugar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TEMPEH CROUTONS ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce or tamari
  1            package  tempeh - (8 oz)
                        Chili powder -- as needed
                        === SALAD AND DRESSING ===
  8             ounces  soba or udon noodles
                        = (or linguine)
     1/3           cup  natural-style or reduced-fat peanut butter
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar or Sucanat
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce or tamari
     1/4           cup  hot water
  8             ounces  fresh mung bean sprouts
  3                     scallions, white and pale green parts -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro or parsley
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped peanuts -- (optional)

Make croutons:  In large skillet, heat oil and 1 tablespoon soy sauce over medium heat.  Break tempeh into cubes and add to skillet.  Cook, stirring often, until nicely browned and crisp.  Sprinkle lightly with chili powder and remove pan from heat.

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add noodles, stirring to prevent sticking.  Cook according to package directions, until al dente.

Meanwhile, in small bowl, whisk together peanut butter, lime juice, sugar, pepper flakes, 2 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari and water.  Set aside.

Drain noodles, rinse under cold running water and drain again.  In large serving bowl, combine noodles, bean sprouts, tempeh, scallions, cilantro and peanuts if using.  Whisk dressing and pour over salad; toss to coat.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 364 Cal; 19g Prot; 16g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 44g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 866mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Asian noodles have a tender texture that befits this delicately flavored salad.  Soba are Japanese buckwheat noodles shaped like spaghetti, and udon are traditional Japanese wheat noodles shaped like linguine.  Look for either in large supermarkets, natural food stores or Asian markets.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  couscous
  2               cups  fresh or frozen corn kernels
                        = (abt 4 ears if using fresh)
  1                cup  basil leaves - (packed) -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  diced jarred roasted red peppers
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice - (to 5)

In medium saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups water to boil over high heat.  Add couscous, stir and return to a boil.

Cover pan, remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.

In the meantime, bring another medium saucepan of water to boil over high heat.  Add corn, reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain well.

Fluff couscous with fork and transfer to large serving bowl.  Set aside to cool at room temperature.  Add corn, basil, peppers and onion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  chopped scallions, white and light green
  1                cup  thinly-sliced yellow bell pepper
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts
     1/3           cup  sesame seeds
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu -- cut 1/2"-thk slices,
                        drained well, patted dry - (abt 8 slices)
  4        tablespoons  roasted garlic oil or olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar

In medium bowl, mix scallions, bell pepper and bean sprouts.  Evenly divide vegetables between 2 plates.

Place sesame seeds on small plate.  Dredge tofu slices in sesame seeds to coat on all sides.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add tofu and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Evenly divide tofu between the 2 plates, leaning sesame tofu against vegetable mounds.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to skillet.  Add ginger and cook over medium heat, stirring often, 1 minute.  Stir in rice vinegar, bring to a boil, then remove from heat.  Drizzle tofu and vegetables with pan sauce.  Serve hot.

Per Serving: 334 Cal; 15g Prot; 24g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 10g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 18mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  This recipe produces tofu with a crisp, flavorful coating.  For the best texture, be sure to use extra-firm tofu and drain it well.  Regular sesame seeds work fine, but for a striking presentation, use black sesame seeds.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  cauliflower florets
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  6             medium  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  good-quality curry powder
  4             medium  carrots -- thinly sliced
  3               cups  chopped (2" pieces) green cabbage
  2        tablespoons  vegetable broth or water
  4               cups  cooked chickpeas
                        = (or rinsed and drained canned chickpeas)
     3/4           cup  coconut milk
  4 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped stemmed spinach
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

In wok, bring 2 1/2 quarts lightly salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add cauliflower and cook 2 minutes.  Drain well.

In wok, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat.  Add garlic, onion and 1 teaspoon salt and stir-fry 1 minute.  Add curry powder and stir-fry 1 minute.  Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil, carrots, cabbage and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and stir-fry 2 minutes.

Gradually drizzle broth around outer perimeter of vegetables (not in center).  Cover and cook 2 minutes.  Stir in chickpeas and coconut milk, and cook, uncovered, 2 1/2 minutes.

Add spinach, reserved cauliflower and cilantro and cook, stirring, just until spinach begins to wilt, about 1 minute, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 336 Cal; 14g Prot; 13g Total Fat (6 Sat. Fat); 46g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 857mg  Sod.; 14g Fiber.

Comments:  For this recipe, treat yourself to the regular coconut milk rather than the reduced-fat version -- it's luscious and flavorful.  Cauliflower is too dense and thick a vegetable to cook properly in a wok from raw, so it's precooked first.  Serve this curry with steamed basmati rice or toasted chapati or pita bread to catch all the savory sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  red lentils
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  mustard seeds
  1                     dried red chili
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1 1/2         pounds  precooked pre-cut baby potatoes
     1/2           cup  water -- stirred with
  1           teaspoon  curry powder -- or more to taste
     1/2           cup  additional water
  1                cup  frozen or fresh peas
                        Salt to taste
  2               cups  plain low-fat yogurt -- for garnish
  3        tablespoons  fresh coriander leaves -- for garnish

Bring 3 cups water to a boil in covered saucepan over high heat.  Rinse and pick clean lentils.  When water begins to boil, stir in lentils, brown sugar and turmeric, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender.

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add mustard seeds, chili and cumin seeds, and stir-fry for about 1 minute, letting seeds crackle.  Stir in garlic and ginger and cook 1 minute more.  Add potatoes and stir-fry for 10 minutes, or until potatoes brown.

Add 1/2 cup water blended with curry powder and stir thoroughly.  Continue cooking and stirring over medium heat until water evaporates.  Slowly add remaining 1/2 cup water a bit at a time, just until potatoes are tender.

When lentils are soft, stir them with peas and potatoes.  Add salt to taste.  Serve, garnishing each portion with yogurt and fresh coriander.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Suggestions:  While a cool mango lassi or freshly brewed cuppa Darjeeling tea could accompany this curry, so could a fruity, earthy Chardonnay.  Try MacRostie Carneros Chardonnay.

Description:
  "Using commercially packaged, pre-cut, blanched potatoes and split red lentils speeds up the cooking of this typical Indian curry."

Bring 3 cups water to a boil in covered saucepan over high heat.  Rinse and pick clean lentils.  When water begins to boil, stir in lentils, brown sugar and turmeric, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add mustard seeds, chili and cumin seeds, and stir-fry for about 1 minute, letting seeds crackle.  Stir in garlic and ginger and cook 1 minute more.  Add potatoes and stir-fry for 10 minutes, or until potatoes brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add 1/2 cup water blended with curry powder and stir thoroughly.  Continue cooking and stirring over medium heat until water evaporates.  Slowly add remaining 1/2 cup water a bit at a time, just until potatoes are tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When lentils are soft, stir them with peas and potatoes.  Add salt to taste.  Serve, garnishing each portion with yogurt and fresh coriander.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3              large  plum tomatoes -- quartered

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar or honey
     1/4           cup  white wine or water
  1           teaspoon  minced red bell pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced yellow bell pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced seeded serrano chiles -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh mint
  2             medium  honeydew, cantaloupe, crane or
                        other ripe melon
  8                     fresh figs -- cut into fans
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Edible flower petals -- if available

Combine sugar and wine in saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until sugar dissolves.  Add bell peppers and remove from heat.  Cool and add chiles, lime juice, mint and peppers.  Leftover syrup can be stored in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

To serve, cut melons in half and remove seeds.  Cut into decorative shapes and arrange attractively on chilled plates.  Spoon chile syrup over melons and garnish with fig fans and flower petals, if available.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 190 Cal; 2g Prot; 0g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 48g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 35mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The fruit with the chile demands a wine with residual sugar, fruity flavors and no oak aging.  Complementary Rieslings, Gew¸rztraminers, Chenin Blancs and Muscats all fall into this category.

Description:
  "In this dazzling combination, the hot chiles contrast with the cool melon.  This makes a perfect light summertime dessert or appetizer."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry active yeast
  1 1/4           cups  warm water
  2 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
                        extra for rolling
     1/4           cup  whole-wheat flour or
                        coarsely-ground rye flour
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  crushed fennel seed
                        Olive oil -- for brushing breads

Combine yeast and water in bowl of electric mixer.  Let rest until foamy, about 15 minutes.  Using paddle attachment, incorporate flours into yeast mixture.  Beat in salt and fennel seeds.  Switch to dough hook and knead for 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove dough and place into lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat.  Cover dough with plastic and allow to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch down, cover and let rise again until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Turn dough out onto work surface and divide into 8 balls, about 3 ounces each.  Place balls on floured cookie sheet, cover with damp towel and let rest for 20 minutes.  Dust work surface with flour and roll balls into 7-inch-round disks, dusting with flour, as needed.

Prepare hot charcoal or stovetop grill.  Lightly brush disks with olive oil.  Place disks, oiled-side down on grill.  The breads will begin to rise almost immediately.  When brown, flip over, brush again and cook until brown.  Remove from grill.

This recipe yields 8 breads.

Per Serving: 160 Cal; 5g Prot; 1g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 32g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 470mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  This flatbread is very versatile, and it can be grilled or cooked in a heavy skillet on the stovetop, under the broiler or in a preheated 500 degree oven on a pizza stone.  You can vary the flavor by adding minced fresh herbs or cracked black pepper to the dough.  Cover the dough and refrigerate after the first rise, then bake the next day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  6               cups  chopped seeded ripe tomatoes - (5 med)
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme

In Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add garlic and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring, 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes and thyme.  Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until tomatoes are saucy and have thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Stir in salt and pepper to taste.  (Sauce can be made ahead.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.)

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Per Serving: 110 Cal; 3g Prot; 4g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 19g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 180mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Fresh tomatoes, seasoned with woodsy thyme, produce a delicate tomato sauce, which is well suited to goat-cheese ravioli and other light pasta dishes.  This sauce has a rustic feel because the tomatoes are not peeled; if you prefer a more refined sauce, peel tomatoes by dipping them into boiling water, then slipping off skins.

Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- or more for
                        drizzling
     1/2         pound  fresh porcini mushrooms -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5 1/2         ounces  goat cheese (chËvre) -- at room temperature
  1            package  square wonton wrappers - (12 oz)

For filling, heat skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook porcini slowly, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until 1/3 cup very soft mushrooms remain.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and place in bowl.

Working over mushroom bowl, crumble goat cheese onto mushrooms and mix to form paste.

Spread clean towel on flat work surface to create shaped ravioli.  Have a damp cloth nearby to cover unused wonton wrappers, to keep them damp and pliable.  Place 2 wonton wrappers on flat surface.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in center of 1 skin.  Brush edges with water, making a wide border, and place another skin on top, matching edge to edge.  To press out air, press fingertips on top wrapper, shaping around filling and moving toward edges, tamping out any air pockets.  Press edges to seal.  If cutting ravioli with biscuit cutter, avoid cutting off "glued" edges.  Place finished ravioli on cloth and prevent them from touching.  Continue with all filling and skins.

To cook, heat 8 quarts water over high heat, adding pinch salt when boiling.  Add ravioli one at a time.  When ravioli float to surface and are translucent, scoop out with some pasta water and place in bowl.  Continue until all are cooked.  Drizzle drained ravioli with olive oil or melted butter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Per Serving: 620 Cal; 24g Prot; 26g Total Fat (10 Sat. Fat); 69g Carb.; 35mg  Chol; 870mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Porcini mushrooms have a very distinctive flavor, so the accompanying wine should highlight it.  Choose one with forward fruit and not too much oak.  Try Robert Sinskey Vineyards Aries California Pinot Noir.

Comments:  Making ravioli with purchased wonton wrappers is a cross-cultural miracle and saves the effort of hand-making whole sheets of fresh pasta dough.  Using a biscuit cutter, cut the ravioli into decorative scalloped rounds, or leave them in their original square shape.  Alternatively, you may use one wonton wrapper per ravioli and fold edges over the wrapper, making trianglesóthough you will have leftover wrappers.

If you cannot find fresh porcini mushrooms, substitute its cremini cousins.  Serve ravioli with a garden-fresh green salad.

  1                     lemon -- cut lengthwise
                        into 8 wedges for garnish
                        Basil Dip -- (see recipe)
  4                     strips roasted red pepper -- (optional)

To prepare artichokes:  Using your fingers, pull off the tough outer leaves just above the stem.  Trim and peel the stem; pare off the tough outer part with a knife.  Using scissors, snip off the thorny tips of the individual leaves.  To trim the top, place the artichoke on a cutting board and use a large knife to cut off the cluster of small leaves at the tip.

Cook artichokes in large pot of boiling water until knife inserted into base just above stem still meets some resistance, about 15 minutes.  (Do not worry about the artichokes floating as they cook.)  Using tongs, transfer artichokes to colander, stem up, and drain well.  When artichokes are cool enough to handle, using large, sharp knife, cut each artichoke in half lengthwise.  Using a teaspoon, scoop out the fluffy choke, leaving a teardrop-shaped cavity in the center of the artichoke.

Place tarragon, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag.  Add oil and shake the bag gently to blend.  Pack the artichokes into bag.  Seal bag and gently massage artichokes to coat them with marinade.  Place bag on a plate.  Refrigerate 24 hours, turning bag 3 to 4 times.

Heat gas or charcoal grill -- or ridged cast-iron griddle or skilletóuntil very hot.  Using tongs, arrange artichokes, cut-side down, on hot surface.  Cook until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes.  Turn and cook until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to four serving plates.

Serve with lemon wedges and Basil Dip.  If desired, garnish dip with strips of roasted red pepper.  Grilled artichokes can be kept, covered, at room temperature, up to 4 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  fine yellow cornmeal
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or butter -- plus
                        more oil for grilling

Lightly coat 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick olive-oil spray and set aside.

In medium saucepan, combine 4 1/4 cups water, cornmeal and salt; whisk well.  Cook polenta, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.  Add oil or butter and cook over low heat, stirring with wooden spoon and adding more water if necessary, a tablespoon at a time, to keep polenta from becoming too thick, about 30 minutes.  Scrape polenta into prepared pan and smooth top.  Cool, then cover pan and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat gas grill to medium or prepare charcoal fire.  When ready to grill, remove polenta from pan and cut into 1-inch-thick slices.  Brush both sides with oil and grill for 3 or 4 minutes each side.  Serve grilled polenta hot with grilled ratatouille.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Per Slice: 146 Cal; 3g Prot; 3g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 27g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 445mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  For best results, prepare the polenta the day before you grill it so it has enough time to become firm and sliceable.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     five-inch portobello mushrooms -- stemmed
  1             recipe  Sesame Ginger Marinade or
                        Lemon Herb Marinade -- (see recipes)
  4                     whole-wheat buns or hard rolls -- split, and
                        lightly toasted
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1                     small bunch arugula -- stemmed, and
                        leaves torn in half - (2 cups)
  8             ounces  soft goat cheese

Hold a mushroom, cut-side up, in your hand.  Using small sharp knife, carefully scrape to remove most of dark brown "gills."  Repeat with remaining mushrooms.

Prepare marinade in large, shallow glass dish.  Add mushrooms and turn to coat.  Let mushrooms marinate at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.

In medium bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil and mustard to make dressing.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Prepare hot charcoal fire or preheat gas grill on high.  Grill mushrooms, turning often, until tender and grill-marked, about 10 minutes.  Lightly toast rolls, if desired.

To assemble sandwiches, spread goat cheese on both sides of rolls.  Arrange mushrooms on bottom of each roll.  Add arugula to dressing in bowl and toss well.  Place arugula leaves on top of each mushroom, cover with bun tops and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Grilled Portobellos And Asparagus In Pesto Tortilla Roll-Up

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO ===
  3               cups  basil leaves -- washed, dried
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  2                     chunks Parmesan cheese -- (1/2" by 2") cubed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
                        === GRILLED PORTOBELLOS AND ASPARAGUS ===
  4              large  portobello mushroom caps -- stems discarded
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- woody stems removed
  2              large  flour tortillas - (10" dia) -- cut in half

For the Pesto:  Place basil, garlic and cheese cubes in food processor fitted with steel knife blade and process 2 to 3 minutes, or until cheese is grated and basil and garlic are finely chopped.  Add olive oil through feed tube and continue to process.

Stop, scrape down bowl and process again.  Add pine nuts and pulse to incorporate.

For the Grilled Portobellos And Asparagus:  Gently wipe mushroom caps with damp cloth to remove grit.  Brush mushrooms and asparagus with olive oil.  When grill or broiler is hot, place mushroom caps and asparagus on grill or under broiler.  Cook until flecked with brown and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from grill or oven, slice each cap into four strips and set aside.

Heat each half tortilla on ungreased skillet for about 1 minute per side over medium-high heat, until tortilla puffs.

Spread each warm tortilla half with 1/2 tablespoon pesto, and arrange mushroom strips and asparagus on top.  Roll up and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 190 Cal; 7g Prot; 6g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 27g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 200mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The basil, garlic and grilled mushroom components of this dish ask to be matched with Chardonnay, but the prominence of asparagus might kill the meeting.  So instead of a buttery, oaky, barrel-fermented Chardonnay, you should go for one made in a leaner style that is fresh and simple.  Try Lalande Vin de Pays des CÙtes de Gascogne.

Comments:  Grill the mushrooms and asparagus together on a grill or cook under the broiler.  The recipe for pesto makes nearly one pint -- enough for sandwiches and a pasta dinner as well.  Pesto also sparks the flavors of farm-fresh vegetables, whether grilled, poached or raw.  Refrigerate unused pesto.  It lasts for about four days sealed with a drizzle of olive oil.

Description:
  "While sandwiches make great lunches, they're also good for dinner when time is short.  This combination of aromatic basil, meaty mushroom and slightly crunchy asparagus is memorable for flavor as well as flair."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic head
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
                        vegetables
  3              large  tomatoes -- cored, and
                        halved crosswise
  1              small  eggplant -- cut 1"-thk rounds
  2              large  bell peppers -- cored, halved,
                        and seeded
  2             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise
  1                cup  canned chickpeas -- drained, rinsed
  2         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce -- (optional)

Preheat gas grill to medium or prepare charcoal fire.

Using sharp knife, slice off upper third from garlic head.  Place garlic head in sheet of aluminum foil, sprinkle with oil and loosely wrap.  Place on fairly hot section of grill and let cook while grilling vegetables, about 30 minutes.

Brush surfaces of tomato halves with oil and place on grill, skin side down.  Brush eggplant slices with oil and place on grill.  Trim white ribs from peppers; brush with oil and place on grill, along with halved zucchini.  (If there's not enough room, grill vegetables in stages.)  Sprinkle all vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.

Grill vegetables, sans tomatoes, using tongs to turn frequently, until tender but not overly charred.

When bell peppers are done, transfer to medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes.

Transfer remaining vegetables to large, shallow, casserole dish.

Scrape and discard charred skin from bell peppers.

Coarsely chop all vegetables and transfer to large saucepan.  Add chickpeas, basil, and salt and pepper to taste.

Remove garlic from foil, squeeze out several individual cloves and chop or mash.  Add to vegetables and mix well.  (Save remaining roasted garlic for another use.)

Over medium-low heat, gently heat ratatouille, stirring often and adding a little tomato sauce to moisten if desired.  Serve with grilled polenta slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Per Serving: 100 Cal; 5g Prot; 1g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 20g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 140mg  Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  This great-tasting dish can be made either ahead of time and rewarmed, or it can be prepared during the meal if you want to take a break and work the grill between dishes.  This is wonderful served with Grilled Polenta.

Comments:  To make Parmesan shavings, start with a 4-ounce chunk of cheese.  Use a swivel-edged vegetable peeler to shave off attractive curls, letting them fall onto a piece of wax or parchment paper.

             Jefferson's Polenta With Garden-Fresh Vegetables

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  coarse-ground yellow corn meal
  1 1/2           cups  grated fontina
  1 1/2           cups  grated Parmesan cheese
                        = (or other mild Italian cheese)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)

Bring salted water to a boil.  Slowly add cornmeal, whisking continuously.

When all cornmeal is added, reduce heat to low and continue whisking to remove any lumps.  Continue cooking while stirring with spoon, adding 1/2 cup fontina cheese, for about 25 minutes, or until mixture is thick.

Line 9-inch loaf pan with wax paper and lightly butter paper.  Scoop cornmeal into pan and set aside to firm.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter ovenproof baking dish.

Cut polenta into slices and place slices in overlapping layers in dish, dotting with butter and sprinkling with cheese.  Reserve cheese to sprinkle over top.

Bake polenta until cheeses melt and polenta forms crust, 10 to 15 minutes.  For final browning, place baking dish under broiler and cook until cheeses turn golden.  Remove and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 550 Cal; 21g Prot; 30g Total Fat (19 Sat. Fat); 49g Carb.; 90mg  Chol; 940mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Corn, butter, Parmesan, fontina!  Thomas Jefferson would probably serve wine from either France or Virginia.  Try Louis Latour 1996 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru or Linden Vineyards Chardonnay.

Comments:  Adapted from one of Thomas Jefferson's recipes, polenta, with its origins in Italy, resembles America's cornmeal mush, a staple in the US diet since the nation's very early days.  This makes a substantial entree, delicious with raw, steamed or sauteed farm-fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes, green beans or chard.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar -- or to taste
  2               cups  diced fresh mangos - (abt 1 1/2 mangos)
                        Juice of 1 lime
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger -- or to taste
  1                     container frozen apple juice - (10 oz)
  3        tablespoons  mango juice concentrate -- (optional)
                        Shredded lime zest -- for garnish

Combine water and sugar, and cook over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture turns slightly syrupy.

Combine sugar water and diced mangos in container of blender and process for 3 to 4 seconds; the mixture should still retain some mango texture.  Combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl and stir to combine well.  Pour mixture into ice cream freezer container and churn according to manufacturer's directions.

When firm, scoop mixture into container, cover, and freeze for 30 minutes, if needed to firm.  To serve, garnish each portion with lime zest.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Per Serving: 150 Cal; 0g Prot; 0g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 38g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 10mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Comments:  Fresh ginger makes a surprising addition to a frozen treat.  With its lively flavor, this sorbet enhances a main course or works equally well as a refreshing dessert.

              Maple-Grilled Pineapple Slices With Mascarpone

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  mascarpone
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Milk -- to thin cheese
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  butter
  6                     pineapple slices - (to 12)
                        Ground cinnamon -- for garnish
                        Toasted flaked coconut -- for garnish

In small bowl, combine mascarpone, sugar and vanilla.  Stir well with wooden spoon, adding enough milk, a tablespoon at a time, to make mixture smooth and creamy.  Cover and refrigerate.

Preheat gas grill to medium or prepare charcoal fire.  In small saucepan, combine maple syrup and butter and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.

Place pineapple slices on plate lined with paper towels, then blot slices dry with more towels.  Dunk slices into maple syrup, one or two at a time, then transfer to prepared grill.  Grill slices until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes each side.

Transfer pineapple slices to individual serving plates.  To serve, top with dollop of mascarpone, and dust with cinnamon and toasted coconut.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Per Serving: 310 Cal; 3g Prot; 22g Total Fat (12 Sat. Fat); 29g Carb.; 60mg  Chol; 25mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  You can use either drained, canned pineapple slices or fresh.  Fresh is a bit more durable and easier to handle on the grill.  If serving the latter, simply cut off the skin and cut the pineapple into thick slices.  You'll need either six large or 12 medium pineapple slices to make enough for six servings.

Description:
  "If you like the caramelized top of a pineapple upside-down cake, you'll love this.  The pineapple slices are dunked in maple syrup and butter, quickly grilled, then served with lightly sweetened mascarpone."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  bean sprouts - (5 oz)
  2               cups  broccoli florets
  4             ounces  whole-wheat udon noodles
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  roasted sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  preserved black beans
                        = (available in Asian markets)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh ginger
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  chile sauce
  4                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  vegetable broth
  8             ounces  smoked tofu -- diced
  2          teaspoons  black sesame seeds

Bring large pot of water to a boil.  Place bean sprouts in colander.  Plunge them into boiling water for 10 seconds, then run cold water over them until chilled, so they remain crisp.  Add broccoli to same pot and boil 3 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to bowl of cold water.

In same pot, cook udon, according to package instructions, about 8 minutes.  Rinse noodles under cold water and set aside.  This can all be done up to 8 hours ahead.  If so, store beans sprouts, broccoli and udon separately, tightly covered in refrigerator.

In large, nonstick skillet, heat both oils over medium-high heat.  Stir-fry beans, garlic, ginger, onion and chile sauce until onion softens, 3 minutes.  Add tomatoes and salt and cook until tomatoes soften, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Pour in wine and broth.  Boil vigorously until liquid reduces by a third, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add tofu, udon and broccoli, stir-frying until just heated through, about 2 minutes.

Divide noodles between 2 or 3 large shallow bowls.  Top each with bean sprouts and sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings.

  1                cup  fresh coriander leaves - (loosely packed) -- as garnish
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar - (to 3) -- or to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sesame oil
                        Juice of 1/2 large orange
                        Grated zest from 1 whole orange
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic

Bring pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and when at a rolling boil, add fresh noodles.  Cook for about 3 minutes, drain in colander and rinse well under cold water.  Set aside to continue draining.

Heat oil in wok over medium-high heat and stir-fry garlic and ginger until golden, about 2 minutes.  Remove from wok and set aside.

Add tofu, adding more oil as necessary, and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it turns golden.  Remove from wok.

Add scallions and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Add bok choy, adding more oil if necessary, and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until tender; add watercress and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Return garlic, ginger and tofu to wok and stir-fry 1 minute more.  Remove from heat.

To make dressing, combine all ingredients in small bowl and mix well.

Place noodles in large serving bowl and toss with half of dressing.  Add tofu and vegetables and toss with remaining dressing.  Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 360 Cal; 13g Prot; 21g Total Fat (13 Sat. Fat); 33g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 1100mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  Fresh Chinese noodles are sold at most Asian markets; however, you can substitute your favorite dried spaghetti-type pasta and cook according to package directions.  Dried pasta cooks more slowly than the fresh, so adjust preparation time.  Be sure to trim off and discard the tough ends of the bok choy.  For variety, use other leafy Asian greens, such as napa, choy sum or Chinese broccoli, or vegetables, such as bean sprouts or Chinese snow peas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried pasta
                        = (such as farfalle, rotini,
                        twists or shells)
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil with minced garlic
  1                     carrot -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced thin crosswise
  2               ears  corn cut from cob
                        = (or abt 1 cup frozen corn)
     1/2                green, red or yellow bell pepper -- diced
     1/3           cup  minced onion - (to 1/2)
  1                     tomato -- chopped
  1 1/3           cups  chickpeas - (to 2) -- drained, rinsed
  2        tablespoons  fresh snipped chives
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar - (to 1 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  water - (to 1 1/2)
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2          teaspoons  dried basil leaves -- crumbled
                        = (or 2 to 3 tbspns chopped fresh basil)

Cook pasta al dente according to package directions.  Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon oil mixed with garlic.

In bowl, combine carrot, corn, pepper, onion, tomato, chickpeas and chives.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss well.  Add pasta and toss to combine.

To make vinaigrette, mix remaining oil, vinegar, water, garlic and basil in bowl.  Season with salt and pepper, and blend well.  Drizzle vinaigrette over salad and toss well.  Let stand for 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

Per Serving: 230 Cal; 7g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 37g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 280mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Pasta salad is always better when made ahead.  The idea for tossing the just-cooked pasta with olive oil and garlic came from one of Julia Child's cookbooks some time ago.  If you do this when the pasta is hot, it absorbs the garlic flavor -- and makes for a better-tasting pasta salad.  Vary the vegetables, using peas, green beans or red or pink kidney beans in place of chickpeas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CILANTRO PESTO ===
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
  1 1/2           cups  cilantro leaves
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed, peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === ONION MIXTURE ===
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped sweet onion
                        = (such as Vidalia)
  1                cup  diced red bell pepper
  1                can  mild green chilies - (4 1/2 oz)
  12            ounces  dried orecchiette or gnocchi
                        = (or medium-shell pasta)
  1                cup  grated Pepper Jack cheese - (3 oz)

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Meanwhile, make pesto:  In small dry skillet, toast almonds over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until light golden and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl and let cool.

In food processor, combine almonds, cilantro, jalapeÒo, garlic, salt and pepper; process until finely chopped.  With motor running, add 2 tablespoons oil and lime juice through the feed tube, processing until mixture forms paste and stopping to scrape down sides of work bowl as necessary.  Transfer mixture to small bowl.

Add pasta to boiling water; stir to prevent sticking.  Cook, stirring often, until just tender, 8 to 12 minutes.  While pasta is cooking, in large nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring often, until tender, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add green chilies and cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Just before pasta is cooked, scoop out 1/3 cup of pasta cooking water and add to pesto, stirring well.  Drain pasta and transfer to large, warm bowl.  Add onion mixture and cheese; toss to coat well.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 580 Cal; 20g Prot; 22g Total Fat (5 Sat. Fat); 77g Carb.; 25mg  Chol; 550mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Comments:  You can also use the cilantro pesto as a condiment for grilled vegetables or thin it with yogurt and serve with baked tortilla crisps.

Per Serving: 540 Cal; 18g Prot; 37g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 39g Carb.; 15mg  Chol; 640mg  Sod.; 9g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Because the success of this salad depends on what you select at market, a light, dry white wine suits such a composed salad.

Comments:  A retro salad from the '70s, this recipe is adaptable to what's freshest and most appealing at market; layer to suit your whim.  For a vegan version, use soy mayonnaise.

Categories    : Desserts                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COBBLER ===
  9                     ripe medium peaches - (3 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4           cup  cold butter or margarine - (1/2 stick) -- cut small pieces
     2/3           cup  buttermilk
                        = (or plain low-fat yogurt)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Peel peaches by immersing them in boiling water for 1 minute.  Remove with slotted spoon.  Cool peaches under cold running water, then slip off skins.

Slice peaches into wedges directly into a 2-inch-deep, 2-quart baking dish or deep 10-inch pie plate (give knife a twist to release slices).  Toss peaches with lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar.  Cover fruit with foil, and bake until peaches are hot and juices bubble, about 15 minutes.

To make topping, in large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda.  Cut in butter with two knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles small peas.  Pour buttermilk over top.  Toss with fork until mixture clumps together.

Using two spoons, drop heaping tablespoonfuls of dough evenly spaced over peaches.

In small cup, mix remaining 2 teaspoon sugar and nutmeg.  Sprinkle over biscuits.

Bake until biscuits are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into them comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Remove cobbler to wire rack to cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 360 Cal; 10g Prot; 24g Total Fat (8 Sat. Fat); 29g Carb.; 15mg  Chol; 320mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Sweet juicy peaches are perfect for this dessert.  Select fruit that is unblemished and yields to gentle pressure when squeezed.  Sweetness does not increase after picking, so be selective.  To vary the cobber's filling, add some blueberries, strawberries or sliced plums.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  vegetable broth
  8                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     3/4           cup  low-fat firm silken tofu
  4          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed
  8             ounces  medium carrots - (abt 3) -- peeled
  12            ounces  dried penne pasta

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Meanwhile, in small saucepan, combine broth and garlic; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to low.  Cover and simmer until garlic is very tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

Transfer to blender or food processor.  Add tofu, olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste; process until smooth and creamy.

Return to saucepan. Warm over low heat but do not boil.  Stir in chives, tarragon, parsley and lemon zest.  Cover and keep warm.  (Sauce can be prepared ahead.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.  Reheat before continuing with recipe.)

Peel asparagus stalks, if desired, and cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths.  Cut carrots into 1 3/4- by 1/4-inch sticks.

Add pasta to boiling water, stirring to prevent sticking.  Cook, stirring often, until just tender, 9 to 11 minutes.  While pasta is cooking, place carrots in a steamer basket over boiling water.  Top with asparagus.  Cover and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

Drain pasta and transfer to large, warm bowl.  Add vegetables and reserved herb sauce; toss to coat.  Serve hot with lemon wedges for squeezing, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  tomatoes
  1              pound  dried penne pasta
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2              large  red bell peppers -- cut 1/4"-thk strips
  1              large  yellow summer squash -- halved lengthwise,
                        seeded and thinly sliced
  1                cup  sliced oil-cured black olives
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  32             large  basil leaves -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (to 1/2) -- optional

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Cut an "X" into bottom of each tomato and plunge tomato into boiling water, 30 seconds.  With slotted spoon, transfer to colander and rinse under cold running water.  Peel tomatoes, cut each in half crosswise, through equator, and squeeze out seeds.  Chop coarsely and set aside.

Add penne to boiling water and stir to prevent sticking.  Cook until just tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, in large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 3 minutes.  Stir in peppers and squash, and cook until tender, stirring often, about 5 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium.  Stir in tomatoes, olives, vinegar and salt, and cook until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add penne and toss until heated through.  Remove from heat and stir in basil and parsley.  Serve hot, sprinkled with cheese if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2               cups  baby spinach leaves - (tightly packed) -- rinsed
  1               pint  grape or cherry tomatoes -- rinsed
  4              large  eggs
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  low-fat ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  grated horseradish
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3         tablespoon  mayonnaise
                        Herb seasoning salt -- to taste

Place potatoes in pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and run under cold water.  Set aside in colander and pat potatoes dry before using.

Meanwhile, cook eggs and drain, peel and set aside to cool.

To make dressing, beat together ricotta cheese, buttermilk, horseradish, shallots, garlic, mayonnaise and seasoning salt in small mixing bowl.  Set aside.

Quarter cooked eggs.  Combine cooled potatoes, spinach and tomatoes in salad bowl.  Toss with dressing as needed and garnish salad with eggs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 350 Cal; 12g Prot; 8g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 63g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 600mg  Sod.; 9g Fiber.

Comments:  Using tender baby potatoes speeds up cooking time for making this favorite picnic salad.  If available, use baby Yukon Gold potatoes for their unusual color.  Serve with warm baguettes or a rustic Italian country bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     varicolored radishes - (to 8) -- with leaves intact
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
                        Sea salt -- to taste

Wash and trim radishes.  Set a dozen or so tender, fresh leaves aside.  Remove stems.  Thinly slice radishes into rounds.  Slice these crosswise into narrow strips.  Each strip should be tipped with color.  Chop or sliver leaves.

Beat butter with lemon zest until well combined.  Stir in sliced radishes, radish leaves and sea salt.

Spread butter on slices of crusty baguette and serve.

This recipe yields 50 servings.

Per Serving: 50 Cal; 0g Prot; 6g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 0g Carb.; 15mg  Chol; 40mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Comments:  A good radish sandwich can be nothing more than sweet butter spread on bread topped with sliced radishes and sea salt.  But you will find that a radish butter made earlier in the day is a simple way to get radishes to stay on sandwich bread to and a quick way to prepare lunch.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  creamy goat cheese
  1              large  egg
                        = (or equivalent egg substitute)
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh chives -- plus
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh savory or thyme
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  12            ounces  wonton wrappers
  2          teaspoons  butter
  1             recipe  Vegetable And Herb Broth or
                        Fresh Tomato Sauce With Thyme -- (see recipes)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

In medium bowl, beat goat cheese with electric mixer.  Add egg and beat until smooth and creamy.  (Alternatively, blend goat cheese and egg in food processor, then transfer to medium bowl.)  Add 1/3 cup chives, parsley, savory, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste; mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula.

Bring large, wide pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Lay about 12 wonton wrappers on clean work surface.  Using pastry brush, moisten edges with water.  Place a heaping teaspoonful of goat-cheese filling in center of each wrapper.  Top each with another wonton wrapper, pressing down gently on filling to flatten slightly.  Press wontons together around mounds of filling.  Using a 2-inch serrated round cutter, cut out circles, discarding trimmings.  Set ravioli on a baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining wontons and filling.  (Ravioli can be prepared ahead; cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.)

In large skillet, bring Vegetable And Herb Broth or Fresh Tomato Sauce With Thyme to a simmer over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low.  Stir in butter and keep sauce warm.

Drop half of ravioli into boiling water.  Cook until ravioli are tender and float to the surface, about 2 minutes.  With slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to topping in skillet.  Repeat with remaining ravioli.

Divide ravioli and topping among warm deep pasta plates.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon chives and Parmesan cheese, if desired.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm or extra-firm tofu -- drained
  1             recipe  Sesame Ginger Marinade -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  fresh Chinese wheat noodles
                        = (or linguine)
  1              pound  broccoli -- cut florets, and
                        stems julienned
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions
                        === DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  Asian sesame oil
     1/2           cup  peanut butter
     1/2           cup  vegetable broth
     1/4           cup  tamari or soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  chili paste with garlic
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Line baking dish with plastic wrap.  Cut tofu in half crosswise, then holding knife parallel to work surface, split each piece in half horizontally.

Place in baking dish and cover with plastic wrap.  Place plate on top and weigh down with several cans.  Refrigerate 30 to 45 minutes to press out excess moisture.

Prepare marinade in shallow glass bowl.

Remove tofu pieces from baking dish and blot tofu dry with paper towel; discard liquid.  Place tofu in bowl with marinade; turn to coat.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator for at least two hours or for up to one day, turning occasionally.

Bring large pot of water to a boil.  When water boils, add noodles, stirring to prevent sticking.  Cook noodles until tender according to package directions.  Drain, rinse under cold running water and drain again.  Transfer noodles to bowl.

Bring medium saucepan of water to boil.  Add broccoli and cook 2 minutes.  Drain, rinse broccoli under cold running water, and drain again.  Add broccoli to bowl with noodles.

To make dressing, in food processor or blender, combine all ingredients and process until smooth.  Set aside.

Preheat gas grill to medium-high or prepare a hot charcoal fire.

Remove tofu from marinade.  Grill tofu, basting occasionally with marinade, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

Just before serving, toss dressing with noodles and broccoli.  Transfer mixture to serving platter.  Arrange tofu on top and sprinkle mixture with scallions.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  margarine -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  3        tablespoons  cold water
  1 1/2           cups  firm silken tofu -- drained well
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2               cups  sliced strawberries
     1/2           cup  strawberry preserves

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In food processor, combine flour and salt and pulse on/off to mix.  Add margarine and process until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  With machine running, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and process until dough forms a ball.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface.  Roll dough into a 10-inch circle.  Place dough inside 9-inch tart pan.  Prick bottom of pastry several times with fork.  Bake until just lightly browned, 10 minutes.  Remove to wire rack to cool.

Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  In food processor, combine tofu, sugar and vanilla and process until well blended.  Pour mixture into cooled tart crust.  Bake until filling is set, about 30 minutes.  Remove to wire rack to cool.

To serve, arrange sliced strawberries on top of tart in a circular pattern until entire surface is covered.  Puree preserves in blender or food processor and brush over strawberries.  Chill at least 1 hour before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 259 Cal; 4g Prot; 41g Total Fat (8 Sat. Fat); 2g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 224mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Silken tofu replaces cream cheese in this delicious tart.  The pie may be topped with small whole strawberries instead of sliced ones or with other fresh berries.

  4             medium  juice oranges
  1                     wedge very ripe papaya - (abt 1") -- cut small chunks
  1                     overripe large banana -- cut 1" pieces
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  1                     ice cube

Squeeze juice from oranges and pour into blender; there should be about 3/4 cup.  Add papaya, banana, ginger and ice.  Blend until ice is crushed and mixture is creamy and golden.  Pour into tall glass and serve.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  Store-bought juice is watery compared to the juice you squeeze yourself, so roll up your sleeves.  This thick, blushing eye-opener is worth it.  It's a great way to use even bananas that have turned totally black, since the riper the banana, the creamier your juice will be.

     3/4           cup  reserved juice from canned pineapple
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
                        = (or white-wine vinegar)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch or arrowroot
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        = (or brown-rice syrup)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        === STIR FRY ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cut 1" squares
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- cut 1" squares
  8                     slender asparagus stalks - (to 10) -- tough ends trimmed,

                        juice reserved for sauce
  8             ounces  extra-firm tofu -- well drained, diced

Stir in tofu and reserved sauce and cook, stirring until mixture has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.  Taste and adjust flavor with additional honey, vinegar and/or soy sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This tasty and healthy stir-fry goes from pan to table in no time.  Because stir-frying is so fast, it's important to have all ingredients measured out and ready before you start cooking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  bulgur wheat
  1              pound  thin asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- chopped (1 cup)
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  crunchy sprouts, mixed bean sprouts or
                        radish sprouts
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  2             medium  carrots -- shredded (1 cup)
  1 1/2           cups  diced (1/2") tomatoes - (abt 2 med)
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice - (to 4)
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint -- (optional)
  1               head  Boston lettuce -- leaves separated

In medium saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil over high heat.  Stir in bulgur.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in medium skillet, combine asparagus pieces and 1/2 cup water.  Cover and simmer over high heat, 2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool.  Return asparagus to skillet with bell pepper and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Cook over high heat until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.

In large bowl, combine asparagus mixture, cooled bulgur and remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil.  Add remaining ingredients except lettuce and toss well.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve over lettuce leaves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 238 Cal; 7g Prot; 10g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 30g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 417mg  Sod.; 8g Fiber.

Comments:  This salad is chock-full of vegetables and is great as either a main or side dish.  You can substitute a 5-ounces box of tabbouleh mix for the bulgur; just omit the seasoning packet.

Toasted pita triangles served with hummus would make a nice accompaniment to this dish.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  red peppers -- cored
     1/2           cup  Wondra flour
                        = (or all-purpose flour)
  1 1/2           cups  Japanese bread crumbs (panko)
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil - (to 4)

Preheat broiler.  Place peppers on foil-lined baking sheet and flatten, using palm.  Broil peppers until skin is charred, about 8 minutes.  Remove peppers to brown paper bag, close and let steam for 15 minutes.  Using a small, sharp knife, remove charred skin from peppers.  Slice each pepper lengthwise into 6 to 8 pieces.

Spread Wondra and bread crumbs on separate sheets of waxed paper.  In shallow bowl, whisk eggs to blend.  Dip each pepper slice first into Wondra, shaking to remove excess, then into egg and finally into bread crumbs to cover.

Repeat until all peppers are coated with bread crumbs.

In large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat.  Cook peppers in batches until golden, turning once.  Drain on paper towels.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 235 Cal; 6g Prot; 11g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 28g Carb.; 85mg  Chol; 78mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Tempura is the Japanese method of frying vegetables and other foods.  The foods are first coated with dried white bread crumbs, called panko, which are crunchier than Western varieties.  Look for these bread crumbs in Asian markets and large supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  mixed summer squash -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        = (such as patty pans, crooknecks and
                        Rondes de Nice)
     1/2           cup  simmering water
     1/3           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped marjoram or oregano
                        = (or torn basil leaves)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in large skillet.  Add squash and cook over medium-low heat, flipping squash every 3 or 4 minutes, until tender and golden, about 20 minutes.  Add water and continue cooking until all water evaporates; take care not to burn vegetables.

Season with salt and pepper and shower squash with herbs.  Slide onto platter and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 80 Cal; 2g Prot; 5g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 7g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 5mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Regardless of color, shape or size, all summer squash cook in about the same amount of time, so you can combine and use any and all varieties you find at the market.  Try the Ronde de Nice, an interesting round squash.

Comments:  Regardless of color, shape or size, all summer squash cook in about the same amount of time, so you can combine and use any and all varieties you find at the market.  Try the Ronde de Nice, an interesting round squash.

        Tomato, Black Olive And Chickpea Stew With Fresh Shiitakes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  chopped onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed,
                        and minced
     1/4         pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems chopped fine,
                        and caps cut into 1/2"-thick slices
     1/3           cup  white wine
  3               cups  whole peeled tomatoes
  1 1/3           cups  chickpeas -- drained, rinsed
  1         tablespoon  salt-packed capers -- unrinsed
     1/2           cup  oil-cured black olives -- pitted
  1         tablespoon  crumbled dried or minced fresh oregano
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Using Dutch oven or other enameled cast-iron pot, heat over medium heat and add olive oil.  When oil is fragrant, reduce heat to medium-low and cook onions until translucent but not golden.  Add garlic and mushrooms, and stir until soft and partially cooked, about 3 minutes.  Add wine and cook another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking.

Add tomatoes, chickpeas, capers, olives, oregano, salt and pepper.  Cook 15 minutes more, or until heated through.  Set aside, covered, until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 170 Cal; 5g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 20g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 340mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Zinfandel can stand up to the fruity acidity of the tomatoes and the fleshy, full-mouth feel of olives.  California Zinfandel has enjoyed a string of good vintages for nearly 10 years.  Try Fife Vineyards Napa Valley Old Vines Zinfandel.

Comments:  While this stew is wonderful warm served over rice, it's surprisingly good cold.  Pour leftovers over cottage cheese for a satisfying lunch or quick dinner.  The flavors meld as the stew sits, so it can even be made early in the day and served at room temperature.  A delicious dried, assertive oregano to use is the Greek rigoni.

     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In large pot, combine 8 cups water, leeks, celery, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns and salt; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 1 1/2 hours.  Strain broth through a fine sieve, pressing on solids to extract maximum flavor.

Place broth in medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until reduced to 2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes.  (Broth can be made ahead.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.)

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    ripe apricots - (to 16) -- halved
  1               pint  raspberries -- or more
                        = (or wild strawberries)
  1                     fresh lavender stem - (to 2) -- flowers separated
  1           teaspoon  lavender or wildflower honey
                        = (or granulated sugar)
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
                        Few drops fresh lemon juice

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly butter baking dish large enough to accommodate fruit in single layer.

Lay apricots in single layer in prepared dish.  Sprinkle lavender blossoms over apricots and drizzle honey over fruit.  Sprinkle strawberries over fruit and coat very lightly with sugar.  Carefully squeeze lemon juice over fruit.

Bake just long enough to warm fruit and bring out its aromas, about 15 minutes.  Remove and serve warm, plain or with a little fresh cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 90 Cal; 2g Prot; 0g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 21g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 0mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Comments:  Delicate just-picked fruits from the farmers' market stand a better chance of being really good than any fruit shipped from far way, assuring you of a flavor that needs little enhancement.  Use fresh sweet lavender or dried lavender flowers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Wehani rice
  1 3/4           cups  water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  onion or mushroom food base -- (optional)
                        = (available in natural-food stores)
  2               cups  fresh seasonal vegetables -- or more
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water; drain well.

Transfer rice to rice cooker bowl.  Add water and food base if using; stir.  Close lid and set on regular/brown rice cycle.  About 10 minutes before rice cycle is completed, add vegetables on top of rice and continue cooking.

When machine switches to keep-warm cycle, let rice and vegetables sit about 10 minutes.  Serve with sprinkling of cheese.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings.

Per Serving: 330 Cal; 10g Prot; 3g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 64g Carb.; 5mg  Chol; 150mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Wehani rice, bred by the Lundberg family of Northern California, packs such a wallop of nutty flavor that it needs little embellishment.  Top with whatever vegetables are in season.  Experience will teach you when the rice is about 10 minutes from being done, so you can add the vegetables.

            Zucchini Soup With Cinnamon, Cumin And Buttermilk

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Free                        Soups/Stews
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
  1              pound  zucchini -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut into chunks
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
     1/2      teaspoon  minced seeded serrano chile -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seed
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh coriander or mint and lime
                        or lemon juice for garnish

Place broth in large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Add zucchini, reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until zucchini is barely tender and still bright green.  Remove from heat and cool.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil over medium heat in nonstick skillet.  Add onion, chile, fennel, cinnamon and cumin, and cook, stirring often, until onion is soft.

Place both mixtures into food processor and pulse until well chopped but textured.  Pour into bowl, stir in buttermilk and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Chill for at least 2 hours.  Serve garnished with sprinkling of fresh coriander and lime juice to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Per Serving: 110 Cal; 5g Prot; 5g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 14g Carb.; 5mg  Chol; 490mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The tart buttermilk, fresh herbs and spices would go best with a crisp, clean, chilled white wine with similar flavors such as a Sauvignon Blanc, Roussane or Marsanne.  Italian whites, such as Pinot Grigio, and Spanish whites, such as Albarino, would also work.

Comments:  Bolster this simple soup's flavors by adding vegetables such as sautÈed mushrooms, sweet peas or corn.
