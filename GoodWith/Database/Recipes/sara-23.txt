Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salted Cod                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ACRAS BATTER ===
  1                cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
                        === CODFISH ===
     1/2         pound  salted codfish -- flaked
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  2             sprigs  flat-leaf parsley
  1                     scallion, including green top
  2                     chives
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2                Scotch Bonnet chile
                        Corn oil -- for frying

For the batter, mix the flour and the seasoning together in a medium-size bowl.  Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and break the eggs into the well 1 at a time while beating the mixture until it has become a thick, uniform paste.  Cover the bowl with a dampened cloth and allow it to rest for 1 to 4 hours.

For the fish, place the flaked codfish, thyme, parsley, scallion, chives, allspice, and chile in the bowl of a food processor and grind them together into a thick paste.  Fold this paste into the acras batter.

Meanwhile, heat 2 inches of corn oil to 350 to 375 degrees in a heavy cast-iron pot or deep fryer.  Drop the acras into it by the teaspoonful.  Fry until they are light brown, turning once.  When done, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  untoasted pine nuts - (10 oz)
  8             ounces  almond paste
  1                cup  superfine sugar
  2              large  egg whites -- room temperature

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 cookie trays with parchment paper or aluminum foil.  Spread the pine nuts onto a jelly-roll pan lined with waxed or parchment paper.

Break the almond paste into chunks and place in the bowl of a food processor.  Add the sugar and process until the mixture is homogenous, stopping once to scrape down the bowl using a rubber spatula.  Add the egg whites and process until smooth.  Scrape again and process for a few more seconds.

The mixture will be sticky, but with a light touch and moist hands it can be gently rolled.  Keep a damp towel nearby to wipe and wet your hands.  Using damp hands, round the mix into scant 1-inch balls and drop the balls onto the tray of pine nuts.  Once you have 3 to 4 balls formed, roll them in the nuts to cover completely.  Place about 16 balls 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.

Bake the first tray while preparing the second, until the cookies are pale golden, and puffy, about 25 minutes.  Place the baking sheets on wire cooling racks and cool the cookies completely before lifting them off.  Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days, or freeze for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields 30 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3                     Golden Delicious apples -- plus
  3                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        sliced thin and tossed with
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  flour
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4                cup, sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- chilled
     2/3           cup  half-and-half
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla

To prepare filling; melt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat, add apple slices and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes.  Mix sugars, cinnamon, nutmeg salt and cornstarch in a bowl and gently stir mixture into apples.  Continue to cook until apples are soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes.

To prepare topping; mix together flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.  Using 2 knives or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the milk and vanilla, and quickly blend together with spatula.

To assemble the pie; drop heaping tablespoons of biscuit mixture on top of apples, covering most of the center of the mixture.  Sprinkle top with remaining sugar and bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until top is golden.  Remove pie from oven and let stand for at least 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  4                     ripe bananas
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  rum

Place the raisins in the orange juice until they expand.  Meanwhile, peel the bananas and slice them in half lengthwise.

Heat the butter in a large frying pan and add the bananas, round-side down.  Cook the bananas for 2 to 3 minutes on each side turning them carefully with a spatula so as not to break them.  Mix the sugar and nutmeg with the raisins and juice and pour it over the bananas.

When ready to serve, remove the bananas from the frying pan, reserving the cooking juices, and arrange them on a hot plate.  Heat the cooking juices to boiling, and add rum, and light it, pouring it over the bananas.  The alcohol will burn off, leaving you with a rummy flavor on the sautÈed bananas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  asparagus, the thicker the better
  2        tablespoons  salt -- for boiling water

Bring about 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil in a covered pot large enough to hold the asparagus.  Cut the bottom section -- usually about 1 to 2 inches -- off the asparagus stalks with a sharp knife.  Peel the asparagus by laying them flat, one at a time, on a cutting board.

If the asparagus are thinner than 1/2-inch, use a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus starting at the base of the tip and peeling them all the way down to the base, eliminating the fibrous peel and revealing the pale green flesh.  If the asparagus are very thick or woody, use a paring knife and start peeling from the base.

When ready to cook, toss the salt into the boiling water and carefully lower in the asparagus.  Turn the heat to low and simmer the asparagus, uncovered, until the spears are easily penetrated with a knife, usually after about 5 minutes but from 1 minute for very thin asparagus to 12 minutes for the very thickest.  If serving cold asparagus, plunge the hot cooked asparagus into ice water or rinse under cold water in a colander.  Pat dry.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Basic Sticky Rice

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  long-grain Thai sticky rice

Soak the rice in a container that holds at least twice the volume of rice.  Cover the rice with 2 to 3 inches of room-temperature water and soak for 6 to 24 hours.  If you need to shorten the soaking time, soak the rice in warm (about 100 degree) water for 2 hours.  The longer soak gives more flavor and a more even, tender texture, but the rice is perfectly edible with the shorter soak in warm water.

Drain the rice and place in a steamer basket.  Set the steamer basket over several inches of boiling water in a large pot or a wok.  The rice must not be in or touching the boiling water.  Cover and steam for 25 minutes, or until the rice is shiny and tender.

Turn the rice over after about 20 minutes, so the top layer is on the bottom.  Be careful that your pot doesnít run dry during steaming; add more water if necessary, making sure to keep it from touching the rice.

Turn the cooked rice out onto a clean work surface.  Use a long-handled wooden spoon to flatten it out a little, then turn it over on itself, first from one side, then from the other, a little like folding over dough as you knead.  This helps get rid of any clumps; after several foldings, the rice will be an even round lump.

Place it in a covered basket or in a serving bowl covered by a damp cloth or a lid.  Serve warm or at room temperature, directly from the basket or bowl.  The rice will dry out if exposed to the air for long as it cools, so keep covered until serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings or 6 1/2 cups.

  16                    paper muffin-cup liners - (2 1/2" dia)
  2               cups  cake flour (not self-rising)

                        cut into quarters

                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  diced yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
     1/2           cup  minced seeded chile pasilla
     1/2           cup  minced seeded chile ancho
     1/2           cup  peeled and seeded roasted poblano chile
  1             gallon  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  grated bittersweet chocolate
     1/2           cup  diced pineapple
     1/2           cup  white bread torn into small pieces
     1/2           cup  crushed ripe plantains
                        = (banana may be substituted)
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic

In a heavy cast-iron pot or Dutch oven, heat the sesame oil over a fire.  Rub the pieces of duck with the salt and pepper, and then brown them in the hot sesame oil until they have a rich, brown color.  Remove the pieces of duck and set aside in a warm place.

Scrape the seed from the vanilla bean into the mixture.  Bring the mixture to a boil and the decrease the heat to a simmer by moving the pot to the side of the fire.  Let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove from the heat and puree the mole -- do not seal the blender airtight while pureeing a hot liquid -- and then return it to the pot.  Put the pieces of duck in the mole and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the duck from the mole and serve with the sauce on the side.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  finely-minced onions
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1 1/2           cups  ground meat

                        veal plus 3 ounces fresh pork fat)
  1                     garlic clove -- mashed
     1/8      teaspoon  fresh thyme
  1              pinch  allspice
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  1                     egg
  2 1/2         pounds  lean beef, top round or chuck -- cut into 18
                        cross-grain slices 1/4"-thk
                        and about 3" in diameter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  oil
     1/2           cup  sliced carrots
     1/2           cup  sliced onions
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  Brown Chichen Stock -- (see recipe)
  1              piece  fresh pork rind - (4" square) -- simmered in water
                        for 10 minutes
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (1 clove garlic, 6 parsley sprigs, 1 bay
                        leaf, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 clove, tied togeth
                        in a cheesecloth)
  2        tablespoons  parsley
  2        tablespoons  buerre manie
                        = (butter and flour in same proportions,
                        kneaded together to a paste)

Cook the onions slowly in butter for 7 to 8 minutes until they are tender but not browned.  Scrape them into a mixing bowl.  Add ground meat, 1 clove mashed garlic, 1/8 teaspoon fresh thyme, pinch allspice, pinch pepper, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup chopped parsley, 1 egg and beat vigorously until thoroughly blended.

Flatten each slice of beef to a thickness of 1/8-inch by pounding it between 2 sheets of paper with a mallet or a rolling pin.  Lay the meat flat on a board and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Divide the stuffing into 18 portions and place one portion on the lower thirds of each veal slice.  Roll the meat around the stuffing to form cylinders about 4 inches long and 1 1/2 inches thick.  Secure each with 2 ties of string.  Dry in paper towels.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a casserole until almost smoking.  Brown the roulades lightly, a few at a time and remove to a platter.  Lower the heat to moderate and slowly brown 1/2 sliced carrots and 1/2 cup sliced onions for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring.  Add 1 cup white wine and 1 1/2 cups brown stock.

Lay the 4-inch piece of pork rind in the casserole.  Place the roulades over it and add more stock or water if necessary, so the roulades are barely covered.  Add the herb bouquet.  Bring to a boil on the stove and simmer slowly for 1 1/2 hours.

Remove roulades form casserole.  Strain the liquid into a saucepan and degrease.  Reduce liquid down to 1 1/2 to 2 cups.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons beurre manie.  Bring to a boil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle sauce over roulades.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Stocks


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             pounds  meat and bones of chicken -- chopped 2" to 3" pie
                        = (backs, necks, wings are best)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2                     carrots -- scraped
  2                     onions -- peeled
  2                     celery stalks
  2                     leeks -- washed
                        === BOUQUET GARNI ===
                        Into a cheesecloth tie:
  4                     thyme stems
  1                     bay leaf
  6                     parsley sprigs
  2                     unpeeled garlic cloves
  5                     peppercorns

Brown meat, bones and vegetables either in batches in a heated stockpot, oil added.  Or place all meat, bones and vegetables on baking sheet and brown in oven and then add to stockpot.  When browned, add cold water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a simmer at medium heat.  As the liquid starts to simmer, scum will rise.  Remove it with a ladle for about 20 minutes until it stops to accumulate.

Add the vegetables and the bouquet garni and add more water if necessary -- water should cover all ingredients by 1 inch.  When liquid is simmering again, skim as necessary.  Keep at a simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.  Skim fat and scum occasionally.  Boiling water should be added if the liquid evaporates below the level of all ingredients.

Never allow the liquid to boil to avoid fat and scum incorporating themselves into the liquid and making it cloudy.  Cooking may be stopped at any time and continued later.  Never cover the pot totally until contents have completely cooled -- otherwise the stock will turn sour.

After 4 to 5 hours of cooking, strain the stock out of the stockpot into a bowl.  Press on the vegetables to squeeze out all the liquid.  Discard the vegetables.  Let stock settle for 5 minutes.  Remove fat from its surface with a ladle, then draw paper towels over the surface of the stock to blot up last traces of fat.  Or put the stock into the refrigerator, uncovered, until fat on top has hardened and can be scraped off.

Taste the degreased stock for taste.  Boil it down to evaporate some of its water content and to concentrate its strength.  Chill in ice-bath.  Cover and refrigerate it, or bottle and freeze it.  Stock kept in the refrigerator must be brought to the boil every 3 or 4 days to keep it from spoiling.

Brown meat, bones and vegetables either in batches in a heated stockpot, oil added.  Or place all meat, bones and vegetables on baking sheet and brown in oven and then add to stockpot.  When browned, add cold water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a simmer at medium heat.  As the liquid starts to simmer, scum will rise.  Remove it with a ladle for about 20 minutes until it stops to accumulate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the vegetables and the bouquet garni and add more water if necessary -- water should cover all ingredients by 1 inch.  When liquid is simmering again, skim as necessary.  Keep at a simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.  Skim fat and scum occasionally.  Boiling water should be added if the liquid evaporates below the level of all ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Never allow the liquid to boil to avoid fat and scum incorporating themselves into the liquid and making it cloudy.  Cooking may be stopped at any time and continued later.  Never cover the pot totally until contents have completely cooled -- otherwise the stock will turn sour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 4 to 5 hours of cooking, strain the stock out of the stockpot into a bowl.  Press on the vegetables to squeeze out all the liquid.  Discard the vegetables.  Let stock settle for 5 minutes.  Remove fat from its surface with a ladle, then draw paper towels over the surface of the stock to blot up last traces of fat.  Or put the stock into the refrigerator, uncovered, until fat on top has hardened and can be scraped off.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Taste the degreased stock for taste.  Boil it down to evaporate some of its water content and to concentrate its strength.  Chill in ice-bath.  Cover and refrigerate it, or bottle and freeze it.  Stock kept in the refrigerator must be brought to the boil every 3 or 4 days to keep it from spoiling.

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP ===
  3                     blocks tofu - (abt 1 lb)
     1/4           cup  tamarind pulp -- dissolved in
  1                cup  hot water
     1/2         pound  okra - (abt 2 cups)
  5               cups  water
     3/4           cup  fresh pineapple in 1/4" chunks
  1              stalk  bac ha (giant taro) -- (optional),
                        cut 1 1/2" lengths,
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2             medium  tomatoes -- cut into wedges
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
                        === GARNISH AND FLAVORINGS ===
     1/4           cup  peanut or vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped shallots
  2               cups  bean sprouts - (to 3) -- rinsed, drained
  12                    Asian basil leaves -- coarsely torn
  6             sprigs  rice paddy herb (ngo om) -- (optional)
  2                     bird or serrano chiles - (to 4) -- minced

For the soup, place the tofu blocks on a plate, place another plate on top, and weight with a jar or 14 to 28-ounce can.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  Water will be pressed out of the tofu as it stands; drain it off every 15 minutes or so.  Cut the tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and set aside.

Use your fingers to squeeze and press the tamarind to dissolve it completely and to squeeze the last of the pulp off any seeds and pith.  Place a sieve over a small bowl and pour the tamarind water through.  Discard any solids and set the liquid aside.

If the okra is large, cut crosswise in half and cut off any tough tips, leaving the stems on.

For the garnish, heat the oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and cook until well-browned, then remove from the heat and set aside.

To make the soup, place the tamarind liquid and the 5 cups water in a large nonreactive pot.  Bring to a vigorous boil, then add the okra (if your okra is very fresh and tender, add it later, with the tomato wedges) and pineapple.

Boil vigorously for 3 minutes, then add the bac ha, if using, the sugar, salt, and tomato wedges.  Bring back to a boil, then add the tofu cubes and soy sauce and cook for 2 minutes.  Taste and adjust the balance of seasonings if you wish.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  well-shaken buttermilk

  4             ounces  coarsely-grated extra-sharp cheddar -- (1 cup)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped scallion, white/pale green 
  1        tablespoons  finely-chopped drained pickled jalapeÒos -
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted

                            Chocolate Souffle

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jacques Torres
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2         ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  8              large  egg whites
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting
                        Heavy cream -- (optional), whipped
                        to stiff peaks
                        CrËme Anglaise -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Use a pastry brush to evenly coat the inside of a 1 1/2-quart soufflÈ mold with softened butter.  Fill the mold with granulated sugar, then pour out the excess.  If you have properly buttered the mold, the sugar will stick to the side and bottom of it.  The butter and sugar keeps the soufflÈ from sticking to the side of the mold and allows it to rise evenly.  The sugar also gives the soufflÈ a crunchy crust.

Place a double boiler 1/2 filled with water over high heat and bring to a boil.  Place the chopped chocolate in the top of the double boiler and melt until quite hot.  Stir occasionally.

Place the eggs, sugar and lemon in another double boiler placed over boiling water.  Whisk the egg mixture until lukewarm.  Remove the egg mixture from the heat and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer.  Whip to stiff peaks.  While the egg mixture is whipping, check the chocolate.  It should be hot to the touch.  Stop the mixer.  Use a rubber spatula to fold the hot chocolate into the whipped egg whites.

Use a rubber spatula to gently place the soufflÈ mixture in the buttered and sugared mold.  Fill to about 1 inch above the rim of the mold.  Place the soufflÈ in the center of the oven and allow enough room for it to rise.  If the soufflÈ is too close to the top of the oven or under a rack, it will stick when it rises.  If the soufflÈ is too close to the bottom of the oven, the bottom of the soufflÈ will burn before the inside is properly baked.

Bake until the soufflÈ has risen 1 1/2 times in height and starts to brown on top, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and dust the top with the powdered sugar.  Serve immediately with a side of whipped cream or CrËme Anglaise.

This recipe yields 1 (8-inch) soufflÈ; 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This soufflÈ can also be baked in buttered and sugared individual-size molds.  Use a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip) to pipe the soufflÈ mixture into the molds about 1 inch above the rim.  Bake until risen in height and lightly browned on top, 6 to 8 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Use a pastry brush to evenly coat the inside of a 1 1/2-quart soufflÈ mold with softened butter.  Fill the mold with granulated sugar, then pour out the excess.  If you have properly buttered the mold, the sugar will stick to the side and bottom of it.  The butter and sugar keeps the soufflÈ from sticking to the side of the mold and allows it to rise evenly.  The sugar also gives the soufflÈ a crunchy crust.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a double boiler 1/2 filled with water over high heat and bring to a boil.  Place the chopped chocolate in the top of the double boiler and melt until quite hot.  Stir occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the eggs, sugar and lemon in another double boiler placed over boiling water.  Whisk the egg mixture until lukewarm.  Remove the egg mixture from the heat and pour into the bowl of a stand mixer.  Whip to stiff peaks.  While the egg mixture is whipping, check the chocolate.  It should be hot to the touch.  Stop the mixer.  Use a rubber spatula to fold the hot chocolate into the whipped egg whites.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use a rubber spatula to gently place the soufflÈ mixture in the buttered and sugared mold.  Fill to about 1 inch above the rim of the mold.  Place the soufflÈ in the center of the oven and allow enough room for it to rise.  If the soufflÈ is too close to the top of the oven or under a rack, it will stick when it rises.  If the soufflÈ is too close to the bottom of the oven, the bottom of the soufflÈ will burn before the inside is properly baked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the soufflÈ has risen 1 1/2 times in height and starts to brown on top, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and dust the top with the powdered sugar.  Serve immediately with a side of whipped cream or CrËme Anglaise.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 (8-inch) soufflÈ; 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This soufflÈ can also be baked in buttered and sugared individual-size molds.  Use a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip) to pipe the soufflÈ mixture into the molds about 1 inch above the rim.  Bake until risen in height and lightly browned on top, 6 to 8 minutes.

             Chocolate Souffle Cake With Orange Caramel Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut into pieces,
                        plus more for cooking
  9             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (not unsweetened chocolate)
  6              large  eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  superfine granulated sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  superfine granulated sugar
  3                     navel or Valencia oranges

Cake:  Put a small roasting pan filled halfway with hot water in bottom 1/3 of oven (to provide moisture during baking), then preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a 10-inch springform pan and line bottom with a round of parchment or wax paper.  Butter paper.

Melt butter and chocolate together in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring, then remove from heat.  Beat together yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until thick and pale, and ribbons form when beater is lifted, about 6 minutes.

Beat whites at medium speed with cleaned beaters in another large bowl until they just hold soft peaks.  Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar, beating until whites just hold stiff peaks.

Stir warm chocolate mixture into yolk mixture until combined well.  Stir 1/4 of egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining egg whites gently but thoroughly.

Pour batter into springform pan and bake in middle of oven (do not place springform pan in pan of hot water) until a tester inserted in center comes out with crumbs adhering, about 1 hour (a crust will form and crack on top of cake as it bakes).

Transfer to a rack and cool 10 minutes (cake will "deflate" as it cools).  Run a thin knife carefully around edge of cake, then remove side of pan.  Cool cake on bottom of pan 30 minutes, then invert onto another rack or plate.  Remove bottom of pan, then carefully peel off parchment.  Invert cake onto serving plate.

Sauce:  Remove zest from 2 oranges and trim any white pith from zest.  Cut zest into enough very thin strips to measure 1/4 cup.  Squeeze juice from 3 oranges and strain through a fine sieve.  Measure out 1 cup juice.

Cook remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a dry heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt.  Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar has melted into a deep golden caramel.  Add zest and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 15 seconds.

Tilt pan and carefully pour in juice (caramel will harden and steam vigorously).  Cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved, then cool sauce.  Serve cake with orange sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  We recommend making this cake 1-day ahead to allow flavors to develop.  Keep chilled, covered with plastic wrap.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  24                    extra-large Bluepoint oysters -- shucked

  2                     lemons -- each cut
                        into 4 to 6 wedges for garnish

Place the cornmeal, flour, and eggs in separate dishes.  Dip each oyster, first into the flour, then the egg, then the cornmeal to evenly coat.  Place the coated oysters on a baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to fry.

Pour the oil into a deep-fat-fryer or 4-quart heavy saucepan.  Heat the oil over high heat to 350 degrees (if you drop a small amount of the cornmeal mixture into the oil and it sizzles, itís hot enough).  To prevent the coated oysters from sticking together, carefully drop them into the heated oil 1 at a time.

Fry the oysters, a few at a time, for 2 minutes, until golden.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the oysters from the oil and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

               Crisp Duck Breast With Pink Peppercorn Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  boneless duck breasts with skin,
                        such as Long Island - (abt 1 1/2 lbs ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                     container duck-and-veal demiglace - (6 1/2
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-crushed peppercorns -- (preferably pink)

Halve duck breasts and trim excess fat.  Pat duck dry.  Pierce skin of duck all over with a fork and score with a knife to allow fat to drain and help skin become crisp.  Season duck with salt.

Heat a large heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until very hot.  Put duck, skin-sides down, in skillet and immediately reduce heat to moderately-low.  Cook duck 20 minutes, or until skin is mahogany-colored and most of fat is rendered.

Remove fat from skillet with a metal bulb baster or by very carefully pouring it off.  Turn duck over and cook 2 minutes more.  Transfer duck to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes.  (Duck will continue to cook as it stands until it reaches medium.)

While duck is standing, in a small saucepan boil demiglace until reduced to about 3/4 cup and add vinegar, sugar, and peppercorns.  Remove pan from heat and keep sauce warm, covered.  Diagonally cut duck breast halves and serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Halve duck breasts and trim excess fat.  Pat duck dry.  Pierce skin of duck all over with a fork and score with a knife to allow fat to drain and help skin become crisp.  Season duck with salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a large heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until very hot.  Put duck, skin-sides down, in skillet and immediately reduce heat to moderately-low.  Cook duck 20 minutes, or until skin is mahogany-colored and most of fat is rendered.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove fat from skillet with a metal bulb baster or by very carefully pouring it off.  Turn duck over and cook 2 minutes more.  Transfer duck to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes.  (Duck will continue to cook as it stands until it reaches medium.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
While duck is standing, in a small saucepan boil demiglace until reduced to about 3/4 cup and add vinegar, sugar, and peppercorns.  Remove pan from heat and keep sauce warm, covered.  Diagonally cut duck breast halves and serve with sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  3        tablespoons  madras-type curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red chiles
     1/2           cup  cane vinegar -- or more if needed
  3             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut into strips
  4              large  potatoes -- peeled, chopped

In a large frying pan, heat the butter and sautÈ the onion, garlic, and ginger until the onion is soft, but not brown.  Add the curry powder and chiles, stirring so that they do not stick or burn.  Add the vinegar.  There should be enough to make a smooth paste.  (You may need up to 1/4 cup more vinegar.)

Cover the chicken pieces with the paste and place them in a covered bowl in the refrigerator.  Allow the chicken pieces to marinate for at least 2 hours.

When ready to cook, place the chicken pieces in a large frying pan and add enough water to reconstitute the paste and prevent scorching.  Cover and cook over low heat for 30 minutes.  (You may find that you will have to add more water to prevent scorching.)

After 30 minutes, add the potatoes, cover and continue to cook for an additional 15 minutes, or until the potatoes and chicken are done.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  1              pinch  minced chile, such as jalapeÒo -- (optional)
  1                cup  tender mint leaves -- coarsely torn
  2                     scallions - (to 3) -- trimmed, sliced
                        lengthwise into ribbons, and then cut
                        crosswise into 1" lengths
  5             medium  tomatoes -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  Hot Chile Oil -- (see below)
                        === HOT CHILE OIL ===
     1/2           cup  peanut or vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  dried red chile flakes

Place the garlic and salt in a large mortar and pound together.  Or place them in a large bowl and use the back of a flat spoon to mash them against the side of the bowl.

Add the fresh chile, if using, the mint, and the scallions and continue to pound or mash to soften and blend.

Add the tomatoes and gently pound or mash until borken up a little.  Add the chile oil and toss well.  Serve the salad mounded in a shallow bowl, with the juices poured over.

For Hot Chile Oil:  Heat the oil in a wok or skillet.  As soon as it starts to smoke, toss in the chile flakes, taking care not to splash yourself, and remove from the heat.

Let stand until completely cool, then transfer to a clean dry glass jar and store in a cool place.  If you wish, in several days you can strain out the chiles and store them separately or discard them, leaving you with just a gleaming orange oil.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dry active yeast
  1 1/4           cups  warm water (not over 110 degrees)
  2 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus additional
                        for rolling
     1/4           cup  whole wheat flour or coarse rye flour
  2          teaspoons  Kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  crushed fennel seed
                        Olive oil -- for brushing breads

Combine the yeast and water in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Let it rest until frothy, about 15 minutes.

Using the paddle attachment, incorporate the flours into the yeast mixture.  Beat in the salt and fennel.  Switch to the dough hook and knead for 5 to 7 minutes.

Remove the dough and place it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat.  Cover the dough with plastic and allow it to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down, cover, and let it rise a second time until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Turn the risen dough out onto a work surface and divide it into 8 balls aproximately 3 ounces each.  Place the balls on a floured cookie sheet, cover with a damp towel, and let them rest for 20 minutes.

On a lightly floured work surface roll the balls out, dusting with flour as needed.  Roll into 7-inch disks.

Prepare a hot charcoal or stove top grill.  Lightly brush the disks with olive oil.  Place the disks, oiled-side down on the grill.  The breads will begin to rise almost immediately.  When golden brown on 1 side, flip the breads over, brush again and cook until brown.  Remove from the grill and serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 breads.

VARIATIONS:  Calzones:  Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of a mixture of freshly grated Parmesan and coarsely ground black pepper and fold over.

Pizzas:  After turning, top with a simple tomato sauce made with fresh basil and roasted garlic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTER COOKIES ===
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/3           cup  superfine sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a small bowl, using an electric mixer or by hand using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, beat the butter, sugar, salt and vanilla until well combined.  Do not overmix; you donít want the butter to become fluffy.  Scrape down the bowl using a rubber spatula and beat for a few more seconds.  Sift the flour into the bowl and mix on low speed or by hand just until absorbed.

Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula and mix again for a few seconds.  Turn the dough onto the table, gather it together, and knead gently into a smooth mass.  The dough can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

Form the dough into a round patty and quarter into 4 even pieces.  Roll each piece into a log and cut each log into 10 even pieces.  Roll each piece into a 3/4-inch ball -- about the size of a large marble.  Place the balls about 1 1/2-inches apart on ungreased baking sheets and flatten gently and evenly with the heel of your hand so that theyíre about 1/4-inch thick.  Bake for 22 minutes, or until the cookies just begin to color and the bottoms are golden.  Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

If the ganache was made 2 hours before, it will be soft and moussy.  Whisk it a few times to thicken.  If the ganache was made earlier in the day or the day before, it will be stiff.  Warm it briefly, stirring gently, until it softens a little.  Whisk it with 1 or 2 quick strokes.

Be sure the cookies are completely cool.  Place the ganache in a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.  Holding the bag in a vertical position about 1/2-inch above the cookies, pipe a large dollop of chocolate, leaving a small border of cookie showing around the edge.  Repeat with the remaining cookies.  The chocolate will firm up in about 1 hour.  To hasten the process, refrigerate the cookies for 5 minutes.  Serve at room temperature.

For the Chocolate Ganache:  In a small pot, scald the cream until bubbles appear around the edge and itís just about to boil.  Remove from heat and stir in the chopped chocolate.  Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and dark.  Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool until it thickens, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.  The ganache can be made the day before and left covered, at room temperature, overnight.

This recipe yields 40 cookies.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3            bunches  radishes - (abt 2 doz) -- preferably breakfast
                        radishes
  1                cup  chicken stock, beef broth or water -- or as much as
                        needed to come halfway up sides of radishe
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut the greens off about 1/4 inch above where they join the radishes, leaving a tiny decorative piece of green attached to each radish.  Trim off the root tips.

Put the radishes in a sautÈ pan just large enough to hold them in a single layer and pour over enough broth or water, about 1 cup, to come halfway up the sides of the radishes.  Add the butter to the pan and sprinkle over sugar and salt.

Bring to a simmer over high heat, turn down the heat to medium, and place a sheet of aluminum foil or wax paper loosely over the radishes.  Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the radishes can be poked through with a skewer or paring knife but still offer some resistance. If they are done but there is still liquid in the pan, remove foil or paper and turn the heat up high to quickly evaporate the liquid.

When all the liquid has evaporated and the radishes start to brown on 1 side, toss them, or very gently stir until they are lightly browned on all sides and a thin layer of caramelized sugar has attached to the bottom of the pan.

Pour about 2 tablespoons water into the pan and quickly toss or stir the radishes over high heat to dissolve the sugar caramelized on the bottom of the pan and get it to coat the radishes in an even layer.  When the water has evaporated, grind over some pepper and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

             Grilled Chicken With Hot And Sweet Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  Pepper-Coriander Root Flavor Paste -- (see below)
  2        tablespoons  Thai fish sauce - (to 3)
  3             pounds  chicken breasts or breasts and legs -- chopped 10 to 12 pie
                        === PEPPER-CORIANDER ROOT FLAVOR PASTE ===
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns
  5              large  garlic cloves - (to 6) -- coarsely chopped
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped coriander roots
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  Thai fish sauce
                        === HOT AND SWEET DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  rice or cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2) -- finely minced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried red pepper flakes

Place Pepper-Coriander Root Flavor Paste in a large bowl and stir in the fish sauce.  Place the chicken pieces in the marinade and turn to coat well.  Let stand, covered, at room temperature for about 1 hour or in the refrigerator and for as long as 3 hours.

Heat a grill or preheat the broiler.  If using a grill, place the chicken pieces 4 to 5 inches from the flame, bone-side down, and grill until the bottom side is starting to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Then, turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side and the juices run clear when the meat is pierced.

If using a broiler, put the chicken pieces in a lightly oiled broiling pan, bone-side up, place 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is starting to brown.  Turn the pieces over and broil for another 8 minutes, or until the juices run clear.

Transfer the chicken pieces to a platter and serve with Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce and plenty of sticky rice.

For Pepper-Coriander Root Flavor Paste:  Place the peppercorns in a mortar with the garlic and pound to a paste.  Add the coriander roots and salt and pound to a paste.  This will take 5 to 10 minutes; if you have a small blender or other food grinder that can produce a smooth paste, use it instead.  Stir in the fish sauce.  Will keep in a well-sealed glass jar for up to 4 days.  (Makes 2 to 3 tablespoons paste)

For Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce:  Place the vinegar in a small non-reactive saucepan and heat to a boil.  Add the sugar, stirring until it has completely dissolved, then lower the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, using a mortar and pestle or a bowl and the back of a spoon, pound or mash the garlic and salt to a smooth paste.  Stir in the pepper flakes and blend well.  Remove the vinegar mixture from the heat and stir in the garlic paste.  Let cool to room temperature.  Store sealed in a glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Place Pepper-Coriander Root Flavor Paste in a large bowl and stir in the fish sauce.  Place the chicken pieces in the marinade and turn to coat well.  Let stand, covered, at room temperature for about 1 hour or in the refrigerator and for as long as 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a grill or preheat the broiler.  If using a grill, place the chicken pieces 4 to 5 inches from the flame, bone-side down, and grill until the bottom side is starting to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Then, turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side and the juices run clear when the meat is pierced.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using a broiler, put the chicken pieces in a lightly oiled broiling pan, bone-side up, place 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is starting to brown.  Turn the pieces over and broil for another 8 minutes, or until the juices run clear.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken pieces to a platter and serve with Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce and plenty of sticky rice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Pepper-Coriander Root Flavor Paste:  Place the peppercorns in a mortar with the garlic and pound to a paste.  Add the coriander roots and salt and pound to a paste.  This will take 5 to 10 minutes; if you have a small blender or other food grinder that can produce a smooth paste, use it instead.  Stir in the fish sauce.  Will keep in a well-sealed glass jar for up to 4 days.  (Makes 2 to 3 tablespoons paste)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce:  Place the vinegar in a small non-reactive saucepan and heat to a boil.  Add the sugar, stirring until it has completely dissolved, then lower the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, using a mortar and pestle or a bowl and the back of a spoon, pound or mash the garlic and salt to a smooth paste.  Stir in the pepper flakes and blend well.  Remove the vinegar mixture from the heat and stir in the garlic paste.  Let cool to room temperature.  Store sealed in a glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  milk chocolate -- chopped
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  4          teaspoons  corn syrup
  7             ounces  fresh passion fruit juice
  17            ounces  milk chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  Alize passion fruit liquor
  1              ounce  butter

Temper the 2 pounds of milk chocolate (see the "Tempering Chocolate" recipe which is included in this collection).

Use a ladle to fill the heart shaped molds with chocolate.  When the molds are full, empty the chocolate into a bowl.  The inside of the molds should be evenly coated with chocolate.  Wipe the edge of the mold clean and place the mold upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet.

Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, use a wide pastry scraper to clean the edges of each cavity.  When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold.  A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks.  You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.

Place the cream, corn syrup and fresh passion juice in a pan and scald the mixture.  Pour the hot cream mixture over the chopped chocolate and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender.  Add the Alize and the butter and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender.  Allow the mixture to come to 84 degrees.  Place the mixture in a piping bag and pipe it into the chocolate filled molds.  Let set overnight.

To close the bottoms of each cavity, apply tempered chocolate with an offset spatula.  Scrape clean and allow to set.  When the chocolate has set, invert the mold over a clean dry surface.  It may be necessary to rap the mold against the counter to encourage the chocolates to release from the mold.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Boiled Asparagus -- (see recipe)
     1/4          cups  unsalted butter -- clarified
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

To clarify the butter, heat the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until it melts and froths up.  Simmer it for about 5 minutes, or until the froth subsides and the butter looks clear.  Donít let it burn.  Strain the butter through a fine-mesh strainer, a triple layer of cheesecloth, or a coffee filter.  Let the butter cool for 5 minutes, if the butter is too hot it will curdle the egg yolks.

Combine 3 egg yolks and 3 tablespoons butter in a bowl, and whisk off heat for 1 minute, until frothy.  Place yolks on stovetop over medium-low heat and beat until thick.

Meanwhile drain cooked asparagus, and toss with 1 tablespoon of butter.  Remove yolks from heat, if they have not been removed already and whisk in remaining butter.  Stir in the lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Plate the asparagus and sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  minced onions
     1/4           cup  slivered garlic
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
  1           teaspoon  toasted whole cumin seed
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  5               cups  hot corn or vegetable stock - (to 6)
  2               cups  fresh sweet corn kernels cut from cob
     1/2           cup  diced tomatillos
     1/4           cup  diced red peppers
     1/4           cup  diced yellow peppers
     1/2           cup  sliced green beans, sliced to tiny rounds
     1/2           cup  diced yellow squash
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Dry Jack, Parmesan or Asiag
                        = (or a combination)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CARROT CORN BROTH ===
  4               cups  fresh sweet corn kernels - (4 large ears),
                        to yield 1 cup juice
     3/4         pound  carrots to yield 1 cup juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  softened butter or olive oil
                        Drops of hot sauce -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Rich vegetable stock
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Deep fried basil sprigs

SautÈ the onions and garlic in the olive oil in a deep saucepan over moderate heat until soft but not brown.  Add the rice, stir to coat with oil and sautÈ until rice is opaque, about 3 minutes.  Add the cumin seed and pepper flakes.

Add the wine and cook until all the liquid is absorbed.  Add the hot stock in 1/2 cup portions, stirring after each addition until liquid is almost absorbed.  When the risotto is almost done, and you judge that only a couple more additions are needed, add the corn, tomatillos, peppers, beans and squash.  Continue stirring and adding last of stock until vegetables are tender and rice is creamy but not over-cooked.

Stir in the cheese and cilantro and correct seasoning with salt and pepper.  Scoop into the center of warm soup bowls surrounded by a small ladle of the Carrot-Corn Broth.  Top with basil sprig and serve immediately.

For Carrot-Corn Broth:  In a centrifugal juicer, juice the corn and carrots.  Add juices to a saucepan and warm over moderate heat just below the simmer.  Whisk in butter, drops of hot sauce and salt and pepper to taste.  Thin if desired with a little vegetable stock.  Keep warm.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  For variation you can add poached garlic to the carrots to be juiced; substitute red bell pepper juice for some of the carrot or add an infusion of saffron simmered for a few minutes in a little white wine.  If I feel really decadent, I substitute 2 teaspoons of truffle oil for the butter.

SautÈ the onions and garlic in the olive oil in a deep saucepan over moderate heat until soft but not brown.  Add the rice, stir to coat with oil and sautÈ until rice is opaque, about 3 minutes.  Add the cumin seed and pepper flakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the wine and cook until all the liquid is absorbed.  Add the hot stock in 1/2 cup portions, stirring after each addition until liquid is almost absorbed.  When the risotto is almost done, and you judge that only a couple more additions are needed, add the corn, tomatillos, peppers, beans and squash.  Continue stirring and adding last of stock until vegetables are tender and rice is creamy but not over-cooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the cheese and cilantro and correct seasoning with salt and pepper.  Scoop into the center of warm soup bowls surrounded by a small ladle of the Carrot-Corn Broth.  Top with basil sprig and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Carrot-Corn Broth:  In a centrifugal juicer, juice the corn and carrots.  Add juices to a saucepan and warm over moderate heat just below the simmer.  Whisk in butter, drops of hot sauce and salt and pepper to taste.  Thin if desired with a little vegetable stock.  Keep warm.  (Makes 2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  For variation you can add poached garlic to the carrots to be juiced; substitute red bell pepper juice for some of the carrot or add an infusion of saffron simmered for a few minutes in a little white wine.  If I feel really decadent, I substitute 2 teaspoons of truffle oil for the butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1                cup  yellow southern-style grits, uncooked
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  grated cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  cooked diced hickory-smoked bacon
  1         tablespoon  pureed chipotle chiles in Adobo sauce
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  double espresso
  2        tablespoons  molasses
     3/4           cup  glace de viande
  4                     center-cut beef tenderloin fillets -- (8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  1                cup  white onion -- julienned
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  6               cups  cleaned spinach leaves
  2        tablespoons  butter

To make the grits bring the chicken broth to a boil and add the grits.  Decrease the heat and simmer for 20 minutes over low heat, stirring frequently.  Stir in the milk, grated cheddar cheese, cooked bacon and pureed chipotle chile.  Season to taste and set aside in a warm place.

To prepare the shellac, add the double espresso and the molasses to the glace de viande.  Stir the ingredients together and set the shellac aside in a warm place.

Season the beef fillets with salt and pepper.  Then sear them in hot corn oil in a heavy skillet for 3 minutes over moderately-high heat.  Turn the fillets over and sear for 2 more minutes, then place the skillet with the fillets in a 400 degree oven for 7 minutes.  Remove from the oven, brush with half the shellac and allow to cool to room temperature.

In a hot, heavy skillet saute the white onion, garlic and spinach leaves in the butter until the spinach is just wilted, then season to taste with salt and pepper.

For each serving, spoon a mound of the grits onto the center of a plate and top with the sautÈed spinach.  Cut each beef fillet from the top to bottom at an angle.  Place half a fillet, with the cut side facing the front of the plate on the spinach leaves and grits.  Place the other half of the fillet on the plate so that itís facing the front of the plate, leaning against the grits and the other half of the fillet.  Drizzle the shellac around the perimeter of the plate and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Pecan Praline Lace Cookies, Cups, And Coronets

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pecans -- plus
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- softened
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a small bowl, combine the pecans and flour.  In a small saucepan, combine the butter, sugar, and corn syrup.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir the dry ingredients into a pan.  Transfer the batter to a bowl and stir occasionally until it thickens into a dough and is cool enough to handle, about 25 minutes.

With moistened hands, roll the dough into various size balls, depending on whether youíre making cookies, cups or coronets (see below).  Place on ungreased baking sheets, 3 to 7 inches apart, depending on size -- they spread quite a bit.  Bake about 12 minutes, or until the active bubbling subsides.

Place the baking sheet on rack and let cool until the cookies are firm enough to lift with a flexible metal spatula but are still malleable, 3 to 5 minutes.  Working quickly, mold each into shape and set on a wire rack to cool completely.  If the cookies get too cool and brittle to mold, put the try back in the oven for a minute to soften.

To make 9 dessert bowls:  With moistened hands, mold each ball using a rounded tablespoon of dough.  Place only 2 balls on the ungreased baking sheet.  Have 2 small soup bowls measuring 4 1/2 to 5 inches across the top ready by the oven.  Follow the baking instruction above.

When set but still malleable, lift the cookies, one at a time, and place each in a bowl, nutty, bumpy-side up.  Gently press the bottom to flatten.  The sides will ruffle prettily.  Wipe the excess butter off the baking sheet and continue with the remaining dough.  If you have more than 1 baking sheet, stagger the baking so that you can mold 1 tray while the other is in the oven.

Fill with butterscotch ice cream, pumpkin mousse, bananas and cream, or anything that strikes your fancy and goes well with pecans.

To make 9 ice cream cones:  Follow the baking instructions above for dessert bowls, but when you lift a cookie off the baking sheet, roll it into a cone with the nutty, bumpy side facing out, and hold it for a few seconds to set.  Lay it on the cooling rack, seam-side down, and place a cylindrical object, such as a pill bottle, in the opening to set until you roll the next cookie.

Fill with scoops of any flavor ice cream or sorbet that complements pecans.

To make 18 coronets:  With moistened hands, mold rounded teaspoons of the dough into balls.  Place about 9 balls on an ungreased baking sheet.  Follow the baking instructions for ice-cream cones; youíre making a smaller version of the same.  Repeat with a second tray.

Fill with mousse, ice cream, or berries and cream.  Place a little dab of cream on the plate to anchor the coronets, and place 1 or 2 coronets on each plate with fruit sauce or hot fudge spilling out of the opening.

To make 24 cookies:  With moistened hands, mold level teaspoons of dough into balls.  Place about 12 balls on an ungreased baking sheet.  Follow the instructions above.  When the cookies are set but still flexible, transfer to a cooling rack.  Repeat with a second tray.

To make 24 cigarettes:  Follow the baking instructions for cookies, but when you lift a cookie off the baking sheet, roll it around a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon.  Lay it on the cooling rack, seam-side down.  If the cookies get too brittle to mold, put the baking sheet back in the oven for a minute to soften them.

To dip the ends in melted chocolate, immerse 1 end of a cookie, then the other, shake off the excess chocolate, and dip the end into a small bowl of grated chocolate.  Lay it on a sheet pan lined with parchment or waxed paper.  When all the cookies are dipped, place the tray in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes, just until the chocolate sets.

This recipe yield varies according to shape.

To make 9 ice cream cones:  Follow the baking instructions above for dessert bowls, but when you lift a cookie off the baking sheet, roll it into a cone with the nutty, bumpy side facing out, and hold it for a few seconds to set.  Lay it on the cooling rack, seam-side down, and place a cylindrical object, such as a pill bottle, in the opening to set until you roll the next cookie.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill with scoops of any flavor ice cream or sorbet that complements pecans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make 18 coronets:  With moistened hands, mold rounded teaspoons of the dough into balls.  Place about 9 balls on an ungreased baking sheet.  Follow the baking instructions for ice-cream cones; youíre making a smaller version of the same.  Repeat with a second tray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill with mousse, ice cream, or berries and cream.  Place a little dab of cream on the plate to anchor the coronets, and place 1 or 2 coronets on each plate with fruit sauce or hot fudge spilling out of the opening.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make 24 cookies:  With moistened hands, mold level teaspoons of dough into balls.  Place about 12 balls on an ungreased baking sheet.  Follow the instructions above.  When the cookies are set but still flexible, transfer to a cooling rack.  Repeat with a second tray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make 24 cigarettes:  Follow the baking instructions for cookies, but when you lift a cookie off the baking sheet, roll it around a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon.  Lay it on the cooling rack, seam-side down.  If the cookies get too brittle to mold, put the baking sheet back in the oven for a minute to soften them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To dip the ends in melted chocolate, immerse 1 end of a cookie, then the other, shake off the excess chocolate, and dip the end into a small bowl of grated chocolate.  Lay it on a sheet pan lined with parchment or waxed paper.  When all the cookies are dipped, place the tray in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes, just until the chocolate sets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PINEAPPLE ICE ===
  1                     pineapple - (abt 3 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar - (to 1/3)
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice - (to 1/3)
                        === MERINGUE ===
  3                     egg whites -- room temperature
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar -- ground to a powder
                        in the food processor or blender

To make the pineapple ice:  Halve the pineapple lengthwise.  With a grapefruit or other small sharp knife cut around the inside edges and remove the pulp, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shells.  Pat the shells dry and freeze them, covered with plastic wrap.

Core the pineapple pulp and cut it into 1-inch pieces.  In the food processor or in a blender puree the pulp until smooth, blend in the granulated sugar and lemon juice to taste, and transfer the mixture to the ice-cube trays.  Freeze the ice in the freezing compartment of the refrigerator until frozen.

Transfer the cubes to the food processor, and blend them until the ice is light and fluffy.  Pack the ice into the pineapple shells, mounding it slightly, and freeze the shells, covered with plastic wrap, in the freezing compartment of the refrigerator until the ice is frozen.

Preheat the broiler.

In a bowl with the mixer beat the whites with the salt until foamy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks.  Add the pulverized granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat the meringue until it holds stiff peaks.

Transfer the meringue to the pastry bag (fitted with a small star tip) and pipe it decoratively over the ice, covering the ice completely.  Sift the confectionersí sugar over the meringue, arrange the shells on a baking sheet, and put them under the broiler about 6 inches from the heat for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the meringue is browned lightly.  Serve the desserts immediately.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  egg whites -- room temperature
  1              pound  confectionersí sugar - (1 box)

For the Royal Icing Cookie Paint:  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a bowl using a handheld mixer, begin to beat the egg whites and sugar on low speed.  Be sure the bowl and beaters are free of any fat and that there is no egg yolk in the whites.  After 30 seconds or so, scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and gradually increase the speed of the mixer to medium.  Beat until the mixture thickens and stiffens, about 3 minutes.

Keep Royal Icing in an airtight container.  To prevent a crust from forming while using the icing, keep the container covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap.  Royal Icing will keep refrigerated for up to 2 days.  Before reusing, lightly beat with a whisk or fork.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups icing to cover about 4 to 6 dozen 3-inch cookies.

                        === DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cold unsalted butter
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 5)
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  Italian prune plums
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Make dough:  Cut butter into bits and in a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food processor blend or pulse together with, flour, sugar, and salt until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water and toss or pulse until incorporated.  Add enough remaining ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork or pulsing to incorporate, to form a dough.

Gather dough into a ball.  On a work surface smear dough with heel of hand in 3 or 4 forward motions to make dough easier to work with.  Form dough into a ball and flatten into a disk.  Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Make filling:  Halve and pit plums.  Cut plums into 3/4-inch-thick wedges and in a bowl toss with sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice.

On a lightly floured surface with floured rolling pin roll out dough into an 11-inch round (about 1/8-inch thick).  Transfer dough to a 9-inch (1-quart) glass pie plate.  (Do not trim overhang.)  Spoon filling into shell and fold edge of dough over filling, leaving center uncovered.

Bake pie in middle of oven 35 minutes.  Brush crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake pie 10 minutes more, or until filling is bubbling and crust is golden.  Cool pie on a rack.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

  12                    Valencia oranges
  2        tablespoons  orange-flower water
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar

Peel the oranges, slice them into thin circles, and remove all the seeds with the tip of a paring knife.  Arrange the orange slices on a large platter or in a shallow glass bowl.  Sprinkle the orange flower water over the slices.  Mix the cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkle it over the oranges.

The salad is ready to serve, though I find it tastier if it is covered with plastic wrap and chilled for 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  4              large  onions -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  minced fresh habanero chile -- or to taste
  5        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1                     frying chicken - (2 1/2 to 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut serving pieces
  1                     habanero chile -- pricked with fork
     1/2           cup  pimento-stuffed olives
  4                     carrots -- scraped, sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  Dijon-style mustard
     1/2           cup  water
                        === PLAIN WHITE RICE ===
  3 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  uncooked rice
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  butter

In a large non-reactive bowl, prepare marinade by mixing the lemon juice, onions, salt, pepper, minced chile, and 4 tablespoons of the peanut oil.  Place the chicken pieces in the marinade, making sure that they are all well covered.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the chicken to marinate for at least 3 hours in the refrigerator.

Preheat the broiler.  Remove the chicken pieces, reserving the marinade and onions, and place the chicken in a shallow pan.  Broil the chicken until it is lightly browned on both sides.  Remove the onions from the marinade.

Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a flameproof 5-quart casserole or Dutch oven and cook the onions slowly until tender and translucent.  Add the reserved marinade.  When the liquid is thoroughly heated, add the chicken pieces, pricked chile, olives, carrots, mustard, and water.

When the dish has reached the desired degree of hotness, remove the chile and reserve (it can be served separately to the chile heads).  Stir to mix well, then bring the yassa slowly to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  Serve over Plain White Rice.

For the Plain White Rice:  Bring the water to a boil in medium saucepan.  Stir in the remaining ingredients, cover, and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.  Remove the rice from the heat and allow it to stand for 5 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed.  Fluff with a fork and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     chicken breasts
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika

     1/2           cup  chicken stock

Clean chicken breasts and dry well.  In a shallow baking dish, combine the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and pepper.  Dredge chicken breasts in flour mixture to coat.  Shake off excess.

Pour excess oil from pan, leaving a thin layer.  Add onions and garlic, saute, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes.

In a bowl combine sour cream, chicken stock and green onions and mix well.  Transfer chicken back to skillet, pour sour cream mixture over it.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until done, about 10 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  1 2/3           cups  sugar
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        === ROYAL ICING COOKIE PAINT ===
  3              large  egg whites -- room temperature
  1              pound  confectionersí sugar - (1 box)

In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Whisk to evenly combine.

In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, stopping the mixer once or twice to scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula.

Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each until thoroughly incorporated.  Add the vanilla.  Scrape the bowl again and mix for a few more seconds.  On low speed, add 1/2 the dry ingredients.  Beat until combined.  Add the remaining dry ingredients and beat just until the flour is completely absorbed into the dough.

Turn the dough onto the table, gather it together, and knead gently into a smooth mass.  Form it into a log and divide into 3 even parts.  Flatten each section into a patty about 1/2-inch thick and cover each with plastic wrap.  Chill until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.  The dough may also be frozen for up to 1 month.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Let the dough sit at room temperature, still covered, for about 20 minutes to soften slightly.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to slightly more than 1/8-inch thick.

Cut out shapes with cookie cutters, as close together as possible, and use a palate knife or metal spatula to transfer to ungreased baking sheets, placing them about 1-inch apart.  Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.  Press the scraps together, roll them out, and cut, always brushing off any excess flour, until all used up.

Bake cookies for about 17 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden.  Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

For the Royal Icing Cookie Paint:  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a bowl using a handheld mixer, begin to beat the egg whites and sugar on low speed.  Be sure the bowl and beaters are free of any fat and that there is no egg yolk in the whites.  After 30 seconds or so, scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and gradually increase the speed of the mixer to medium.  Beat until the mixture thickens and stiffens, about 3 minutes.

Keep Royal Icing in an airtight container.  To prevent a crust from forming while using the icing, keep the container covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap.  Royal Icing will keep refrigerated for up to 2 days.  Before reusing, lightly beat with a whisk or fork.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups icing)

This recipe yields 5 to 6 dozen 3-inch cookies

  2              small  boiling potatoes - (abt 1/2 lb)
  3               cups  chicken broth
  3               cups  boiling water -- plus additional
                        to thin soup
  1                cup  shelled fresh peas - (abt 1 lb in pods)
                        = (or thawed frozen peas)

                        Cornmeal Fried Oysters -- (see recipe)

In a large mixing bowl, combine the turkey cubes, shallots, garlic, basil, parsley, thyme, and 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally, at least 6 hours or overnight.

Pour 1/4 cup of the oil into a large saucepan.  Heat the oil over high heat to 350 degrees.  Add the leek and cook for 1 minute, until golden brown, being careful no to let the hot oil splatter.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the leek from the oil and place on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.  Reserve.

Remove the turkey cubes from the marinade, discarding the marinade.  Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and place in a medium mixing bowl.  Sprinkle the flour over the turkey cubes and toss to coat thoroughly.

In a large skillet, cook the turkey in 2 tablespoons of the oil over high heat for 5 minutes, until brown.  Add the onions, celery, and carrots, and sautÈ for 5 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are crisp tender.

Add the sherry to deglaze the pan, loosening any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, until the liquid is reduced by 1/2, about 30 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add the bay leaf.  Reduce the heat and simmer, until liquid is reduced by 1/2.  Add the demi-glace and bring to a boil over high heat.  Remove from the heat.

In another large skillet, sautÈ the red cabbage, zucchini, and yellow squash in the butter and remaining oil over medium heat for 5 minutes, until the vegetables are soft.  Add the tomato and sautÈ for 2 minutes more, until the tomato is soft.  Gently stir the vegetable mixture into the turkey mixture.

Serve the stew over Herbed Spaetzle or egg noodles.  Garnish with Cornmeal Fried Oysters and the reserved fried leeks.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Milk chocolate

Tempering is important because it determines the final gloss, hardness, and contraction of the chocolate.  Those factors are evidence that the cocoa butter in the chocolate has been correctly crystallized.  Chocolate is purchased in its tempered form.  It snaps when you break it, usually has a nice shine to it and it is hard.  In order to use it, you need to melt it.  When you melt chocolate, the molecules of fat separate and you lose the temper (crystallization).  If you want to use the chocolate for molding or coating, it needs to be tempered.  Tempering chocolate means putting the molecules of fat back together.  There are a variety of ways to do it.

One of the easiest ways to temper it is to place the chocolate in a glass bowl and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted.  Be very careful not to overheat it.  Keep an eye on it; the chocolate will not look like it has melted because it retains its shape.  The chocolate should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip.  You may still see lumps in it but, donít worry; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them.  You can also use an immersion blender to break up the lumps and start the recrystallization process.  Usually, the chocolate begins to set (recrystallize) along the side of the bowl.  As it begins to crystallize, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin the recrystallization process.  I like to use a glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered a long time.

Here is another easy way to temper chocolate.  In this method, tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.  The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount.  I use an immersion blender to mix the 2 together.

The classic way to temper chocolate is call tabliering.  Chocolate is melted over a hot water bath to a temperature between 88 and 90 degrees.  White and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2 degrees less, depending on the amount of milk fat they contain.  2/3 of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table or marble surface.  The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81 degrees.  At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.  This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature.  If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached.  This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room and makes a big mess.

Here is a tip:  Temper more chocolate than you need.  A larger quantity will hold its temper longer than a smaller quantity (just like a large cup of coffee will stay hot longer than a small cup of espresso).  You can always reuse the extra chocolate.  Most people have trouble tempering because they use too small of an amount.  Donít forget to use a glass bowl.

A simple method of checking tempering is by applying a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.  If the chocolate has been correctly tempered it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes.

Remember, just like everything else in life, practice makes perfect.  If your chocolate does not temper the first time, you can still eat it!  Now that is an incentive!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  whole-grain pastry flour
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2          teaspoons  baking soda

Set out the ingredients of your choice on one or more plates or shallow bowls to accompany any meal.

For Carrot and Daikon Pickled Salad:  Cut the tip off each carrot on a long diagonal.  Use a mandoline or other vegetable slicer or a coarse grater to slice the carrots into strips, or use a knife to cut into matchsticks.  You should have approximately 2 cups.  Place the carrots in a large strainer and set aside.

Use the same method to make daikon strips.  You should have approximately 2 cups.  Add to the carrots in the strainer and mix well with your hands.  Sprinkle on the salt and toss to mix.  Place over a bowl or in the sink and let stand for 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a nonreactive saucepan, combine the water, vinegar, and sugar and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature.  Donít cook the vegetables, bathe them.

Rinse the vegetables briefly with cold water, then squeeze dry and transfer to a medium bowl.  Pour over the vinegar mixture and stir gently with a wooden spoon to ensure all the vegetables are well moistened.  Let stand for 1 hour before serving.

To serve, lift the salad out of the vinegar bath and mound attractively on a plate.  (Makes 2 to 3 cups)

For Pickled Bean Sprout Salad:  Rinse the bean sprouts well in cold water, drain, and place in a large bowl.  Add scallions and set aside.

Place the remaining ingredients in a nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.

Pour the vinegar mixture over the sprouts and scallions and stir gently to immerse all the vegetables.  Let stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.

Drain the bean sprouts and serve mounded on several plates.  (Makes 6 to 8 cups)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic heads
  1 1/2           cups  dried white beans, such as
                        Great Northern or navy
     3/4           cup  chicken broth
                        Salt -- to taste

     1/2           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened

Separate garlic heads into cloves (do not peel).  Pick over beans and in a 4-quart kettle combine with garlic and enough cold water to cover beans by 2 inches.  Gently simmer bean mixture, adding more water as necessary to keep beans covered, until beans are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

In a bowl with your fingertips blend together bread crumbs and butter.  Sprinkle crumb mixture evenly over bean mixture and bake in middle of oven until golden and bubbly, about 20 minutes

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Stocks


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             pounds  meat and bones of chicken -- chopped 2" to 3" pie
                        = (backs, necks, wings are best)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2                     carrots -- scraped
  2                     onions -- peeled
  2                     celery stalks
  2                     leeks -- washed
                        === BOUQUET GARNI ===
                        Into a cheesecloth tie:
  4                     thyme stems
  1                     bay leaf
  6                     parsley sprigs
  2                     unpeeled garlic cloves
  5                     peppercorns

Place meat and bones into large stockpot and add cold water to cover them by 2 inches, Bring to a simmer at medium heat.  As the liquid starts to simmer, scum will rise.  Remove it with a ladle for about 20 minutes until it stops to accumulate.

Add the vegetables and the bouquet garni and add more water if necessary -- water should cover all ingredients by 1 inch.  When liquid is simmering again, skim as necessary.  Keep at a simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.  Skim fat and scum occasionally.  Boiling water should be added if the liquid evaporates below the level of all ingredients.

Never allow the liquid to boil to avoid fat and scum incorporating themselves into the liquid and making it cloudy.  Cooking may be stopped at any time and continued later.  Never cover the pot totally until contents have completely cooled -- otherwise the stock will turn sour.

After 4 to 5 hours of cooking, strain the stock out of the stockpot into a bowl.  Press on the vegetables to squeeze out all the liquid.  Discard the vegetables.  Let stock settle for 5 minutes.  Remove fat from its surface with a ladle, then draw paper towels over the surface of the stock to blot up last traces of fat.  Or put the stock into the refrigerator, uncovered, until fat on top has hardened and can be scraped off.

Taste the degreased stock for taste.  Boil it down to evaporate some of its water content and to concentrate its strength.  Chill in ice-bath.  Cover and refrigerate it, or bottle and freeze it.  Stock kept in the refrigerator must be brought to the boil every 3 or 4 days to keep it from spoiling.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bok choy or Shanghai bok choy -- (5 to 8 heads)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  peanut or vegetable oil
  2                     Thai dried red chiles
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/2                cup mild vegetable broth or water
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water

Place a large pot of water on to boil.  Meanwhile, cut the bok choy lengthwise into thirds or quarters and place in a sink full of cold water to soak for several minutes.  Wash thoroughly to get any dirt out of the base of the stalks.

When the water is boiling, add about 1 tablespoon salt, bring back to the boil, and add the bok choy.  Stir with a long-handled wooden spoon to make sure all the greens are immersed.  Bring back to a boil, boil for under a minute, drain, and set aside.

Heat a large wok over high heat.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the wok.  Toss in the chiles and ginger.  Stir briefly, then add the greens and stir-fry for 30 seconds, pressing them against the sides of the wok to sear them a little.  Add the broth and let it boil for about 30 seconds.

Stir the cornstarch paste well, then add it together with 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Stir-fry for another 15 to 30 seconds, turn out onto a small platter, and serve.  (Warn your guests that the chiles are not for eating, just for flavor.)

This recipe yields 4 servings as one of several dishes in a meal.
