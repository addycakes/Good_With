        Ajoblanco - {Spanish-Central Andalusian Cold Almond Soup}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  crusty white bread -- crusts cut off
                        Water -- to soak the bread
     1/4         pound  raw (not toasted) peeled almonds
  2                     garlic cloves
  7               cups  cold water
  1                cup  olive oil
                        Vinegar - (red wine or
                        sherry vinegar preferred)
                        Garnish -- (see below)

Garnish:  In M·laga it is customary to serve Ajoblanco with peeled and seeded grapes, or apple slices.  Melon, small shrimps or sliced, roasted almonds also go very well with this soup. 
Soak the bread thoroughly in water.  To peel the almonds, dip them for a few seconds in openly boiling water then pop the peels off with a squeeze. 
With a powerful blender, grind the almonds, together with the garlic and a little salt, as fine as you can (the finer they are ground, the creamier the result will be).  Then add the soaked bread and blend until you get a white homogeneous paste.  Still blending, add the oil in a thread, as you would in a mayonnaise, and then the vinegar (for the quantity, follow your taste, but just a spritz is sufficient -- otherwise you will mask the taste) and the water.  Adding the oil and water must be done slowly; you want a smooth emulsion, not curd! 
That's it.  Serve it very to 6 to 8 people -- and with the garnish of your choice; sliced and seeded grapes, or apple slices, or melon, or small shrimps or even sliced, roasted almonds. 
Comments:  Ajoblanco, according to recipe contributor JosÈ Luis Vivas, is a Weight Watcher's worst nightmare.  Thanks to the high energy contents of the almonds and bread, it is a caloric bomb.  In fact, he says, these soups were usually consumed by country laborers in Andalusia during the harvest months as a mid-morning snack.  They would have breakfast very early (5:00 AM) and about 11:00 they stopped to prepare the soup (or have someone bring it from the house), take it and brace themselves for temperatures above 95∞ from noon onwards.  Logically, they stopped about 14:00 and had some light lunch... and a siesta, unless they were picking cotton and a storm was on the way. 
The soup is wonderful -- refreshing and very "drinkable" in texture, with unexpected richness, depth of flavor, and true savoriness.  Hard to believe it's so bad for you.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried common white beans
  1        small piece  salty ham, ham bone, or bacon
  4               cups  boiling water
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  white peppercorns
  3                     whole cloves
  1                     carrot -- diced
  3                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     potato -- grated

Soak the beans overnight, then discard water.  Put beans, ham/bacon, boiling water, bay leaf, pepper, and cloves in a pot and cook slowly until the beans are soft, about 2 to 3 hours.  Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and grated potato and cook 30 more minutes. 
Remove the meat and shred.  Put the soup through a food mill or processor.  Thin, if you like, with water or milk.  Correct seasoning.  Ladle into bowls and top with croutons and parsley. 
Serve hot to 2 to 3 people. 
Comments:  It's a main course, often with internal consequences -- which, presumably, is one of the reasons that it's as American as can be. 
SoupTale:  Barometer Soup...by Mark Twain, A Tramp Abroad  "I know, by my scientific reading, that either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled, to make them accurate; I did not know which it was, so I boiled both.  There was still no result. 
...I hunted up another barometer; it was new and perfect.  I boiled it half an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making.  The result was unexpected: the instrument was not affected at all, but there was such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook, who was a most conscientious person, changed its name in the bill of fare.  This dish was so greatly liked by all, that I ordered the cook to have barometer soup every day."

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  tomatoes - (32 oz)
                        (or 8 large fresh tomatoes, peeled)
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, chopped
  1                     green pepper -- cored, chopped
  1                     garlic clove
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  vinegar - (to 4 tbspns) -- see * Note

* Note:  Or whatever you're in the mood for, but use white with fresh tomatoes so you don't overpower their fresh taste. 
Use the blender; first chop up the garlic, then add the cucumbers and green peppers, adding tomato juice as needed to liquify.  Finally add the tomatoes and the rest of the juice.  If you want elegance, press through a sieve.  If you're going for heartiness, just leave it the way it is.  Mix in the olive oil, vinegar, and salt.  Refrigerate. 
When ready to serve, pour into bowls and garnish with salad vegetables as you see fit:  minced or notched and sliced cucumber; thin green pepper slices; chopped green onions; and/or croutons. 
Serve cold as a first course to 4 people. 
Comments:  A Spanish "pureed salad" that even the fussiest eaters like.  I learned it as a "Malagan" gazpacho, but discovered from Seville native JosÈ Luis Vivas that it's much closer to a traditional Andalusian.  AND it is ridiculously easy and fast to make. 
Soup Tale:  In the 1970s Alexis Bespaloff, wine expert, shed light on the slow start this tangy Spanish marvel had in the United States. "Some years ago I dined in an elaborately decorated and expensive restaurant in Atlanta.  I was so surprised to see gazpacho on the menu that I ordered it, and this cold soup was beautifully served in a silver tureen, accompanied by minced onions and croutons.  As I began to eat the soup, I had the most peculiar impression about its taste, which was later confirmed by a friendly waiter: I was sitting a long way from home, eating canned tomato juice out of a bowl with a spoon."

I was so surprised to see gazpacho on the menu that I ordered it, and this cold soup was beautifully served in a silver tureen, accompanied by minced onions and croutons.  As I began to eat the soup, I had the most peculiar impression about its taste, which was later confirmed by a friendly waiter: I was sitting a long way from home, eating canned tomato juice out of a bowl with a spoon.&quot;

       Andalusian Onion And Almond Soup - {Cebollada Con Almendras}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  onions -- sliced thin
  6               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     parsley sprigs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  blanched almonds - (abt 40)
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
                        === GARNISH ===
  6             slices  French bread, 1/4" thick -- lightly toasted
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Sliced toasted almonds

* Note:  The orginal recipe actually called for a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar for garnish, but that's just a quirk of those spice-mad Renaissance rascals! 
Heat the oil in a large pot, then saute the onion slices until they are wilted, not brown.  Add the stock, wine, bay leaf, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. 
Take the almonds and grind them as finely as possible in a blender -- then slowly add 1/2 cup of the hot soup broth, blending it to a milky liquid.  Strain the broth back into the soup pot.  (If big chunks of almond are left, you can repeat the blending process -- but be careful not to put any chunks of almond in the soup.  Stir in cumin.  Cover again and simmer 30 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, remove the parsley and bay leaf.  Ladle the soup into individual bowls and top each with a slice of toast sprinkled with cheese.  Run under a broiler for a minute until the bread and cheese are golden.  Serve immediately, sprinkled with the toasted almonds. 
Serve hot as a first course to 6 people. 
Comments:  This delectable and delicate soup dates back to a 16th century cookbook, the first in the Spanish language, written by Ruperto de Nola, chef to King Ferdinando.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2                     onions -- chopped

  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- cut and drained,
                        with juice reserved
     1/2           cup  corn (preferably fresh)
  1         tablespoon  sliced basil in thin ribbons, (chiffonade)
  4               cups  beef or vegetable stock
  1                     avocado -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  lime juice

                        Basil shreds

In a medium saucepan, saute garlic, onions, jalapeÒo pepper, and celery in the olive oil for about 5 minutes.  Add tomato pieces, chili powder, and cumin, and cook down over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add corn, basil, reserved tomato juice, and stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. 
When ready to serve, remove soup from heat and stir in the lime juice and avocado.  Break several nacho chips into each bowl, ladle in the soup, then top each with a spoonful of sour cream.  Toss on a few basil shreds and stick a nacho chip on top.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 6 people as complete lunch -- or as a substantial first course. 
Comments:  A wonderfully tasty, quick, low calorie, and filling soup -- fit for Montezuma after a hard day at the sacrificial altar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  eggplant
     1/4           cup  tahini - (ground raw sesame seeds
                        found in most supermarkets)
  2                     garlic cloves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  6               cups  vegetable or beef stock
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     egg
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped parsley

Heat the eggplant in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool, then -- holding it by the stem -- carefully peel the skin away and remove the stem.  Puree with the tahini, garlic, and salt.  Stir into the heated stock, then bring to a simmer.  Partially cover, then simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove from heat and press through a sieve, discarding solids. 
When ready to serve, heat the soup, then beat the egg with the lemon juice and stir through the simmering soup to form long egg strands.  Simmer for another minute, then ladle into bowls and top with handfuls of fresh chopped parsley.  Top with toasted strips of pita bread.  Serve with warm triangles of pita bread on the side. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Baba Ghannouj translates literally to "spoiled old daddy. " Why?  Because, the story goes, the woman who created it pureed the eggplant just to ease the eating and digestion of her old and toothless father.  A nice story -- and a substantial and aromatic start to a Mideast meal; imagine yourself in a Turkish souq.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped fine
  1                     leek, all white and some green -- chopped fine
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2             pounds  red beets -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  sherry wine vinegar
  1                cup  dry sherry
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Cream
                        Fresh parsley sprigs

In a Dutch oven, saute the onion, leeks, and garlic in the butter over a low heat, until they are very soft and golden -- as much as 25 minutes.  Stir in the chopped beets and saute for about 5 minutes.  Add the vinegar, stock, and sugar.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes.  Uncover and cook for another 20 minutes, until the beets are very tender. 
Puree the mixture -- solids first, then liquid.  Return the soup to the Dutch oven, add sherry, cream, salt, and pepper.  When you're ready to serve it hot, reheat and ladle into bowls, then drip in some cream into each portion and swirl gently with a knife for a dramatic effect.  Top each with a tiny parsley sprig. 
This soup can be served cold to great acclaim -- plus with a bit a of kick from the sherry -- but remember to season more highly with salt if you do. 
Comments:  A rich and unusual first course; can be served hot or cold to 4 people; very Spanish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fish -- cut bite-size
                        (any combination of eel, haddock, red
                        snapper, bass, monkfish, etc.)
  3             pounds  lobster -- broken into pieces
  3              dozen  mussels -- washed, and
                        beards removed
  3                     leeks -- slivered
  2                     onions -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1                     bouquet garni -- consisting of
                        Thyme -- plus
                        Bay leaf -- plus
                        Parsley -- and
                        Rosemary -- tied in cheesecloth
  1                     meaty pinch saffron -- heated, crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Croutons fried in garlic-flavored oil

Heat the oil in a Dutch oven and add leeks, onions, garlic, and tomatoes -- cooking over a low heat for at least 15 minutes.  Add the bouquet garni and the heavy pieces of fish -- cook gently for about 5 minutes. 
Add the remaining fish, lobster, and saffron and cover with water (or fish stock).  Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and bring to a boil.  Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, then add the mussels and cook until they open their shells. 
When ready to serve, strain the ingredients into a serving dish then pour the hot broth over top.  Serve the croutons separately. 
Comments:  This superb French institution makes an unconscionably good meal -- this particular recipe for 8 people. 
Compare Thackeray's unabashed rhapsodic ballad with Norman Douglas's corner-of-the-mouth remark: 
The Ballad of Bouillabaisse 
A street there is in Paris famous, 
For which no rhyme our language yields,
Rue Neuve des Petit Champs its name is -
The New Street of the Little Fields.
And here's an inn, not rich and splendid
But still in comfortable ease;
the which I oft in youth attended,
To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse.  
This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is -
A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes,
That Greenwich never could outdo:
Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron,
Soles, onion, garlic, roach, and dace:
All these you eat at Terre's tavern
in that one dish of Bouillabaisse.  
Indeed a rich a savory stew 'tis;
And true philosophers, methinks,
Who love all sorts of natural beauties,
Should love good victuals and good drinks.
And Cordelier or Benedictine
Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace,
Nor find a fast day too afflicting,
Which served him up a Bouillabaisse.  
Now here's Norman Douglas, author of the febrile South Wind:  "Bouillabaisse is only good because cooked by the French, who, if they cared to try, could produce an excellent and nutritious substitute out of cigar stumps and empty match boxes."

              Breton Billi Bi - {Soupe De Moules Au Safran}

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        bottle  dry white white
                        (preferably Muscadet, the only wine
                        of Brittany, but dry vermouth is fine)
  1                     bouquet garni -- consisting of
                        Thyme -- plus
                        Parsley -- plus
  1                     Bay leaf -- tied together or
                        wrapped in foil then pierced with a fork
  1                cup  water
  2             pounds  mussels (in the shell)
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     leeks, white only -- cut into slivers
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and cut
                        into very fine slivers (like the leeks)
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  2                     egg yolks -- beaten
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced tarragon -- for garnish

Mix the wine, bouquet garni, and water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil.  After you've scrubbed and debearded the mussels, as needed, drop them into the saucepan, cover, and shake them over high heat until they open -- just a few minutes. 
Drain them through a sieve lined with coffee filters, catching the broth underneath. 
Ladle some of the broth into a bowl with the saffron in it -- and let sit to make a strong infusion. 
Shell the mussels. 
Cut the leeks and carrots into fine slivers (so that they're easy to eat with a soupspoon). 
Melt the butter in a large saucepan, then add the slivers and cook covered on medium low heat, letting them sweat until tender.  Add the broth and bring to a boil.  Stir in the saffron infusion, the cream, the Tabasco sauce, and season to taste.  Let bubble for some 5 minutes, then reduce heat. 
Mix a ladleful with the beaten egg yolks, to make a liaison, then stir back into the pot and let thicken over a low heat for several minutes. 
When the soup has thickened, stir in the mussels and let warm in the simmering liquid for a few minutes.  Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle each with finely minced tarragon. 
Serve hot to 4 as a first course to an elegant meal. 
Comments:  Don't be afraid of picking up those plastic bags full of mussels at the grocery -- the mussels are clean, often debearded, and whip up into a smashing soup in no time.  This Breton soup, for example, is pretty easy and quick for being such a showstopping beauty.  And it's no wonder: the north coast of Brittany, from which this soup came, is so thick with these shellfish, you can just run down to beach and pick them fresh from the rocks.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     nut of butter
  1                big  onion -- peeled, and
                        sliced very thinly
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        sliced very thinly
  1              quart  milk
                        Salt (preferably sel de mer
                        with its tang of the sea)
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Stale (or toasted) bread -- sliced paper thin

In a good-sized frying pan, melt the butter and brown it -- either on a wood fire or on the stove.  Add the sliced onions and cook them til browned.  Add the garlic and stir until all is well browned. 
Pour in the milk, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook, simmering, to a turn -- about 5 to 10 minutes.  Pour over very thin slices of bread and serve -- either to the newlyweds or to your own family. 
Serve hot to 2 after a wedding -- or to 4 for a snack or warming lunch.  It's a good, filling, and spicy meal. 
Comments:  A great story from Pierre-Jakez Helias in The Horse of Pride: Life in a Breton Village. 
"Custom still required that the newlyweds not be left to themselves until the evening of the third day.  The first night was dedicated to the Virgin; the second, to Saint Joseph.  And then came the "milk soup" ceremony, which was both symbolic and rather spicy.  The recipe for that soup varied from one region to another and depended on the young people's imaginations, but it always included a string of garlic cloves.  The milk in the soup proclaimed that the couple's life together would be pleasant; the garlic warned them to expect many disappointments.  The younger guests would generally bring it to husband and wife at the banquet table, heartily singing the song of their ancestors -- a sad ballad that was meant to make any bride of good stock weep with one eye and laugh with the other.  Then the bombardists (players of a 1-octave oboe) and bagpipers would strike up another milk-soup tune that was livelier and well known for its tendency to 'dry away the tears,' prompting all the people at the tables to loudly rejoice." 
I found the preceding recipe in the town of Guimiliau, also in Helias' Finisterre -- actually it was for sale as a book about Breton cooking in the Ossuary, or former bone house, of Guimiliau's parish close.  Maybe a sad statement about the preemption of old holy places for tourism -- yet a think piece about food and the beginnings of wedded life being served up in the place where food and life end physically...while they continue to feed the spiritual life of the village.

The recipe for that soup varied from one region to another and depended on the young people&apos;s imaginations, but it always included a string of garlic cloves.  The milk in the soup proclaimed that the couple&apos;s life together would be pleasant; the garlic warned them to expect many disappointments.  The younger guests would generally bring it to husband and wife at the banquet table, heartily singing the song of their ancestors -- a sad ballad that was meant to make any bride of good stock weep with one eye and laugh with the other.  Then the bombardists (players of a 1-octave oboe) and bagpipers would strike up another milk-soup tune that was livelier and well known for its tendency to &apos;dry away the tears,&apos; prompting all the people at the tables to loudly rejoice.&quot;

I found the preceding recipe in the town of Guimiliau, also in Helias&apos; Finisterre -- actually it was for sale as a book about Breton cooking in the Ossuary, or former bone house, of Guimiliau&apos;s parish close.  Maybe a sad statement about the preemption of old holy places for tourism -- yet a think piece about food and the beginnings of wedded life being served up in the place where food and life end physically...while they continue to feed the spiritual life of the village.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  vermicelli or fine egg noodles
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              whole  chicken breast -- cooked, julienned
  2                     green chilies -- chopped
  1                     tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2                     green onions -- sliced finely
                        on a diagonal
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped cilantro
                        Toasted sunflower or pumpkin seeds
  1                     avocado -- sliced thin

Break the pasta into 1/2-inch pieces and fry in the oil until it's brown.  Drain and add to the stock, while it is simmering in a saucepan.  Cook until just tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the chicken, tomato, green onion, and cook until the mixture is just heated through. 
Ladle into bowls, garnish sparcely with the cilantro, seeds, and avocado, and serve.  Pass separate bowls of the garnish. 
Comments:  It's a festive, rich red-and-green first course or light lunch; serve hot to 6 to 8 people; traditional Mexico on a holiday.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  bacon -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2              large  onions -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  thyme
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, diced
  2                     tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  fish stock
  3               cups  milk
  3               cups  cauliflower florets
  1 1/2         pounds  sea bass fillet -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  minced white part of green onions
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chips of cold butter
                        Minced green part of green onions

Fry bacon in a large saucepan over medium-low heat until it's just beginning to brown.  Remove and reserve -- and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat. 
Add 2 tablespoons of butter, then gently saute shallots, onion, and thyme until the onion is tender.  Add potato, tomato, salt, and pepper, and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Add milk and cauliflower, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes.  Season to taste. 
When ready to serve, add bass and the reserved bacon and simmer for about 3 minutes, until the fish is cooked through.  Stir in the white part of the green onion, then ladle into bowls.  Top each with a chip of butter and a sprinkling of the green onion. 
Comments:  Substantial and aromatic -- also great looking.  Serve hot to 4 people as a hearty meal with lots of bread and salad.  Did I tell you that "chowder" is an Americanization of the French word for cauldron, chaudiere?

                            Cheeseburger Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
     3/4           cup  shredded carrot
     3/4           cup  diced celery
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
                        (or, for fresher taste, pesto)
  1           teaspoon  dried parsley
                        (or, for fresher taste, 2 sprigs
                        minced fine)
  3               cups  chicken stock
  4               cups  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     1/4           cup  flour
  8             ounces  American cheese -- cubed (2 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  sour cream -- for garnish

First, brown the ground beef, drain and reserve it. 
Saute the onion, carrots, celery, basil, and parsley in 1 tablespoon of butter until they are tender.  Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.  Add potatoes and beef, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. 
In a small skillet, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter, stir in the flour, and cook on low until bubbly.  Whisk the milk into the roux and stir until thickened -- then stir it into the soup pot.  Bring to a boil, then stir in the cheese, salt, and pepper.  Cook until the cheese melts. 
When ready to serve, ladle into soup bowls, top each one with a spoonful of sour cream and swirl in. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people as a filling meal. 
Comments:  Quintessentially American, this soup looks for a long time like it's going to be terrible -- then suddenly it pulls together at the end and is unexpectedly rich and satisfying.  It was contributed by Pat and Elaine Young of Oregon, also quintessentially American and in the best of ways.  Hardworking and gutsy, they've got a son in highschool, are putting a daughter through college -- and still decided to make significant career changes as "40 somethings" to secure a better future in the long run.  Elaine got the recipe from her sister.

Comments:  Quintessentially American, this soup looks for a long time like it&apos;s going to be terrible -- then suddenly it pulls together at the end and is unexpectedly rich and satisfying.  It was contributed by Pat and Elaine Young of Oregon, also quintessentially American and in the best of ways.  Hardworking and gutsy, they&apos;ve got a son in highschool, are putting a daughter through college -- and still decided to make significant career changes as &quot;40 somethings&quot; to secure a better future in the long run.  Elaine got the recipe from her sister.

            Chicken Gumbo FilÈ Soup - {American - New Orleans}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              pound  chicken -- cut up
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  lard or vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme -- crushed
  10              cups  boiling water
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2         pound  country or smoked ham -- cubed
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cayenne
  1              quart  oysters with liquid
  3               cups  cooked rice
  2          teaspoons  filÈ powder

Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then slowly brown them in the lard (or oil).  When brown, remove the chicken pieces, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil and whisk in the flour, making a roux. 
Add the chopped onions, parsley, and thyme and fry for several minutes.  Pour in the boiling water, whisking hard, then add the bay leaf, cayenne, and country ham cubes.  Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for about an hour, until the chicken is tender. 
Pick out the chicken pieces, let cool a bit, then take off the bone -- stirring the meat back into the soup and discarding the bones and skin.  Taste for seasoning again, and add as much salt and pepper as you like. 
When ready to serve, pour in the oysters with their juice and stir in the cooked rice.  Turn up the heat and continue cooking for about 3 minutes.  Don't let the oysters overcook.  Remove gumbo from heat -- and add filÈ powder just before taking to the table. 
Serve hot with lots of crusty bread and butter to 6 as a meal. 
Comments:  Tangy with sassafras; full of the rich, complementary flavors of chicken and country ham; and positively bursting with juicy oysters -- what more could anyone want?  Betty Bordenave sent me this recipe, which she adapts from an Entergy Corporation cookbook called "From Woodstoves to Microwaves."  With her permission, I've adapted it a little bit more, taking the chicken off the bone (which she personally would never do) and stirring the rice in with the oysters to make it more of a soup.  Betty cautions that, just as the "old-timers" warn, "filÈ" should be added just before eating -- if you cook filÈ in the gumbo "it gets stringy, bitter and yukkie!"  But this recipe?  It's terrific.

              Chicken Noodle Soup With Pesto - {Italianate}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  zucchini cut into quarters or eighths
                        lengthwise, then sliced into triangles
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  2                     sundried tomatoes - (to 4) -- slivered
  1 1/2           cups  fine egg noodles
     3/4           cup  shredded chicken
  3        tablespoons  pesto -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

* Note: You can buy this in most supermarkets -- it lasts a long time in the refrigerator, longer if you freeze it and chip it out as needed.  To make from scratch, put a cup of fresh basil leaves in a blender or processor with 1/2 cup pine nuts or walnuts, 2 cloves of peeled garlic, and 3/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  Process until it's thoroughly mixed, then gradually pour in 1/2 cup of olive oil until it's thick and completely pureed. 
Combine broth, zucchini, slivered sun-dried tomatoes, and tomato paste in a Dutch oven and bring to a boil.  Stir in noodles and cook al dente, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken and pesto.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide among bowls and garnish with parsley. 
Comments:  It's a nice fragrant "i primi" for 8 people; serve hot; follow with Italian dishes.

  1                     green pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  3                     tomatoes - (to 4) -- skinned, seeded,
                        and finely chopped

                        and finely chopped
  1        large bunch  cilantro -- chopped fine
  1              large  red onion -- chopped fine
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
                        (or 2 jalapeÒo peppers, chopped fine)
  1                can  tomato juice - (46 oz)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Juice of 3 limes -- (optional)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Cilantro leaves for each bowl

Carefully chopped all the vegetables the same small size, then mix in with the tomato juice, oil, optional lime juice, sugar, salt, and pepper.  Let chill and cure in the refrigerator overnight. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top each one with a cilantro leaf. 
Serve cold to 4 to 6 people as a meal, 6 to 8 people as a first course. 
Comments:  This chunky variation of Gazpacho, contributed by Carol Jo Thomas, is so good that it shocked me out of my purist stance on the classic Spanish "pureed salad".  Carol Jo, a Southern California transplant to the Seattle area and a dedicated cook and trader on the stock market, serves this as a favorite summertime cooler to family and to guests.  She notes that while the soup has a high acid level, it is full of beneficial antioxidants.  I especially like it with a splash of lime juice (more acid!), which both blends and throws into high relief the crunch of the vegetables and the diversity of their flavors.  The even, fine dice of the vegetables makes a difference in the eating -- I recommend you take the trouble to chop carefully.  It's wonderful.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sea bass or striped bass
  1              pound  shrimp
  1              quart  clams or mussels
     1/4         pound  dried porcini mushrooms
  1                     West Coast crab or lobster
  3                     tomatoes - (to 4)
  1                     green pepper
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
  1               pint  red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Start by soaking the mushrooms in cold water, then prepare the seafood.  Cut the raw fish in serving-sized pieces.  Shell and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails intact.  Clean and steam the mussels or clams in a quart of water or stock for about 4 to 5 minutes (until the shells open) and save the liquid.  Break the crab apart or cut the lobster in pieces. 
Make the sauce.  Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, then saute the onion, garlic, mushrooms, and green pepper and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook down for a minute or two, then add the tomato paste, the wine, and 4 cups of the mussel or clam broth.  Salt and pepper to taste, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes. 
When ready to assemble, arrange the seafood in a large kettle: first the crab or lobster, then the fish, topped by the shrimp.  Bring the sauce to a boil, then pour into the kettle, cover, and cook on low heat for 8 minutes.  Toss in the mussels or clams (to reduce shell volume, you can wrench off and throw away half the shell before tossing in), cover, and heat for 2 more minutes. 
Bring the kettle to the table and ladle out.  Make sure everyone has big towels and nutcrackers and picks -- it's a gloriously messy meal. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8, heavy on the red wine and garlic bread. 
Comments:  This wonderful American fish stew hails from California, originally made by Italian-American (and some say Portuguese) fisherman along San Francisco's coast.  In any case, Cioppini means "fish stew" in Genoese dialect.  As with most fishermen stews, the ingredients aren't cast in stone -- but rather a result of the day's catch.  It's hard to beat James Beard's version in his New Fish Cookery, though you can certainly cut back on -- or substitute for -- the extravagance of seafood he recommends and still have a feast.

Start by soaking the mushrooms in cold water, then prepare the seafood.  Cut the raw fish in serving-sized pieces.  Shell and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails intact.  Clean and steam the mussels or clams in a quart of water or stock for about 4 to 5 minutes (until the shells open) and save the liquid.  Break the crab apart or cut the lobster in pieces. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the sauce.  Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, then saute the onion, garlic, mushrooms, and green pepper and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook down for a minute or two, then add the tomato paste, the wine, and 4 cups of the mussel or clam broth.  Salt and pepper to taste, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to assemble, arrange the seafood in a large kettle: first the crab or lobster, then the fish, topped by the shrimp.  Bring the sauce to a boil, then pour into the kettle, cover, and cook on low heat for 8 minutes.  Toss in the mussels or clams (to reduce shell volume, you can wrench off and throw away half the shell before tossing in), cover, and heat for 2 more minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the kettle to the table and ladle out.  Make sure everyone has big towels and nutcrackers and picks -- it&apos;s a gloriously messy meal. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8, heavy on the red wine and garlic bread.

Comments:  This wonderful American fish stew hails from California, originally made by Italian-American (and some say Portuguese) fisherman along San Francisco&apos;s coast.  In any case, Cioppini means &quot;fish stew&quot; in Genoese dialect.  As with most fishermen stews, the ingredients aren&apos;t cast in stone -- but rather a result of the day&apos;s catch.  It&apos;s hard to beat James Beard&apos;s version in his New Fish Cookery, though you can certainly cut back on -- or substitute for -- the extravagance of seafood he recommends and still have a feast.

                        Classic French Onion Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
  8               cups  thinly-sliced onions
  3        tablespoons  flour
  3             quarts  beef stock
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  brandy
  1           teaspoon  BV meat glaze
                        (or use Kitchen Bouquet in a pinch)
                        Grated Gruyere cheese
                        Grated Parmesan cheese
                        French bread
                        Olive oil

Melt the butter in a Dutch oven and add the onions, stirring constantly.  cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until soft. 
In the meantime, cut slices of French bread into 1/2-inch pieces and toast them at 350 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes -- until they are dry crusts. 
When the onions are soft, sprinkle them with flour, stir, then add 2 cups of beef stock and stir until the mixture is thickened.  Add the remaining stock, stir into 1 tablespoon of salt, the pepper, and the brandy.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for 1/2 hour to an hour.  Add the meat glaze and taste for seasoning. 
When you're ready to serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls and cover each with a thick handful of Gruyere cheese.  Top each with a piece of the toasted bread, which has been drizzled with olive oil.  Sprinkle it with the Parmesan, then run them under a broiler for a few minutes and carry out to the table. 
Comments:  Always serve this marvelous French country dish as a meal, lunch or dinner, with lots of salad and crusty French bread -- hot to 8 to 12 people.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped celery with leaves
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2) -- minced
  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with juice
  1          large can  Italian white beans (Cannelli)
  5               cups  beef or vegetable stock
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  extra-finely sliced, then
                        roughly chopped cabbage
  2                     zucchini -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into little cubes
     1/2           cup  ditalini (little tiny macaroni)
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

Saute the onion and celery in the oil until wilted, toss in garlic and stir for a minute, then put in cut-up tomatoes and cook down for about 10 minutes to concentrate flavors. 
Stir in beef stock, reserved tomato juice, and beans and bring to a boil.  Add half the parsley, lower heat, and cook for about 30 minutes. 
Add cabbage, zucchini, and ditalini and cook at a gentle boil until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the rest of the parsley, maybe sprinkle in some more minced garlic.  Season to taste and grate in some black pepper.  Ladle into bowls and pass the parmesan. 
Comments:  A rich and filling Italian soup for cold days and nights.  Serve hot in small portions to 6 to 8 for a nice start to a larger meal -- or to 4 who just want to stuff themselves on soup, bread, and maybe some red wine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  corn oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  5                     tomatillos -- husked, quartered
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced

                        and divided into two equal piles
  4               cups  vegetable stock
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  corn oil
  2              large  red bell peppers -- diced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- chopped fine
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                     tomato -- chopped with
                        Cilantro sprigs -- chopped with
                        Green onions -- chopped with
                        Lime juice

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan on high, then sautÈ the onion, tomatillos, and garlic for about 5 minutes, until softened.  Stir in half the corn kernels, 3 cups of stock, and the cilantro.  Heat to a boil, then purÈe in a blender, solids first. 
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan on high, then sautÈe the red pepper and jalapeÒo pepper for about 5 minutes, until softened.  Pour the purÈe back into the pot and stir in the rest of the corn, the remaining 1 cup of stock, and the sugar.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper. 
Chop the tomato, cilantro, and green onion into a relish, squeezing on lime juice. 
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into bowls and swirl the relish through each. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people as a first course. 
Comments:  Chunky, colorful, and with a pleasantly sour undertone to the sweet summer corn, this mostly all-New World soup is an excellent stimulant to appetites that flag in the summer heat.

                          Crab And Corn Chowder

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  flour - (to 4 tbspns)
  4               cups  fresh corn - (abt 6 ears)
                        (frozen corn is okay in a pinch)
  3               cups  chicken stock
  2                     potatoes -- cubed
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        (or substitute buttermilk)
     1/2         pound  backfin crabmeat -- picked over
                        (or use canned backfin,
                        it's excellent for soup)

Puree 2 cups of the corn until smooth, leaving the remaining two cups whole. 
Melt butter and saute onion and celery.  Sprinkle with flour and heat, stirring, until bubbly.  Stir in pureed corn and stock, bring to a boil, and whisk until thickened.  Add the potatoes and simmer 15 minutes until the pototo is tender. 
When 15 minutes from serving, stir in cream or buttermilk, crab, and corn and season with salt and pepper.  Bring just to boil, then lower heat and simmer 5 to 10 minutes.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with chopped celery leaves. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4 people...or as a substantial first course to 8. 
Comments:  This is one great meal -- thick, creamy, and rich, with the white of crab and potatoes contrasted with the yellow corn and green celery leaves.  It's simple and quick to make, immensely satisfying, and quite spectacular as company food.

Comments:  This is one great meal -- thick, creamy, and rich, with the white of crab and potatoes contrasted with the yellow corn and green celery leaves.  It&apos;s simple and quick to make, immensely satisfying, and quite spectacular as company food.

                 Cream Of Poblano Soup With Cheese Crust

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3             medium  poblano peppers -- seeded, chopped
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  4               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1              large  potato -- chopped
     1/2           cup  whipping cream or yogurt
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  8              large  tortilla chips
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack cheese

Heat the oil and butter in a large saucepan.  Add peppers, onions, and carrots and saute slowly for 5 minutes.  Stir in the stock, add the diced potatoes, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. 
Remove from heat and puree in a blender, solids first to get a smooth texture.  Return to the pot.  Add the cream and season with salt to taste. 
When ready to serve, bring to simmer and stir in the cilantro.  Ladle into oven-proof bowls, top with 2 tortilla chips, sprinkle with cheese, and run under the broiler.  Top each bowl with a cilantro leaf and take to the table. 
Serve to 4 people as a spectacular and hearty first course. 
Comments:  This Tex-Mex creation is a lot healthier than it tastes -- and is even more so if you substitute yogurt for the whipping cream.  It's gloriously thick and rich, with a nice balancing kick.  Thanks to Professor Vincent Tocci, American University, for introducing me to this.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  chayotes -- peeled, sliced
  2                     onions -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     potato -- grated
  3               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===

Pour the pureed chayote into the stock, stirring, and season to taste.  Let simmer, uncovered, for about 5 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, sprinkle a few green onion slices on each, squeeze in some fresh lemon, and top with a sprig of cilantro. 
Serve hot to 4 as a first course. 
Comments:  A delicate and interesting prelude to spicy Mexican food -- or to the most elegant many-course meal.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  escarole
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
  4               cups  weak vegetable or beef broth
     1/2           cup  raw rice/ preferably Italian Arborio
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Separate the escarole leaves and wash thorougly, discarding all wilted parts.  Cut into diagonal ribbons, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch wide. 
In a large saucepan, saute onions in butter over medium heat until they are browned.  Add the escarole ribbons and a little salt, and saute for a minute or two, stirring occasionally to coat the greens with butter. 
Add 1/2 cup stock, cover, and reduce heat.  Simmer until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Add the rest of the stock, bring to a boil, stir in the rice, then cover.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for about 15 to 20 minutes -- the rice should not be mushy. 
Remove from heat, stir in the Parmesan cheese, and adjust for seasoning.  Ladle into soup bowls and serve immediately. 
Comments:  This Italian soup is easy, filling, and tasty; serve hot as a first course to 4 people.

                        aren't sweet enough
  2        thin slices  day-old Italian bread -- crusts removed
  4               cups  beef, chicken, or vegetable stock
     1/2           cup  basil leaves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh marjoram or oregano
                        (can substitute 1/2 tspn of either dried)
                        === GARNISH ===
  6                     fresh basil leaves -- cut paper thin
                        strips

Saute onions, garlic, and celery in the oil over medium-low heat in a large saucepan, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are golden (about 20 minutes).  Add the tomatoes and salt.  Cook on medium, partially covered, until the tomatoes are softened -- about 20 minutes.  If you think it needs it, add a pinch of sugar to balance acidity. 
Tear the bread into pieces in a small bowl and pour in 1 cup of the hot broth.  Let it absorb and soften -- then mash it with a wooden spoon and scrape into the tomatoes.  Pour in the rest of the stock and bring to a boil, stirring well to completely dissolve the bread.  Turn the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. 
Add the herbs and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.  Season to taste. 
When ready to serve, ladle into soup bowls.  Garnish with shredded basil leaves and pour 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over each serving. 
Comments:  Wonderfully fresh and Italian, this hot soup for 4 to 6 practically comes with cows mooing and chickens scratching, it's that redolent of the countryside.  Chunky, filling, and unusually textured, it's a meal in itself.

                        = {Soupe D'Artichauts Perigourdine} =
  3              small  onions -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  bacon fat
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz) -- seeded, chopped,
                        reserving liquid
  4               cups  chicken stock
  4                     cooked artichoke bottoms -- diced
                        (or one 8-oz package of frozen
                        artichoke hearts, quartered)
  4        thick slabs  toasted French bread -- for garnish

It's an easy, attractive, and filling soup for you artichoke diehards out there.  Serve hot over toasted French bread to four for lunch or a light dinner.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        = {Creme De Chou-Fleur Iseult ¿ La
                        Bretagne} =
  1              small  cauliflower head
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1              pinch  nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  shrimp -- cooked, peeled
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  12                    reserved shrimp -- cut lengthwise
                        into thin silhouettes
                        Finely-snipped chives

Break the cauliflower into equally sized florets, blanch them in salted, boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain. 
In a large saucepan, melt the butter, scrape in the onion, and cook on low for 5 to 10 minutes, so that the onion is soft but not colored.  Add the blanched cauliflower and toss to coat.  Pour in the stock, season with nutmeg, salt and papper, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and gently simmer for about 15 minutes, when the cauliflower is cooked through. 
After removing the best 12 shrimp for the garnish, put the rest of the shrimp into a blender and chop.  Gradually add the cauliflower and stock, so that the shrimp is completely pureed into the soup -- then return the soup to the pan. 
When ready to serve, reheat and stir in the cream.  Taste for seasoning.  Ladle into bowls, and arrange the shrimp silhouettes into a pattern in the middle of each.  Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately, thinking of Iseult and the "white birds flying, Flying, and always flying, and still flying, And the white sunlight flashing on the sea." 
Serve hot as a first course to 4 people. 
Comments:  Here is a soup named after a character in the tragic legend of Tristram and Iseult (or Tristran and Isolde, according to Wagner's opera).  This Iseult is not the Irish one promised to King Mark, the one who fatally drinks the love potion with Tristan.  This Iseult is Brittany's princess and Tristan's wife -- "Iseult of the White Hands" -- who, abandoned by him and learning of his death, still stands on Brittany's shore, gazing north "Alone, with her white face and her gray eyes."  This elegant soup has the tang of the sea, the robustness of Breton earth, and is creamy white with just a hint of color -- like poor Iseult's wind-lashed grieving face.

             French Cream Of Lettuce Soup - {Soupe De Laitue}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced fine
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2               cups  finely-shredded romaine lettuce
  1                cup  finely-chopped watercress
  4               cups  beef or vegetable stock
  2                     egg yolks
  2               cups  light cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat butter in a large saucepan, then saute garlic, parsley, tarragon, and onion until the onion is transparent.  Add the lettuce and watercress, and stir over low heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in the beef stock and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, beat the egg yolks and the cream together with several tablespoons of the hot soup, then pour in, stirring constantly over low heat until the soup thickens slightly.  Stir in salt and pepper and serve immediately. 
Comments:  Sounds bland, but isn't.  This savory and attractive French first-course soup for 6 has a wonderful consistency and is distinctive enough to set up strongly flavored courses; silken enough in texture to make you champ at the bit to eat more.

                        quarter pieces
  2                     celery stalks, with leaves -- chopped
  2                     zucchini -- cubed
  3                     potatoes -- cubed
  15                    green beans -- cut small pieces
  3                     fresh tomatoes (or 6 canned) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PISTOU GARNISH ===
  6                     garlic cloves
  4        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley - (to 4 tbspns)

In a large soup pot, bring the soaked beans and fresh water to a boil.  Add all the vegetables and herbs, bring to a second boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer for an hour. 
Meanwhile, make the pistou if you don't have any handy in the freezer.  Press the garlic, then whisk the tomato paste, basil, cheese, oil, and parsley with it in a blender until it is a rich paste. 
Add the salt and pepper to the soup, stir well, and continue simmering uncovered for another 15 to 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into big bowls.  Pass the pistou -- and extra Parmesan cheese, if you like -- so people can load up the bowl with flavor that releases itself right under their noses. 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people.  And don't forget the crusty bread and wine. 
Comments:  Leave it to the French to create a perfectly pure and boring vegetable soup -- then lift it to astonishing heights by the last minute addition of pistou, an intense concentration of garlic, cheese, oil, and tomato paste that knocks those poor little naked veggies ecstatically flat.  This is a simplified version of the recipe my fishing buddy Susan Eggert gave me -- I like it because it's so simple I don't put off making it...especially when I've got leftover frozen pistou in the freezer.

                 French Pumpkin Soup - {Soupe Au Potiron}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  pumpkin or other winter squash -- peeled and cubed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Water or chicken stock -- just to cover
  2             wedges  Laughing Cow cheese ("La Vache Qui Rit")
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

Put the cubed pumpkin, salt, and pepper in a saucepan and just cover with water or stock.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until the pumpkin is just tender. 
PurÈe in a blender, solids first, then pop in the cheese wedges and process until they are melted into the soup.  Right before serving, stir in the lemon juice. 
Pour into bowls, top each with a sprinkle of minced parsley, and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 people as a light and creamy first course.  It is also quite wonderful served cold. 
Comments:  This beautifully colored soup is compliments of Mme. Marie-Josie Diacre, my professor in Tours, France, during the summer of '99.  She dashed the recipe off from memory on my last day of class (see below) -- along with its summer squash cousin, Soupe · la courgette.  She was a wonderful teacher -- and an enthusiastic cook for her husband, 3 sons, and 5 grandchildren.  Many thanks to her, even if I was a blockheaded student.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1             medium  zucchini -- chopped
  1              small  eggplant -- chopped (abt a cup)
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- chopped
                        (you can substitute green or red)
  2             pounds  fresh or canned tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-sliced fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        (or 1/4 tspn dried thyme)
  2               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt - (ideally, sea salt,
                        that great sel de mer from France)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Balsamico vinegar
                        Fresh basil shreds

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, saute the onion and garlic in the oil for about 3 minutes over medium heat, then toss in the eggplant, zucchini, and pepper and saute, stirring from time to time, another 5 minutes. 
Cut in the tomatoes with their juice and stir.  Stir in the basil, thyme, stock, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. 
If you are going to serve the soup hot and chunky, ladle it into bowls immediately.  Spoon a little balsamic vinegar over each serving and sprinkle with fresh basil. 
If you'd like to serve it as a puree, ladle the solids into the blender first, then thin with the broth.  You can serve it hot immediately -- or chill and serve it cold.  In all cases, garnish each bowl at serving time with a dribble of balsamico and fresh basil shreds. 
The soup is also good as a chunky cold soup -- it's nicely substantial for a refreshing summer lunch. 
Serve to 4 to 6 people, depending on whether it's to be a meal or a hearty first course. 
Comments:  This soup version of the classic Provencal dish is good hot or cold, pureed or not, as a first course or a meal.  Talk about a soup for all seasons.  And even the fussiest eaters like it pureed...so long as you don't tell them that eggplant is in it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  zucchini -- scrubbed, and
                        sliced into rounds
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed or chopped
                        Fresh or dried thyme -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Water or chicken stock -- just to cover
  4             wedges  Laughing Cow cheese ("La Vache Qui Rit")
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

Put the sliced zucchini, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper in a saucepan and just cover with water or stock.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until the zucchini is just tender -- about 10 minutes. 
Puree in a blender, solids first, then pop in the cheese wedges and process until they are melted into the soup. 
Pour into bowls, top each with a sprinkle of minced parsley, and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 people as light, creamy, and flavorful first course.  It is also quite wonderful served cold. 
Comments:  This marvelous and practically instant soup is compliments of Mme. Marie-Josie Diacre, my professor of French at the Touraine Institute in France this summer of '99.  She was a wonderful teacher -- and clearly is an excellent cook for her husband, 3 sons, and 5 grandchildren.  Her original recipe is reproduced below.  I believe it is a general favorite in French home cooking, as my dear friend Danielle Moreau independently recommended it to me, but cooked with chicken stock instead of water.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     onions -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     potatoes -- peeled, chopped
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     3/4           cup  chopped cilantro

In a large saucepan, saute the onions and garlic in 3 tablespoons of oil for 5 minutes, until limp, then add the last tablespoon of oil and the potatoes and stir-fry for a minute.  Add the stock, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, until the potatoes are mushy.  Remove from heat and puree. 
Return the soup to the pot, season with salt and cayenne, and stir in the chopped cilantro.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  You can serve the soup cold -- or reheat by slowly bringing it to a simmer.  Ladle into soup plates and top with a sprinkling of cilantro or chives. 
Comments:  Simple and satisfying, truly Portuguese; serve hot or cold to 6 to 8 people.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     corn ears - (to 6)
                        (to make 2 cups of corn and corn milk)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  flour
  3 1/2           cups  milk
                        chicken stock concentrate for 2 cups -- (optional)
                        (either soup base or bouillon cube)
  1              small  onion -- stuck with
  3                     whole cloves
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1              pinch  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Shuck and desilk the corn.  Cut the kernels of each thinly with a sharp knife into a bowl, then, with the flat of the blade, press out all the remaining milk of the cob into the same bowl.  Set aside. 
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan, scrape in the pepper, and saute over medium high heat until the pepper is soft.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for several minutes.  Gradually stir in the milk/stock combination and bring to a boil.  Pop in the clove studded onion.  Reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. 
Add the corn mixture; stir in the cream and sugar; season to taste.  Return to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently for about 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, remove the cloved onion, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, ladle into bowls, and serve immediately. 
Comments:  Adapted from the manuscript recipes of the Shaker Sisters, this rich and beautiful soup is truly a simple gift to serve and give thanks for.  Use the freshest and tenderest corn you can find.  Serve hot to 4 as a first course.  And just imagine the summer heat of the kitchen of these members of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing.  Back in the middle of the 19th century, when these celibate, dancing Believers stretched from New England to Ohio and Kentucky, the Sisters kept huge iron soup kettles tidily hung on brackets over the fireplace, where they simmered all through the day.  Great love and thanks to Nancy Solley, who took me to the Shaker Community at Pleasant Hill, Kentucky, and treated me to my first bowl of Shaker Corn Chowder.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with juice
                        (or 4 cups peeled tomatoes and 1 cup
                        tomato juice)
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                     red pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1                     celery stalk with leaves -- chopped
     1/4                onion -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  minced thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        Juice of 1 lime
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce - (scant)
  8                     ice cubes
  1         thin slice  cucumber per bowl -- for garnish

Place all ingredients except the ice cubes in a blender and puree until smooth.  Chill in the blender until you are ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, add the ice cubes and re-blend.  This should give the soup a quick and unusual slush.  Pour the soup into bowls and float a slice of cucumber on top of each. 
Serve cold to 4 to 6 people as a refreshing and ample first course. 
Comments:  This excellent variation of the Spanish "pureed salad" classic was sent to me by Marty Beard, a Communications grad student at Stanford U. who sweet-talked Austin, TX, columnist Jane Grieg into getting the recipe from a local Austin restaurant.  With a little adaptation, it's gazpacho with a little bit of the dark side -- more complex and shaded than standard, very satisfying and fullbodied.  Thanks again, Marty!

  4             quarts  water - (to 5 qts)
                        (a quart per pound of chicken)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Unborn egg yolks from the chicken's ovary
                        or "egg balls" -- see * Note

* Note:  Made by pounding the hard boiled yolks of 3 eggs with a little flour and salt, then stirring in the raw yolk of an egg and rolling the mixture into little balls. 
Bring the hen and her parts to a quick boil in the water and carefully skim the foam before adding the vegetables and seasonings.  Add the onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, peppercorns, and salt.  Simmer gently for 2 1/2 hours.  Strain carefully, using the chicken meat for another recipe and throw out the remaining bones, vegetables, and seasonings. 
If you have the chicken ovary at the ready, return the broth to a simmer when you are ready to serve the soup and slip in the unborn eggs. 
If you are taking the "egg ball" route, return the broth to a boil, drop the little balls into the pot, cover, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes.  (You can also cook these in boiling water in advance, then add to the simmering broth when you are ready to serve it.) 
Serve hot to 8 to 10 people. 
Comments:  With great thanks and appreciation to reknowned cartoonist Sidney Harris and Dutch hydrologist Wiebe van der Molen.  This is a story as much about lost American soup traditions as it is about my own ignorance and about international problem solving on the Web. 
It all began when I contacted Mr. Harris, as part of my Faves of the Stars! effort, and asked him if he would contribute his favorite soup.  He was kind enough to respond with what he said was not necessarily his favorite soup, but that "certainly was unique and memorable."  To wit, a chicken soup made many years ago by his grandmother in Brooklyn "that contained tiny eggs (yolks only)...and I very much enjoyed these little round yolks." 
Tiny egg yolks in soup?  I had never heard of such a thing...nor did anyone else I asked...nor did the combined food resources of two different libraries. 
I suggested the possibility of farfel, small egg-rich dumplings also known as "egg barley"??? 
No, Mr. Harris said, "they were definitely eggs -- but, as I mentioned, appeared to be only yolks.  They varied in size, and were close to the size of a marble.  There would be a few in a bowl of soup -- 3 or 4.  It's possible she bought live chickens, and found these very young eggs in the bird." 
At this point I turned to the Web, ultimately locating a Dutch hydrologist who'd graduated in Agricultural Engineering in 1949, helped drain an inland sea in the Zuiderzee polders for agriculture, taught at Wageningen Agricultural University in the Netherlands until retirement -- and along the way built a henhouse and began raising and observing chickens. 
Oh yes, he assured me, tiny yolks in chicken soup are entirely possible, so long as the chicken is freshly slaughtered.  One simply removes the chicken's ovary and releases the cache of unborn egg yolks into the simmering broth. 
Here is how he described the process:  "Producing an egg is similar to making a car.  You start with something, put it on a conveyor belt and add all things that are needed.  So does the hen.  She starts with the yolk.  She has thousands of very small ones and some of them start growing.  So it looks like a bundle of grapes, with a big one for tomorrow, a smaller one for the day after and a still smaller one for the next day (but she might take a day off now and then).  Old granny obviously slaughtered a chicken, took the ovary out and used the unborn yolks for her soup.  Nothing wrong with it. 
"...When the yolk is fully grown, it is released from the ovary and falls into a large funnel at the beginning of a long tube, the oviduct.  This acts as a conveyor belt: egg white is added, then the chalaza (the two wound-up strings at either end of the yolk) and finally the shell.  Then it has come nearly at the end of the journey, but there it is halted for a long time.  Adding white does not take much time, perhaps 1 to 2 hours, but making the shell lasts about 24 hours.  When finished, but still inside, it is already hard.  It is the same material as limestone: calcium carbonate. 
"...Immediately after laying, a new yolk is released.  But the process takes longer than a day, and when the egg comes around noon, the animal takes a day off and starts very early the next.  A well-behaved chicken, therefore, lays some 6 eggs per week." 
So what about the final recipe?  Here it is -- and with a reasonable facsimile substitution for the unborn eggs for those of us who don't slaughter our own chickens.  I found this "egg ball" recipe in a 19th century American cookbook.

                     Grover Soup - (without remorse)

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- mashed, then
                        lightly chopped
  2                     red peppers -- chopped
  1                can  dark red kidney beans - (16 oz) -- with juice
  1                cup  chopped fresh or canned tomatoes
  4               cups  vegetable stock
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  2              large  dried ancho chilies -- soaked in hot water,
                        seeded, and cut thin strips that can
                        easily fit on a soupspoon
  1           teaspoon  oregano -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  grated smoked cheese (Cheddar or Edam) -- beaten with
  1                cup  sour cream
                        Finely-minced cilantro
                        Tortilla chips - (large)

In a large saucepan, saute the onion, garlic, and red pepper in oil until the onion is just beginning to brown. 
While vegetables are cooking, puree the kidney beans with their juice and with the tomatoes in a blender until smooth. 
When the onions are done, pour in the stock, puree, tomato paste, ancho chilies, oregano, cumin, and black pepper.  Stir well, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 45 minutes -- stirring occasionally. 
When ready to serve, grate the cheese and beat it into the sour cream.  Mince the cilantro.  Then ladle soup into flat soup bowls.  Spoon the cheese-cream thickly in a cross shape (for Grover's patience) across each bowl -- sprinkle with cilantro -- and stick one tortilla chip in the center.  Pass a bowl of tortilla chips separately. 
Serve hot to 6 to 8 people who aren't afraid of hot chile peppers!  It's good as a light lunch or substantial first course. 
Comments:  Here's to Grover, my server wizard, who houses this website and who has met all my not-so-smart questions and requests with infinite patience and humor.  Thank you, Grover.  I think this rich and visual vegetarian brew -- based on a peppery tomato soup of the Tarascan Indians (Michoacan, Mexico) -- begins to approach my take on your own complexity and love of art.  Thanks again, Grover!

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  Portuguese sausage -- cut 1/4" slices
                        (or substitute other garlicky sausage)
  1              large  onion -- chopped coarsely
  2                big  carrots -- chopped coarsely
  4               cups  chicken stock
     1/2         pound  tomato -- peeled, diced
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2                     or more ham shanks (smoked pork hocks)
  3                     potatoes -- peeled, cubed
  1                     bay leaf - (to 2)
  1           teaspoon  paprika, or to taste
                        Chili oil or cayenne -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cans  dark red kidney beans - (15 oz ea)

In a Dutch oven, sautÈ the sausage slices with the onions and carrots over medium heat until the onion is soft, stirring from time to time.  Add the remaining ingredients -- except for the beans -- bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours. 
Fifteen minutes before serving, remove the hocks and pick off the meat, discarding the fat and bones.  Mince the meat and return to the pot with the beans, juice and all.  Let simmer for a few minutes, then ladle up into bowls and dig in -- 'ai a ma'ona.  Da best! 
Serve hot as a meal to 6 to 8 people. 
Comments:  This rich and substantial soup is classic Island fare, drawing on its Portuguese cultural roots...and humorous prejudices (see below).  I am indebted to Reiko Callner -- now of Olympia, Washington, but formerly of Waimanalo -- both for contributing the recipe and for stirring up memories of my 4 years in Kailua, surely the happiest years of my very happy life.  Reiko and I bonded in homesickness over this recipe -- and you are welcome to join us. 
A Hawaiian, a Japanese, and a Portuguese were doing construction work on scaffolding on the 20th floor of a Waikiki building.  One day as they were eating lunch, the Hawaiian said, "Fish and Poi!  If I get Fish and poi one more time for lunch I'm going to jump off this building."  The Japanese opened his lunch box and exclaimed, "Sushi again!  If I get sushi one more time I'm going to jump off, too."  The Portuguese opened his lunch and said, "Portuguese sausage and rice again.  If I get a Portuguese sausage and rice one more time I'm jumping off also!" 
Next day the Hawaiian opens his lunchbox, sees the fish and poi and jumps to this death.  The Japanese opens his lunch, sees sushi and jumps too.  The Portuguese opens his lunch, sees the Portuguese Sausage and rice and jumps to his death also. 
At the funeral, the Hawaiian man's wife is weeping.  She says, "If I'd known how really tired he was of fish and poi I never would have given it to him again!"  The Japanese man's wife also weeps and says, "I could have given him teriyaki or tempura!"  I didn't realize he hated sushi so much."  Everyone turned and stared at the Portuguese man's wife.  "Hey, no look at me" she said.  "Da bugga makes his own lunch!"

Comments:  This rich and substantial soup is classic Island fare, drawing on its Portuguese cultural roots...and humorous prejudices (see below).  I am indebted to Reiko Callner -- now of Olympia, Washington, but formerly of Waimanalo -- both for contributing the recipe and for stirring up memories of my 4 years in Kailua, surely the happiest years of my very happy life.  Reiko and I bonded in homesickness over this recipe -- and you are welcome to join us.

<DirT>
A Hawaiian, a Japanese, and a Portuguese were doing construction work on scaffolding on the 20th floor of a Waikiki building.  One day as they were eating lunch, the Hawaiian said, &quot;Fish and Poi!  If I get Fish and poi one more time for lunch I&apos;m going to jump off this building.&quot;  The Japanese opened his lunch box and exclaimed, &quot;Sushi again!  If I get sushi one more time I&apos;m going to jump off, too.&quot;  The Portuguese opened his lunch and said, &quot;Portuguese sausage and rice again.  If I get a Portuguese sausage and rice one more time I&apos;m jumping off also!&quot; 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Next day the Hawaiian opens his lunchbox, sees the fish and poi and jumps to this death.  The Japanese opens his lunch, sees sushi and jumps too.  The Portuguese opens his lunch, sees the Portuguese Sausage and rice and jumps to his death also. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
At the funeral, the Hawaiian man&apos;s wife is weeping.  She says, &quot;If I&apos;d known how really tired he was of fish and poi I never would have given it to him again!&quot;  The Japanese man&apos;s wife also weeps and says, &quot;I could have given him teriyaki or tempura!&quot;  I didn&apos;t realize he hated sushi so much.&quot;  Everyone turned and stared at the Portuguese man&apos;s wife.  &quot;Hey, no look at me&quot; she said.  &quot;Da bugga makes his own lunch!&quot;

                          Hearty ProvenÁal Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/4         pound  bacon -- cut small pieces
  1                     onion -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     red or green bell pepper -- cut bite-sized
  2                     zucchini -- cubed
  25                    green beans -- sliced thickly
  4             ounces  gourmet black olives - (preferably
                        nicoise,
                        but kalamata are fine)
  2        tablespoons  anchovy paste
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh mint
  6                     fresh tomatoes (or 10 canned tomatoes) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  3             medium  potatoes -- peeled and cubed
  8               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a Dutch oven, then toss in the bacon pieces, onion, and garlic.  SautÈ for about 3 minutes over medium heat, then add the peppers, zucchini, beans, olives, anchovy paste, and mint. 
Stir well, reduce the heat, and cook on low for 10 more minutes.  Add the tomatoes and potatoes and cook 10 more minutes, stirring from time to time. 
Pour in the stock and bring to a boil, then cook on medium heat for 10 minutes -- season to taste with salt and pepper, and let simmer for another 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, check one more time for seasoning.  Ladle into big bowls and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a light meal. 
Comments:  Quite unusual, I think, combining many foods associated with Provence, but not ordinarily in a soup.  Mixed into a fairly standard vegetable soup are black olives -- and make sure they're of the best quality -- as well as a paste of anchovies and mint.  Excellent!  It's perfect for lunch, with crusty bread on the side.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HONEYED POTATO SOUP ===
  3               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1              pound  potatoes - (abt 3 med) -- peeled, and
                        cut into same-sized chunks
                        (or sweet potatoes/ although they will
                        change the colors of the Mexican flag)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     onion -- cut in chunks
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        === SERRANO-TOMATILLO SOUP ===
  1              pound  tomatillos -- husks removed
  4                     serrano chilies -- cored and seeded
  1                cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
     3/4           cup  roughly-chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  lard
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Finely-minced sweet red pepper

Make the potato soup in one large saucepan:  Bring the stock to a boil, add the potato and onion chunks, and salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Puree in a blender, then blend in the cream and the honey.  Pour back into the saucepan and keep on a bare simmer. 
Make the serrano-tomatillo soup in another saucepan:  Bring the water to a boil, add the whole tomatillos and serranos, and salt lightly.  Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Puree in a blender with the chopped cilantro.  Heat the lard in the saucepan and saute the finely chopped onion until transparent.  Pour in the soup, bring to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, pour the potato soup into each flat soup bowl in equal portions, not filling too high.  Carefully pour a scant cup of the tomatillo soup directly in the middle of each bowl of potato soup and swirl through.  Sprinkle the chopped red pepper in the center of each and serve immediately. 
Serve this spectacular first course to 4 to 6 people in flat soup plates as a first course. 
Comments:  Visually resplendant -- and gastronomically exciting -- this double soup is easy to make and worth it even if it weren't.  The sweetness and creaminess of the potato soup foundation perfectly sets off the complex tang of the serrano chile-tomatillo soup swirled into its center -- and they are scrumptious eaten together with a sprinkling of finely chopped red pepper. 
(Created in honor of Pope John Paul II's triumphant return to Mexico)

                 Italian Chickpea Soup - {Zuppa Di Ceci}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cans  chickpeas - (16 oz ea)
                        (also sold as garbanzos)
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- peeled
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rosemary -- crushed to powder
     2/3           cup  coarsely-cut canned tomatoes -- with their juice
  2 1/2           cups  vegetable or weak beef stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large saucepan, saute the garlic cloves in oil until they are well browned, then discard (or eat).  Stir in the powdered rosemary, then the tomatoes and their juice.  Cook down over medium heat until the tomatoes separate from their juice, about 20 minutes. 
Add the chickpeas with their liquid and cook for 5 minutes, stirring.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, cover, and boil over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Add more stock as necessary to give the soup the consistency of cream. 
Adjust for seasoning, boil another minute, and ladle into bowls.  Garnish with a sprinkling of parsley.  If it goes with the meal, you can splash a little red wine into each bowl. 
Comments:  There's no mistaking this distinctive and rosemary-rich Italian soup; serve hot as a first course to 4 to 6 people.

In a large saucepan, saute the garlic cloves in oil until they are well browned, then discard (or eat).  Stir in the powdered rosemary, then the tomatoes and their juice.  Cook down over medium heat until the tomatoes separate from their juice, about 20 minutes.

Add the chickpeas with their liquid and cook for 5 minutes, stirring.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, cover, and boil over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Add more stock as necessary to give the soup the consistency of cream.

Adjust for seasoning, boil another minute, and ladle into bowls.  Garnish with a sprinkling of parsley.  If it goes with the meal, you can splash a little red wine into each bowl.

Comments:  There&apos;s no mistaking this distinctive and rosemary-rich Italian soup; serve hot as a first course to 4 to 6 people.

                          Italian Egg Drop Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable, chicken, veal, or beef stock
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crushed
                        (or 1 tbspn fresh oregano)
  2                     eggs
  3          teaspoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated dry bread crumbs
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed

Beat the eggs, cheese, bread crumbs, and garlic in a small bowl.  Bring the stock to a boil, add the crushed oregano, reduce the heat, and let simmer for 10 minutes. 
Increase the heat to medium, then stir the egg mixture into the stock with a long wooden spoon, so as to cause long egg strands. 
Serve immediately, garnishing with fresh oregano or parsley -- or by floating a round, paper thin lemon slice on top. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Like Stracciatelle, this Italian egg soup can serve as a light opener to spur the appetite.

         Italian Flag Potato Soup With Carrots And Turnips - ...

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        = {Minestrina Tricolore} =
  3                     potatoes -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     turnip -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  5         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  weak vegetable or beef stock
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Put potatoes in a large saucepan and just cover with water.  Bring to a boil, cover, and cook on medium heat until the potatoes are tender.  Puree them in their liquid and set aside. 
In another large saucepan, saute the onion with all the butter and oil until it is golden.  Add the carrot and turnip, and cook for 2 minutes.  Don't overcook -- they've got to keep their crunch. 
Pour the potatoes into the vegetables, stir in the cheese, milk, and stock, and bring to a good simmer.  Cook for a few minutes, stirring, season to taste, then remove from the heat. 
Stir in the parsley, ladle into bowls, and serve immediately, passing a separate dish of freshly grated Parmesan on the side. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a first course. 
Comments:  It's lovely to look at -- "tricolore" like the Italian flag, with the white of the potato, the orange of carrot, and the green of parsley.

                        cut into a 1/2" dice
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock

                 Italian Wedding Soup - {Zuppa Maritata}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  beef broth
     1/2           cup  pastina or broken up vermicelli
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  4                     egg yolks
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste

Cook pasta in lots of salted water until tender.  Drain and reserve. 
Beat the butter, eggs, and nutmeg, then whip in the grated cheese.  Gradually beat in the cream, spoonful by spoonful. 
Bring the broth to a simmer.  Lighten the cream mixture with 1/4 cup of the hot broth, then stir the cream-broth into the simmering pot, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat and continue stirring, as it thickens up a little bit. 
Season to taste.  Stir in reserved pasta.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately for luck and love to the happy couple and their wedding party. 
Comments:  This rich, elegant soup serves 4 to 6 -- that is, the bridal couple plus the best man and maid of honor -- or the bridal couple with parents.  Make more for a traditional Italian wedding party.  Serve it hot -- and assemble at the table for a grand effect.

         Italian White Bean Soup With Broccoli And Prosciutto Ham

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- sliced thin rings
  2             medium  leeks, white and light green parts -- washed, and
                        sliced into rings
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     3/4           cup  dried cannellini (white) beans -- soaked 6 hours,
                        and drained
                        (or a 28 oz can of them, drained)
  1                     bouquet garni -- of
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  peppercorns -- plus
                        thyme -- plus
                        parsley -- and
  1                     bay leaf -- tied in cheesecloth
  8               cups  water
     1/2           cup  finely-minced prosciutto ham
  4               cups  broccoli florets in small bites
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

If you are using dried beans, soak them for at least 6 hours. 
To start the soup, saute onions, leeks, celery, and garlic in the butter and oil on medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Pour in the water and the drained beans, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and plunge in the bouquet garni of herbs.  Simmer for 2 hours (less if you are using drained, canned beans). 
When beans are completely tender, remove the bouquet garni, and season to taste.  You can leave at a low simmer at this point. 
When ready to serve, stir in the prosciutto ham and the broccoli.  You don't want to do this earlier, because the broccoli will turn color.  Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the broccoli is just tender. 
Stir in the balsamic vinegar and grind a little more fresh pepper into the soup.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with generous handfuls of fresh grated Parmesan cheese. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4, with lots of crusty bread. 
Comments:  This hearty Tuscan soup is a superb blend of textures and flavors and colors -- and is incredibly rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes -- or to taste
  3              large  yellow bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into big pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  vegetable or beef stock

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add onion and garlic and cook until golden, stirring often -- for about 10 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of capers and the red pepper flakes, and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring often. 
Add yellow peppers and salt, cover, and cook 10 minutes, shaking often.  Add stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes -- until the peppers are soft. 
Puree the mixture, then strain back into the saucepan.  To hold, refrigerate at this point. 
When ready to serve, warm up over low heat, ladle into bowls, garnish each with a few capers, and serve. 
Comments:  A beautiful soup -- golden yellow in color and of medium consistency -- that sets off both humdrum and exotic dinners to a "T"; serve hot as a first course to 4 people.

        Jocoque Soup - {Mexican Vegetable Soup Over A Sweet Torte}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  carrots -- peeled, and
                        sliced into very thin rounds
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo pepper -- seeds removed,
                        then sliced in very thin circles
     1/4         pound  zucchini -- sliced thin rounds
  4                     canned tomatoes - (to 5) -- seeded, then
                        finely chopped and rechopped so they look
                        like confetti in the final dish
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
     1/4      teaspoon  oregano -- crumbled
  1                     fresh parsley sprig -- minced
                        === FOR THE TORTE ===
  1                     egg white
  2                     egg yolks
  1                cup  sour cream (or jocoque)
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Make the torte first.  Lightly beat egg white with 2 egg yolks -- then whip in sour cream (or jocoque), flour, and sugar.  Scrape into a small greased pan or baking dish (about 8- by 4-inch) and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes -- it will puff high and slightly brown on the edges. 
Once you put the torte in the oven, you can begin the soup.  Heat the oil in a large saucepan and toss in the onion, carrot, and hot pepper.  Cook over medium-low until the onion is translucent.  Add the zucchini, toss for a minute -- then add the minced tomato and cook until thick, stirring occasionally.  When thick, pour in the stock, crumbled in the oregano, and add the minced parsley.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. 
When ready to serve, unmold the torte and cut into 4 equal pieces -- placing one in each of the 4 flat, wide serving bowls.  Ladle the broth and vegetables over the torte in each bowl and serve immediately. 
Serve hot in flat, wide soup bowls to 4 people.  It is an excellent prelude to any number of Mexican or other main dishes.  It's a great start, in fact, to a roast or barbeque chicken. 
Comments:  Jocoque is a Mexican-style sour cream, somewhere between salted buttermilk and a thin sour cream and ranging in taste from tangy to sharp.  What makes this soup quite unusual is its odd juxtapositions -- sweet and savory, bland and piquante, liquid and solid, with unexpected textures and with a wonderfully festive look.  In fact, it's a complete surprise to eat -- and in the most positive way.  It's adapted from Guadalupe Rivera's Recipes and Reminiscences of Life with Frida Kahlo, her stepmother.

                        Dried basil -- to taste
                        Thyme -- to taste

Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil.  Add the rest of the ingredients, season to taste with basil and thyme, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat and cook about 20 minutes to cook the rice.  Serve hot.  It should not need much salt. 
Judy says, "I never make this soup exactly the same twice.  It depends on what I have on hand.  It is easy, quick, not too heavy, and tastes wonderful."  I agree -- I made it twice with different herbs and beans -- threw in some tired vegetables from the fridge, too. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  If ever there was a pure American Frontier soup, this is it.  In fact, it reminds me of American novelist Willa Cather's recipe for Vegetable Soup, from vegetables that are "run through a grinder then home canned; then in Winter add contents of jar to soup stock" -- from a handwritten note she put inside her copy of The White House Cook Book.  Judy Teeter, who contributed the preceding recipe, is a true New Mexican, creative cook, passionate singer (who sings with the local chorale), and is from Los Lunas, New Mexico -- far from Cather's 19th century Nebraska.  But the end product is pure and hearty anywhere, anyhow.  Judy says it's great "for when time is short, but you want something really good!"

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  brill -- filleted
  1                     sole -- filleted
  1              small  eel -- filleted
                        Brill, sole, and eel trimmings and bones -- from the above
  1             bottle  champagne
  1                     lemon -- pulped
                        Parings of the pound of truffles
  2                     onions -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
  2                     leeks -- finely chopped
     1/2                bay leaf
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  2                     whole cloves
  2                     anchovies -- well rinsed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Veal stock
  1              large  whiting
                        Crayfish butter
                        Consomme
  1              pound  truffles -- pared
                        Consomme
  20                    mushrooms
  24                    oysters
  24                    shrimp
  24                    crayfish tails
                        Consomme

First make the fish stock:  In a pot combine the fish bones and trimmings, the champagne, lemon pulp, truffle parings, onions, carrot, celery, leeks, bay leaf, nutmeg, cayenne, cloves, anchovies, and salt -- bring to a boil, then simmer for an hour.  Put through a silk sieve and pour it into a good veal stock. 
Then make fish scallops:  Saute the filets of brill, sole, and eel and shape them into scallops. 
Then make quenelles:  make a forcemeat of the whiting and crayfish butter.  Use coffee spoons to form them into quenelles, then poach them in the consomme. 
Then prepare the truffles:  Poach them in consomme, then cut them an inch in diameter with a root slicer -- then cut them into scallops 2-inches thick. 
Then, serially, blanch the mushrooms, oysters, shrimp, and crayfish tails in consomme. 
Then clarify the broth of the soup, mixing together the broth, the fish stock, and all the consommes.  Bring to a boil. 
Presentation:  In a soup tureen, place the drained quenelles, the drained fish scallops, the truffles, mushrooms, oysters, shrimp, and crayfish.  When ready to serve, pour the boiling hot broth into the tureen and take to table.  Whew! 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
(Creation of the great French Chef Marie Antoine Careme, 1784-1833) 
Comments:  This artist, Marie Antoine Careme, was chef to Talleyrand, Tsar Alexander I, George IV, and Baron Rothschild.  He lived and continues to live in an entirely different dimension from you and me and this soup collection.  Nevertheless, for the record, here is one of his simplest creations.  He says, "I served it for the first time at Boulogne, near Paris, in the household of Monsieur le Baron de Rothschild, the very day that I had the honor of being presented to the celebrated Lady Morgan."    It's the only soup on this site that I have not personally made.  Maybe one of these days I'll find the time, the money, and the nerve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh cooked lobster
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped combination of onion,
                        carrot, and fennel (or celery)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz)
  1                cup  dry vermouth
  1                     bay leaf
  1                     garlic clove -- mashed
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        === LOBSTER CREAM ===
     1/2                lobster tail
  1         tablespoon  vermouth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Heavy cream

First an anatomy lesson.  Put your lobster flat on its back on a plate (to catch the juices).  Take a pair of scissors and cut from the bottom of the tail straight up its top shell, through the body, to the center of the head (but not through the eyes).  Turn the lobster over, and cut the same way through the other side of the shell.  Now you should be able to easily sever the lobster completely up through the middle, except still attached at the head. 
Break the shell apart at the head to open it up.  You'll see the stomach sack -- on one side or the other -- right under the eyes (it's about an inch long) -- twist it out with your fingers and throw it away.  Also pull out the long intestinal vein that goes down the length of the lobster from the sac to the tail.  Throw it away too. 
Now to work:  Scoop the green tomalley in the chest into a small bowl.  You will want to cream this with soft butter later on to serve with the bread.  If you have a female lobster (she'll have hairy paddles under the legs instead of the pointy sticks), you may find orangey roe -- just add this to the tomalley, or keep separate for its own butter. 
Dismember the lobster -- separating claws, joints, legs, chest halves, and tail halves.  Cut the meat away from the tail, the joints, and the claws and set aside.  Save the shells. 
Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the finely chopped vegetables (mirepoix).  Cook slowly for 6 to 8 minutes (don't brown). 
In the meantime, film the bottom of a Dutch oven with oil, heat to medium-high, then add the lobster shells.  Toss for about 4 minutes, then reduce heat.  Salt and pepper the shells, turn again, then pour in the lobster juice, the wine, the chopped tomatoes with their juice, the bay leaf, the garlic, the cayenne, and the sauteed vegetables.  Cover the pot and simmer at low heat for 30 minutes. 
Remove the shells and bay leaf and puree soup.  Return to pot, and add the lobster meat, cut into big pieces, from half the tail (save the other half for the garnish!), the joints, and the claws.  Season to taste, then simmer gently while preparing the lobster cream. 
Cut away any red markings on the reserved meat from the half tail.  Mince the white meat finely, then puree with vermouth, salt and pepper, and enough cream that your lobster cream is pureed and a thick sauce consistency. 
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into flat soup plates and swirl the white cream in the middle.  Slice with a knife through the cream in a few directions to create an abstract design.  Voila.  Serve with crusty bread slathered with that heavenly tomalley butter.... 
Comments:  When there's nothing too good for your baby, this may be just the labor of love you're looking for.  Mightily extravagant, a pain to make, and definitely worth it.  Serve this red and white Valentine Special, bubbly hot, to 2 -- with crusty bread and champagne, preferably by candlelight.

Comments:  When there&apos;s nothing too good for your baby, this may be just the labor of love you&apos;re looking for.  Mightily extravagant, a pain to make, and definitely worth it.  Serve this red and white Valentine Special, bubbly hot, to 2 -- with crusty bread and champagne, preferably by candlelight.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped into
                        bite-sized chunks
     1/4         pound  dark-gilled mushrooms -- quartered
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3               cups  fish stock
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz) -- seeded, chopped
  1                     zucchini -- cut into eighths,
                        and cut into bite-sized chunks
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  rosemary -- crushed to powder
     1/4      teaspoon  oregano -- crushed to powder
  1              pinch  hot pepper flakes
  1               pint  standard oysters
                        Chopped fresh parsley

In a large saucepan, saute the onions and mushrooms over a high heat, until the onions are golden and the mushrooms are brown.  Add garlic and stir for a minute. 
Add fish stock, chopped tomatoes and the juice reserved from the can of tomatoes.  Stir in the bay leaf, rosemary, oregano, and hot peppers.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. 
Add the zucchini chunks, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes, until the zucchini is almost tender.  Then slip the oysters with their liquid into the soup and cook, uncovered, just until their edges begin to curl.  You want them tender, not chewy. 
Ladle immediately into bowls.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.  Fat, dense oyster biscuits taste awfully good with this soup. 
Comments:  This spicy and chunky chowder is just the thing for a warming lunch or a light dinner with lots of side dishes; serve hot to 6.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bacon strips - (to 3)
  1              large  onion -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  wine
                        (either a red Burgundy/Cote du Rhone or a
                        dry white Cote du Rhone/French vermouth)
  2               cups  fish stock or clam juice
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  allspice
  1              pound  small mushrooms -- or cut mouthful
                        size
  20             small  boiling onions -- unpeeled, and
                        with crosses cut into their roots
  2             pounds  freshwater fish -- cut in slabs
                        (preferably eel, but perch or trout
                        or catfish is great) -- see * Note
                        === GARNISH ===
                        White bread triangles -- freshly sauteed in
                        Butter

* Note:  Traditionally the slabs include skin and bones, but it's a lot easier to eat fillets.  In fact, the popular "catfish nuggets" you find in the market are hard to beat. 
Fry the bacon in a large saucepan.  When crisp, remove the bacon and reserve.  Add the onion and garlic to the bacon grease and saute until tender.  Pour in the wine and the stock, add the parsley, thyme, bay leaf, pepper, and allspice, bring to a simmer and let it cook for 30 to 45 minutes. 
While the soup is simmering, prepare the remaining additions.  First, put the little onions into a pan of boiling water and cook them for a few minutes.  Drain -- the peels will come off easily. 
Melt a couple tablespoons of butter over a medium-high heat in the same pan (water poured out), then add the mushrooms and toss until they are nicely browned.  Remove them to a bowl. 
Add more butter to the pan and throw in the peeled onions, tossing them until they are patchy brown.  Add them to the mushrooms.  Deglaze the pan with water and pour all that brown goodness into the simmering broth. 
When 15 minutes away from serving, bring the soup to a boil and add the fish.  Let it boil slowly for 8 to 10 minutes, until the fish is just done, then remove the fish to a serving tureen and keep warm. 
Scrape the onions and mushrooms into the broth, turn to a high heat, and boil hard for 5 minutes to reduce the soup and concentrate its flavors.  Pour over the soup, garnish with the buttery canapes, and serve immediately. 
Comments:  This classic French fish chowder is not as well known as Bouillabaisse, but it is wonderful -- often known as the fisherman's coq au vin.  Coming from an inland region of France, it traditionally uses eel or other fresh fish -- and either red or white wine.  Cognoscenti quibble over names and ingredients, as if soup has the rigid requirements of puff pastry.  I say, enjoy whatever version appeals to you -- and serve it as a meal to 4 to 6 lucky people, with boiled potatoes, salad, and French bread on the side.

              Mexican Albondigas Soup - {Caldo De Albondiga}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     onions -- finely diced
  3        tablespoons  bacon grease
  2               cans  tomatoes - (16 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  roasted green chile peppers
                        (or one 4 oz can chopped green chiles)
  3             quarts  weak beef stock -- (if you're making
                        a meal, reduce the amount to 2 quarts)
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
  1            handful  cilantro -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     corn tortillas -- sliced into tiny,
                        short slivers
  1              pound  extra-lean ground beef
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
  1                     egg
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Warmed flour tortillas -- cut into strips
                        Lime slices

In a large soup pot, saute the onions in bacon grease.  Cut the tomatoes into the pot, reserving their juice, and cook down for 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the reserved tomato juice, stock, green chiles, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and cilantro.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
While the soup is simmering, make the albondigas:  Mix the ground beef, egg, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, salt, and pepper.  Shape into tiny (marble-sized) balls. 
When ready to serve, carefully drop the albondigas into the simmering soup.  When they float, turn the heat off, cover the pot, and hold for 10 minutes (unless you like your garlic really strong -- in which case, serve immediately!). 
If you are serving a meal, put a big spoonful of Spanish rice in each bowl first.  Otherwise, ladle the soup into bowls, garnishing with fine strips of warmed flour tortillas topped by a fresh cut lime round. 
Serve hot to 8 to 10 as a substantial first course.  Serve hot to 4 to 6 over a big spoonful of Spanish rice (with lots of salad and tortillas on the side) for lunch or dinner. 
Comments:  This superb and superbly flavored Mexican soup -- contributed by Margaret Pacillas of El Paso, Texas -- can be a wonderful start to a meal -- or a completely satisfying meal in itself.

<DirT>
In a large soup pot, saute the onions in bacon grease.  Cut the tomatoes into the pot, reserving their juice, and cook down for 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the reserved tomato juice, stock, green chiles, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and cilantro.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the soup is simmering, make the albondigas:  Mix the ground beef, egg, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, salt, and pepper.  Shape into tiny (marble-sized) balls. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, carefully drop the albondigas into the simmering soup.  When they float, turn the heat off, cover the pot, and hold for 10 minutes (unless you like your garlic really strong -- in which case, serve immediately!). 
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you are serving a meal, put a big spoonful of Spanish rice in each bowl first.  Otherwise, ladle the soup into bowls, garnishing with fine strips of warmed flour tortillas topped by a fresh cut lime round. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot to 8 to 10 as a substantial first course.  Serve hot to 4 to 6 over a big spoonful of Spanish rice (with lots of salad and tortillas on the side) for lunch or dinner. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This superb and superbly flavored Mexican soup -- contributed by Margaret Pacillas of El Paso, Texas -- can be a wonderful start to a meal -- or a completely satisfying meal in itself.

                Mexican Avocado Soup - {Sopa De Aguacate}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                     chili pepper -- hot as you dare
                        (from banana to habanero)
  1                     garlic clove
  2                     avocados
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Finely chopped cilantro
                        Crisp tortillas -- fried in lard
                        or oil

Heat the stock and cream and keep at a simmer.  Puree the chili pepper and garlic in a blender, then add avocado.  When ready to serve, gradually add the hot stock mixture and blend until smooth. 
Season to taste and either serve immediately with cilantro topping and tortilla chips on the side -- or refrigerate immediately to make a cold soup.  Avocados turn bitter when heated, so be careful. 
Comments:  This rich soup is both simple and seductive -- in a word, irresistible.  Serve hot or cold to 6 as a filling first course.

             Mexican Lime Soup With Chicken - {Sopa De Lima}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  lard or corn oil
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  3             medium  tomatoes -- peeled, chopped
                        (or one 14-oz can tomatoes)
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2                     canned serrano chilies - (to 3) -- chopped
  6               cups  chicken stock
                        Juice of 1/2 lime and its shell
  1                     chicken breast -- boned and skinned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  6                     tortillas -- cut thin strips,
                        and fried crisp
  1                     lime -- sliced decoratively

In a large saucepan, heat the lard or oil, then saute the onion until soft.  Add the green pepper and stir for a minute, then add the tomato and, turning up the heat, cook down for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the serrano chilies, the stock, the lime juice, and the lime shell -- bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. 
At that time, halve the chicken breast, pound down, and put into the soup to simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, until tender.  (If you decide to go traditional, simmer the gizzard beforehand in salted water for about 30 minutes -- then trim and slice and add to the soup with the chopped livers, which you'll simmer from 5 to 10 minutes.) 
While the soup is simmering, heat lard or oil in a skillet to a depth of about 1/4 inch.  When hot, saute the tortilla strips in batches, flipping until they are crisp, then draining on paper towels.  Also, cut 6 little decorative slices of lime from the remaining lime. 
When the chicken is done, remove it and slice into fine strips.  Return to the soup and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
When ready to serve the soup, ladle into flat soup bowls.  Squeeze fresh lime into each bowl, top with crispy tortillas, and put the little reserved lime slices on the flat rims of the bowls.  Serve hot immediately. 
Serve hot to 6 as a substantial first course -- or to 4 as lunch. 
Comments:  This is a nontraditional recipe of a traditional Yucatan (that is to say, Mayan) soup.  It's wonderful -- heady, light, but filling.  Not spicy hot at all, either -- just perfectly tangy and piquant.  To go traditional, substitute 3 chicken gizzards and 6 chopped chicken livers for the chicken breast.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  bacon
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped celery and leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  flour
  2               cups  fish stock
  2             medium  potatoes -- diced
  1           teaspoon  seafood seasoning
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2               cans  chopped clams - (6 1/2 oz ea)

Fry bacon in a large saucepan.  When it's crisp, take out the bacon.  Put the onion and celery into the bacon crease and saute until it's translucent.  Stir in the flour, then pour in the fish stock and stir until it's thickened. 
Dump in the potatoes and seafood seasoning, bring to a boil, cover, turn down the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Add the milk, cream, clams, and clam liquid, then take it off the fire until you're ready to serve it. 
When it's time to eat, heat through, ladle into big bowls, and crumble the bacon on top. 
Comments:  It's definitely soup as a meal and decidedly New England, USA.  Serve hot to 4 people. 
SoupTale:  "A New England clam chowder, made as it should be, is a dish to preach about, to chant praises and sing hymns and burn incense before.  To fight for.  The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought for -- or on -- clam chowder; part of it at least, I am sure it was.  It is as American as the Stars and Stripes, as patriotic as the national Anthem.  It is 'Yankee Doodle in a kettle.'"--Joseph C. Lincoln 
Soup Tale:  "'Queequeg, said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?'  However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh sweet friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole poached with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt."--Herman Melville, Moby Dick

Fry bacon in a large saucepan.  When it&apos;s crisp, take out the bacon.  Put the onion and celery into the bacon crease and saute until it&apos;s translucent.  Stir in the flour, then pour in the fish stock and stir until it&apos;s thickened.

Dump in the potatoes and seafood seasoning, bring to a boil, cover, turn down the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Add the milk, cream, clams, and clam liquid, then take it off the fire until you&apos;re ready to serve it.

Comments:  It&apos;s definitely soup as a meal and decidedly New England, USA.  Serve hot to 4 people. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
SoupTale:  &quot;A New England clam chowder, made as it should be, is a dish to preach about, to chant praises and sing hymns and burn incense before.  To fight for.  The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought for -- or on -- clam chowder; part of it at least, I am sure it was.  It is as American as the Stars and Stripes, as patriotic as the national Anthem.  It is &apos;Yankee Doodle in a kettle.&apos;&quot;--Joseph C. Lincoln 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Soup Tale:  &quot;&apos;Queequeg, said I, &quot;do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?&apos;  However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh sweet friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole poached with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.&quot;--Herman Melville, Moby Dick

           Norman Apple And Potato Soup - {La Pommeraie GlacÈe}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     leeks (white part) -- cleaned, sliced
  5               cups  chopped peeled cored apples -- (tart ones, like
                        Granny Smith, are best)
  6               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  chopped peeled potatoes
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  Calvados (or apple brandy)
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     apples -- peeled, cored,
                        diced, and sauteed in
  2        tablespoons  butter -- for 5 minutes,
                        then drained on paper towels

Saute the leeks in the 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Toss in the apples and cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes -- coating them well with the butter.  Pour in the stock, add the potatoes, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes. 
When the apples and potato are soft, puree in a blender -- solids first -- until smooth.  Return to the saucepan, then stir in heavy cream, Calvados, and cinnamon.  Season to taste. 
Refrigerate if you are going to serve cold -- in which case you will want to overseason a bit.  Saute the apple dice garnish in 2 tablespoons of butter, then let drain on paper towels until you are ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, ladle into soup bowls (reheat first, if you are serving hot) and top with the apple dice garnish. 
Comments:  Strangely delicate and not really sweet at all, this chilled soup from Normandy, France, is a marvelous first course to an autumn meal of roast duck or chicken with roasted root vegetables on the side.  Serve chilled -- or hot -- to 4 to 6 people.

                          Nutted Wild Rice Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  uncooked wild rice
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  walnuts -- coarsely chopped
                        (can also use pecans)
  4        tablespoons  chopped green onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  8               cups  chicken or turkey stock
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     2/3           cup  fresh cranberries -- chopped
  2               cups  bite-sized cooked chicken or turkey chunks
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  3        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  sherry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Minced celery leaves or parsley
                        Sherry

Begin by rinsing the wild rice in hot water, then draining well.  Then, in a Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat and toss in the walnuts (or pecans) when it is sizzling.  SautÈ until crispy, about 5 minutes, then remove the nuts and reserve them. 
In the same butter, stir in the wild rice, green onions, and garlic, and fry over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, until the wild rice is toasted.  Pour in the chicken stock; stir in the tomato paste; and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. 
Stir in the cranberries, reserved walnuts, and meat chunks and continue to simmer for 15 to 20 more minutes.  Finally, increase the heat to medium-high, and stir in the cornstarch liquid and the sherry to thicken.  Season to taste. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with minced celery leaves or parsley.  Dribble a spoonful of sherry over each portion before taking the plates to the table. 
Serve hot as a meal to 4 to 6 people 
Comments:  Deeply woodsy and autumnal in richness, this soup is a wonderful meal in itself, with the crunch of toasted walnuts, the sweet-tart of cranberries, and the chewy bite of wild rice.  This is surely one way to use up the Thanksgiving turkey that won't remotely resemble leftovers -- a true salute to New World Foods.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  water
  1                     veal or beef bone
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     dry whole red chili pepper
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2              whole  onions
  2             pounds  honeycomb tripe -- well washed,
                        (can also blanch tripe)
  4                     potatoes -- diced
  1           teaspoon  marjoram
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter or lard
  1                cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk

Bring water, bay leaves, chili pepper, and salt to a boil.  Add the tripe, then immediately reduce heat.  Simmer for at least 2 and 1/2 hours. 
Remove the veal bone, bay leaves, pepper, and onion.  Take out the tripe, then slice into paper-thin strips and mince crosswise.  Skim the fat off the top of the stock and return the tripe to the pot with the diced potatoes.  Thin with boiling water so it's nicely soupy.  Allow to simmer until you're ready to serve -- hours, if possible, as you want the tripe to be as tender as possible. 
When ready to serve, rub the marjoram into the pot between the heels of your hands.  Bring soup to a good simmer, then drop in dumplings and cook until they are done.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately with a cruet of cider vinegar on the table for final flavoring. 
To make dumplings: Cut butter or lard into flour, baking powder, and salt.  Then stir in milk gradually.  Flour hands -- and roll dough into small balls. 
Serve hot as a slender meal to 4 people. 
Comments:  Here's another "memory lane" soup -- traditional in hometown Philadelphia -- as evocative as, yo, a madeleine any old day.  In my family -- and my great grandmother was the queen of pepper pot -- cognoscenti insisted on a sprinkle of cider vinegar at the table.

                        vegetable stock is fine)
     2/3           cup  creamy peanut butter
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Dribbles of heavy cream
                        Finely-minced celery leaves
                        Finely-crushed peanuts

Saute onion and celery in the butter until soft, but not brown.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so.  Stir in the stock a little at a time, whisking, then bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Puree, solids first, then whisk in peanut butter and cream until the soup is smooth. 
When ready to serve, reheat (don't let boil), then ladle into small bowls.  Dribble a half-teaspoonful of cream in a pretty pattern, then sprinkle with minced celery leaves and finely crushed peanuts.  Serve immediately. 
Serve hot as a first course to 6. 
Comments:  A rich yet delicate beginning to an elegant meal, this creamy American classic should be served in small bowls with a special garnish.  I recommend a tiny dribbling of cream topped with finely minced celery leaves and finely crushed peanuts.

                  Oyster Cream Soup With Lemony Carrots

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  carrots -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              bunch  green onions -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  4                     canned tomatoes (or 2 fresh) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1           teaspoon  chopped basil (or pesto)
  1           teaspoon  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  5               cups  milk
  1                cup  whipping cream

Boil the carrots until tender.  Drain, slice thinly and mix with lemon juice and oil.  Refrigerate. 
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add onions and garlic and cook until translucent  -- about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, increase heat, and cook until thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the basil and thyme, salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste.  Cook until all the moisture has evaporated, then puree in a blender or food processor.  At this point, you can refrigerate until ready to serve.  Overnight just makes it better. 
When ready to eat, stir the onion mixture into a saucepan with the milk and cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, adjust seasoning, and add the carrots with marinade.  Add the whole jar of oysters, liquid and all, and poach until just opaque -- about 2 minutes. 
Ladle into flat soup bowls and garnish with the basil leaves -- or swirl a teaspoon of pesto through each bowl. 
Comments:  A thick, tangy soup to serve as a warming lunch or light supper with lots of bread and salad; serve hot to 6 people.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  fish stock
  2                     potatoes -- cut fine julienne
  2                     carrots -- cut fine julienne
     1/2                jalapeÒo pepper - (to 1) -- cut fine slivers
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
  1               pint  standard oysters
                        Juice of 1 lemon - (2 to 3 tbspns)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Paper-thin rounds of lemon -- sprinkled with
                        Thyme

Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan.  Add potatoes, carrots, jalapeÒo slivers, lemon zest, thyme, salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce heat, leave uncovered and simmer until the vegetables are tender -- about 15 minutes. 
Slip the oysters with their liquid into the simmering stock and cook just until their edges curl -- about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice, and adjust for seasoning.  Ladle into bowls, top each with a lemon slice and sprinkling of thyme.  Serve immediately. 
Comments:  So clean and piquant, you'll think you've been to the beach; serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a stimulating first course.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- thickly sliced
  2                     carrots -- thickly sliced
                        on a diagonal
  1                     red pepper, hot or sweet -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  smoked ham -- cut into julienne
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        (or 1 tbspn basil pesto)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  mint
  1                can  tomatoes - (15 oz)
  6               cups  chicken stock
  2               cans  dark red kidney beans - (16 oz ea)
  2 1/2           cups  small rotelle pasta
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  mushrooms
     1/4           cup  shredded basil leaves
                        (or parsley, if you can't get fresh basil)
                        === GARNISH ===
  1              bunch  green onions -- sliced thinly
                        on the diagonal
                        olive oil
                        Grated Parmesan cheese

In a large saucepan, fry the onions, carrots, and peppers in the oil over medium heat -- until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the ham, basil or pesto, garlic, oregano, and mint.  Stir for a few minutes, then add the drained tomatoes (reserving juice).  Cook at a fairly high heat, stirring, until the mixture is a thick sauce, crushing the tomatoes with the spoon as they cook.  This always takes longer than you think -- as much as 10 minutes. 
Add the reserved tomato juice, stock, and kidney beans, with or without their sauce, your choice.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.  At this point, you can refrigerate until you are ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, degrease the soup and return it to a boil.  Add the pasta and boil gently until it is al dente -- about 6 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the mushrooms, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Then stir in the shredded basil or parsley, ladle into bowls, garnish with the green onions and a drizzle of olive oil.  Pass the Parmesan separately. 
Comments:  This is a slightly nontraditional version of the classic Italian soup -- just as good but more visually resplendent.  Serve hot as an "i primi" to 6.

                       Potage Parmentier - {French}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  sliced leeks, white, tender green parts
  3        tablespoons  butter -- (optional)
  4               cups  potatoes -- peeled and chopped
  8               cups  water or chicken stock -- (chicken stock is
                        not orginal, but enriches it)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        Chopped parsley or chives -- for garnish

Although not original to the recipe, the soup is enriched by sautÈeing the leeks in 3 tablespoons of butter as a first step. 
In a Dutch oven, simmer the potatoes, leeks, and salt in the water until all are very tender -- about 50 minutes.  Puree the mixture, then correct seasoning. 
When ready to serve, stir in the cream, ladle into bowls or a tureen, and decorate with herbs. 
Comments:  This excellent French soup is as smooth and elegant as it is simple; serve hot to 6 to 8 people as a first course. 
Soup Tale:  France was beset with famine following the Seven Year War (1756-1763).  Native son Antoine Auguste Parmentier, who had been fed the so-called poisonous potato root in a German prison-of-war camp, returned to France to find his country men starving.  He set up potato soup kitchens throughout Paris to assist the poor.  Ultimately, Louis XVI recognized his work by saying, "France will thank you some day for having found bread for the poor."  In fact, he is best honored by the pleasure his country takes in digesting Potage Parmentier.

                      Ronald Reagan's Hamburger Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lean ground beef
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  diced onions
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  sliced carrots
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  10            ounces  [canned] hominy
  1                cup  diced green peppers
  3             quarts  [12 cups] beef broth
                        or water with bouillon cubes
  16            ounces  chopped tomato [canned or fresh]
  2               cups  sliced celery

Step 1:  Brown meat in butter in six-quart sauce pan.  Add onions, garlic, carrots, celery and green pepper.  Simmer 10 minutes with the pan covered. 
Step 2:  Add beef broth or water with bouillon cubes.  Add chopped tomato and pepper.  Simmer soup on low heat for 35 minutes.  Add hominy.  Boil hamburger soup for 10 minutes more. 
Makes 4 quarts. 
Comments:  There's been speculation that this first made news after President Reagan innocently announced his liking for fancy French soups...and was immediately accused of being elitist.  Whatever.  It's definitely a homespun, plain soup, and not as bad as you might think when you see that there's hominy in it.  This corn product -- with an Algonquin Native American name -- was an important food to early U.S. pioneers.  It's a nice firm little ball in the soup -- almost dumpling like.  Serve the soup as a lunch meal to 4 to 6 people with lots of cornbread, cold milk, and maybe a big American pie for dessert.  Above is the recipe verbatim (as sent out over the PR Newswire, March 11, 1986) -- note the non-elitist allowance for canned foods and bouillon cubes.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
  5                     red onions -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  flour
  2        tablespoons  Arborio rice
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  8               cups  light vegetable stock
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  8             slices  Italian bread -- toasted
                        Gorgonzola cheese -- mixed with
                        Butter -- to taste

For the garnish:  Toast the bread until dry; spread with gorgonzola cheese-butter mixture; set aside. 
Saute onions in butter for about 20 minutes, until the onions are soft.  Stir in rice to coat it, then stir in flour and cook for a minute or two.  Add the wine, some salt and pepper, and stir until thickened.  Pour in hot stock and whisk until mixed.  Reduce heat and simmer for an hour. 
When ready to serve, whisk egg yolk with the cream and stir into the simmering soup.  Continue stirring for a couple minutes, as the soup enriches. 
Adjust for seasoning.  Ladle into bowls, top with gorgonzola toast, and run under the broiler just for a minute.  Serve immediately. 
Comments:  A lush, extravagant northern Italian soup, with a hint of pink; serve hot as a luncheon meal, with lots of bread and salad, to 8 people.

                        Tarragon (or other fresh herb)
                        Cro˚tons (made from thin slices of
                        bread fried in butter until crisp and
                        brown)

In a skillet, sautÈ the onion, celery, and carrot (called a mirepoix) in the butter for 5 minutes, until the vegetable are soft, not brown.  Add the tomato pieces and sautÈ for another 5 minutes.  Scrape out into a bowl and reserve. 
In the same pan, heat the olive oil then add the whole shrimp.  Cook until the shells are red and crisp -- about 4 to 5 minutes.  Scrape out of the pan and let cool. 
While the shrimp are cooling, heat the stock and wine in a large saucepan, add the reserved vegetables and the rice, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and, partially covered, simmer for 20 minutes. 
Peel the cooled shrimp, separating the shells and the meat, and toss the shells into the cooking soup. 
When the soup has finished cooking, puree in a blender, solids first (including the shells), then strain back into the pot. 
Take half of the reserved shrimp, puree them in the blender (slowly adding enough hot stock to completely emulsify them) -- and pour them into the pot. 
Enrich the soup by whisking in the softened butter and the cream, then season to taste with salt and pepper.  Let sit, for flavors to blend, until ready to serve. 
When ready to serve, sautÈ thin bread slices in butter until crisp and brown, then drain.  Slice the remaining shrimp lengthwise and briefly sautÈ them over high heat with the Cognac or wine. 
Mince the tarragon or other herb finely.  Ladle the soup into bowls, top with the shrimp and minced herb, and pass the cro˚tons separately. 
Serve hot to 4 to 6. 
Comments:  Traditionally, shrimp bisque is a waterfront or restaurant soup -- springing from some place that accumulates the masses of shrimp shells that are needed to make the distinctive shrimp-shell stock.  Times change, though.  Now it's possible to buy concentrated shrimp base.  And even without that, you can come awfully close to the original by incorporating some shrimp shells into a seafood or fish stock.  This recipe produces a shrimp bisque that is deeply flavored of shrimp and the salt sea.  It's thick and tangy, wonderfully satsifying as lunch with a salad or sandwich...or as an elegant first course to dinner.

           South-Of-The-Mason-Dixon-Line Crab Soup - {American}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  picked crabmeat
                        (backfin -- why not?! - you can
                        use canned lump if you like)
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 lb)
     1/3           cup  minced shallots
  1              small  onion -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped hot red chili pepper
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  fish and/or chicken stock
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Dry sherry
                        Paprika

Saute the shallots, onion, and chili pepper in the butter over low heat in a large soup pot.  When the onions are transparent, stir in the flour and continue stirring, over medium heat, for about 2 minutes.  Be careful not to brown the flour. 
Take off the heat and whisk in the cream and stock.  Return to heat and stir until thickened.  Stir in the crab gently (you don't want to break it up), then season with salt and pepper and Worcestershire sauce.  Cook at a very low heat for 20 to 25 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, stir a spoonful of sherry into each, and sprinkle with paprika. 
Serve hot as an elegant first course to 4 to 6 people. 
Comments:  Absolutely, outrageously rich -- an unabashed decadent in the land of soup.  Perfect for those days when you've just got to be bad.  It was contributed by Amy Halsted, partner in Rivermyst Fly Fishing, which specializes in fly fishing for women and families, and owner/creative director of The Halsted Agency, a marketing communications firm specializing in outdoor industries.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  shredded cooked chicken
  1                cup  cooked rice
  1                cup  canned chickpeas -- no juice
  1                     chipotle pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped -- see * Note
  1              pinch  oregano
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  grated Monteray Jack cheese
  1                     avocado -- pitted, peeled,
                        and chopped

* Note:  It's easiest to get the smoked jalapeÒos in cans, then wash off the sauce they're in. 
Heat the stock in a large saucepan, then stir in the chicken, rice, chickpeas, chipotle pepper, and oregano.  Let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until all ingredients are heated through. 
To serve, ladle into bowls and top with cheese and avocado. 
Serve hot to 2 as a meal -- or to 4 as a first course. 
Comments:  According to grandaughter Leona Wood, Josepha Carson, wife of Kit Carson, was mad for this soup.  And no wonder.  It's smoky, piquant, filling, beautiful to look at -- and an explosion of textures on the tongue.

                   Spanish Garlic Soup - {Anna's Soup}

Recipe By     :Anna Trombley
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  chicken stock
  3               cups  good bread -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              whole  garlic head -- peeled, minced
                        Salt -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  4                     eggs

* Note:   A hearty 7-grain is good, also French or sourdough, roughly diced and food processed into uneven pieces no bigger than 1/2-inch square. 
Heat the stock in a large saucepan and keep ready.  In a frying pan, heat the olive oil, then toss in the bread crumbs and stir until browned.  Stir in the paprika and garlic, and saute a little longer, until the garlic aroma is released.  Scrape into the simmering stock, washing out the pan with stock to get every bit of flavor.  Simmer for 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, salt to taste, bring to a medium simmer, and break the eggs into the soup at the point you can see bubbles break the surface.  Let poach until done, then ladle into soup bowls and serve extra bread on the side.  I used flattish black pottery bowls and thought it one of the most appetizing soups I'd ever seen.  Anna says, "good reheated, with more eggs thrown in." 
Serve hot to 4 people as a main course. 
Comments:  Recipe contributed by Anna Trombley in Olympia, Washington.  By contrast to the lean fare of Santayana's family (see Spanish Garlic Soup - {Santayana's Soup}), hers is a thing of beauty, with toasted chunks of garlicky bread lightened in a paprika-red broth and set off by a poached egg that adds richness and textural contrast.  Anna -- who plays and dances with a Samba percussion group and who generally approaches life with artistic zest -- says, it ain't pretty, but it hits the spot and warms the heart, especially on cold, dark, windy Pacific Northwest nights."

Recipe By     :George Santayana
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic heads -- separated, peeled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6               cups  hot water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        French bread in thin little slices
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  4                     eggs
  4             slices  cheese - "cut so thin that the children
                        would hold it up to the light, to admire
                        its transparency, and wink at one
                        another through the frequent round holes"

Fry the garlic cloves in olive oil in a medium saucepan until crisp.  Remove the larger pieces of garlic.  Add hot water, thin slices of bread, and a little salt.  Ladle into 4 bowls.  If you are feeling rich, break a raw egg into each bowl.  Serve, as you can, with more bread and cheese. 
Comments:  This hot Spanish soup seems especially filling for 4 people when you know the story behind it, told by American philosopher George Santayana about his father and his heritage. 
"The Spanish dignity in humility was most marked in my father.  He lived when necessary and almost by preference like the poor, without the least comfort, variety, or entertainment.  He was bred in poverty, not the standard poverty, so to speak, of the hereditary working classes, but in the cramped genteel poverty of those who find themselves poorer than they were, or than they have to seem.  He was one of twelve children, imposing the strictest economy in the household of a minor official, with insecure tenure of office, such as his father was.  For supper they had each a bowl of garlic soup -- something that my father loved in his old age, and that I also liked, especially if I might break a raw egg into it, as those twelve children were certainly never allowed to do."  -- George Santayana, "Persons & Places: The Background of My Life"

                        Stracciatelle - {Italian}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  soft bread crumbs or farina
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  1              piece  basil, parsley, or crossed chives -- just for looks
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan -- on the side

Bring the stock to simmer in a saucepan.  Then, in a separate bowl, beat the egg with a fork and continue beating as you add the cheese and bread crumbs -- and finally, a half cup of the simmering stock. 
Bring the remaining stock to nearly a boil, scrape in the egg mixture, and whisk it feelingly, even emotionally, with a fork for 3 to 4 minutes.  When you stop beating, let the soup come just barely to a boil -- its creaminess will then break into plump, lacy custards. 
Serve immediately, with an extra sprinkling of Parmesan topped by a single piece of herb.  Sit down with it.  Breathe it in deeply.  Fast forward to Rigoletto's last aria over the body of Gilda.  I definitely think you deserve some good Italian bread, a couple olives, and a glass of wine too. 
Comments:  So you're feeling fat...or blue...or just plain beat; in a word, feeling sorry for yourself.  This is the soup for you -- fast, comforting, stomach calming.  If you turn up the Verdi, all will be right with the world.  Serve this traditional Italian soup hot to yourself and maybe one other soulmate.

                           Superbowl Chili Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground beef
  2                     onions -- cut in chunks
  1                     green pepper -- cut bite-size
  1                     red pepper -- cut bite-size
                        hot chili peppers -- chopped, to taste
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  tomatoes - (29 oz) -- cut up,
                        reserving their juice
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  6               cups  beef stock
  4        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2               cans  black beans - (15 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
                        (thus reducing the explosive side
                        effects)
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped fresh cilantro
                        Grated white Cheddar cheese

Brown the beef in a large saucepan until oil forms in the pan.  Toss in the onions, garlic, and all the peppers and sautÈ until soft.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes (reserving juice) and let them cook down over medium heat for about 10 minutes. 
Stir in the vinegar, and let it cook down.  Pour in the reserved tomato juice, the beef stock, and the tomato paste.  Bring to a boil.  Add the beans and let boil for several minutes. 
Reduce the heat, stir in the chili powder and cumin, partially cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with grated cheese and chopped cilantro.  Pass a bowl of tortilla chips while you're at it. 
Serve hot with tortilla chips to 8 stalwart fans. 
Comments:  No matter where you're watching the game, and no matter how many snacks and munchies are laying around, there's just nothing like the taste of chili to pep up the plays.  This recipe is especially nice because, as a soup, it's not as filling as a pure chili con carne, but it's wonderfully authentic...creating a perfect small sweat on the back of your head.  Just what this year's fans in freezing Atlanta need.

           Thai Coconut Pumpkin Soup - {Gaeng Liang Fak Thong}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/4           cup  dried shrimp -- soaked 5 minutes in
                        boiling water, squeezed, and
                        chopped fine
  1                     red chile pepper -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                     green chile pepper -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  shrimp paste - (Kapi)
  6               cups  water
  2               cups  fresh pumpkin or other winter squash -- cut 1" squares,
                        then cut again into triangles
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz) -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Chopped cilantro
  6                     slivered fresh basil leaves -- if available

* Note:  Can also mix up 2 cups of coconut milk from the instant powder that's sold in oriental markets. 
In a soup pot, saute the onion until golden brown.  Stir in the dried shrimp, chiles, and shrimp paste and fry for a minute.  Add water and bring to a boil.  Add pumpkin triangles, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.  Salt to taste. 
When ready to serve, pour in coconut milk and bring just to a simmer (more and the coconut taste will decay).  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with lemon juice, then with cilantro.  Top each with a slivered basil leaf. 
Serve hot as a first course to 6 people. 
Comments:  Not your ordinary soup right out of the refrigerator -- in fact, you'll need a local Oriental market to find the shrimp paste and dried shrimp.  But what an appetite stimulant -- your taste buds will spend the rest of the night thinking about this complexity of flavors.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     shallots -- minced
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce -- (sold as Nam Pla
                        or as the Vietnamese Nuoc Mam)
     1/2         pound  crabmeat
                        (shrimp can be substituted, or scallops)
  1                can  creamed corn - (16 oz)
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat, add garlic and shallots, and fry until fragrant.  Pour in chicken stock, fish sauce, crab (or other seafood), and creamed corn.  Stir to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let cook for a minute or two. 
Meantime, beat the egg with the salt, then drip into the soup, covering the surface -- leave for a bit, then gently stir, forming ribbons of egg in the soup liquid.  Season to taste with salt and fish sauce.  Stir in white pepper.  Then ladle into a bowls and top with a design of whole cilantro leaves. 
Serve hot to 4 people. 
Comments:  Practically a fast food, this is a subtle and satisfying soup -- appetite stimulating as a first course and nicely slaking and contrapuntal in a traditional Thai meal, where all the dishes are served together and at once.

           Thai Herbed Chicken And Coconut Soup - {Kai Tom Kha}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro stems
  2             stalks  lemongrass - (bottom 6"to 8" only) -- finely sliced
  3                     shallots -- sliced
  4        tablespoons  chopped peeled ginger root -- (galangal,
                        preferably -- if you can get it)
     1/2      teaspoon  white pepper
  2               cans  coconut milk - (13 1/2 oz ea) -- Chaokoh brand
     3/4         pound  skinless boned chicken breasts -- sliced into strips
  5        tablespoons  fish sauce - (Nam Pla or
                        Vietnamese Nuoc Mam)
  5        tablespoons  lime juice
                        === GARNISH ===
  5                     red chilies - (the little fiery
                        Tabasco-types)
  7                     Kaffir lime leaves -- shredded
                        (or 1/2 tspn grated lime zest)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro leaves

Put the garlic, cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, ginger, and pepper in a blender and process it into as much of a paste as you can. 
Open the cans of coconut milk and carefully spoon off the top half of thick milk into a large saucepan (leaving the thin milk behind).  Bring this thick milk to a boil, then add the spice paste and stir over high heat for about 5 minutes. 
Add the chicken strips and continue stirring for a couple minutes, until the chicken is no longer pink.  Add the rest of the coconut milk (the thin part on the bottom), bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for a minute or two. 
When ready to serve, stir in the lime juice and fish sauce and reheat.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with chilies, finely shredded Kaffir lime leaves (or zest), and cilantro. 
Comments:  I tell you, I made this out of spite -- it sounded so bizarre.  And while I was making it, my misgivings deepened.  And yet, it was SO GOOD.  Sour, intense, hot, and fragrant -- I kept dipping into the pot and eating another bowl until it was entirely gone.  Serve hot as a first course to 4 to 6 people to stimulate appetites -- or serve to 1 big pig like myself, after a hard day at work followed by a peevish evening over the stove.

             Thai Hot And Spicy Shrimp Soup - {Tom Yum Koong}

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shrimp with shells
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  5               cups  chicken stock
  2                     lemongrass stalks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cilantro stems
  2                     garlic cloves
  2                     fresh red chilies - (to 4) -- seeds removed
     1/2      teaspoon  lime zest
  4                     Kaffir lime leaves -- chopped
                        (or another 1/2 tspn lime zest,
                        if you can't find the lime leaves)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                can  straw mushrooms -- in pieces
  1         tablespoon  Nam pla - (or another Southeast Asia
                        fish sauce like Viet Nam's Nuoc mam)
                        Juice of 1 lime
  2                     fresh red chilies -- seeded, slivered
  12             whole  cilantro leaves

Peel shrimp, reserving shells, and both devein and continue slicing lengthwise, pounding flat -- then set aside. 
Heat oil in a large saucepan, then fry the shrimp shells in it until they turn pink.  Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil, then reduce and let simmer.  Cut the lemon grass stalks in pieces -- reserving the bottom 5 inches -- then bruise the pieces with a few heavy hits, then toss them into the soup. 
Cut the reserved lemon grass into thin pieces, then either toss into a blender or pound with the garlic, the cilantro stems, the chilies, and and lime zest and leaves, and white pepper.  Stir into the soup, bring to a boil, then reduce and simmer for 20 minutes. 
When the stock is done, pour through a sieve, return to the saucepan, and reheat.  When soup is at a boil, add shrimp and mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the shrimp are pink.  Reduce heat, add lime juice and fish sauce, and taste for seasoning. 
When ready to serve, stir in slivered chilies and cilantro leaves, then ladle into bowls. 
Serve to 4, all at once with rice and any number of other dishes.  In a way, it serves as a beverage to the whole meal, served, as it traditionally is, all together. 
Comments:  This Thai soup is wonderful -- hot and sour and piquant, an outstanding combination of rich, chewy shrimp -- slippery mushroom -- and the foresty green of just cooked cilantro fronds in a complex broth.

When the stock is done, pour through a sieve, return to the saucepan, and reheat.  When soup is at a boil, add shrimp and mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the shrimp are pink.  Reduce heat, add lime juice and fish sauce, and taste for seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, stir in slivered chilies and cilantro leaves, then ladle into bowls. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve to 4, all at once with rice and any number of other dishes.  In a way, it serves as a beverage to the whole meal, served, as it traditionally is, all together. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This Thai soup is wonderful -- hot and sour and piquant, an outstanding combination of rich, chewy shrimp -- slippery mushroom -- and the foresty green of just cooked cilantro fronds in a complex broth.

                        Thai Rice Soup - {Gao Tom}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  ground pork
     1/2           cup  cooked rice
  1         tablespoon  nam pla or other fish sauce
  2                     eggs
                        === GARNISH ===
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced fresh ginger root
  1         tablespoon  minced cilantro
     1/4           cup  minced green onions

In a saucepan, bring the stock to a boil and add the ground pork, stirring to break it up.  Stir in the cooked rice and the fish sauce.  Cook at a moderate heat for 10 minutes. 
When ready to serve, break a whole egg into each individual bowl.  Bring the soup to a boil and ladle over the egg yolks.  Garnish with ginger, cilantro, and green onions.  Let sit for a minute, to let the egg poach, then serve to your sick chicks. 
Serve this hot to 2 people to coax their appetites -- or double the recipe for a savory first course for 4 people. 
Comments:  This excellent "chicken soup" is especially nice for invalids, with its soft, digestible rice -- a barely coddled, protein-rich egg -- tender, ground pork bits -- and appetite-stimulating spices.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boned chicken breast halves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              pound  fresh tomatillos -- husks removed,
                        and chopped (or 2 cups chopped drained
                        canned tomatillos)
  2                     jalapeÒo peppers -- seeded, chopped
  4               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  minced cilantro
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sour cream
                        Cilantro leaves

Pound the chicken breasts lightly then saute over high heat in a large saucepan or Dutch oven in the oil until both sides are browned -- about 2 minutes a side.  Remove the chicken and reserve. 
Add the onions and garlic to the pan and saute until golden -- then add the tomatillos, jalapeÒos, and stock.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15 minutes. 
Puree, solids first, and taste for heat.  Return to pot and reheat.  Taste, and if it's not piquant enough, add some cayenne or pepper sauce until it suits you. 
Slice the chicken thinly, then shred to bite size and add to the soup.  When ready to serve, stir in the minced cilantro and ladle into bowls.  Put a dollop of sour cream on each portion, let it melt a bit, then give it a swirl, top each with a single cilantro leaf and serve immediately. 
Serve hot to 6 as a first course. 
Comments:  This Tex-Mex soup is light, piquant, and wonderfully sour -- and an extraordinary appetite stimulant for a rich meal to follow.  It's beautiful in flat soup bowls -- and truly unusual on the palate.

  2        tablespoons  butter or oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (15 oz)
  2               cups  vegetable stock - (chicken stock is
                        also excellent, and more traditional)
     1/4           cup  uncooked rice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped basil (or 1 tspn pesto)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2               cups  half-and-half
                        (or 1 cup milk mixed
                        with 1 cup heavy cream)
                        Several dashes Tabasco sauce
                        or other hot pepper sauce
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Thinly-sliced basil leaves
                        or minced parsley

Melt butter in a large saucepan and stir in the onions and garlic.  Saute until soft and golden over medium-low heat.  Pour in the entire can of tomatoes, stock, rice, salt, pepper, basil, and thyme.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer for about 30 to 35 minutes. 
Puree the soup in a blender, solids first, then pour back into the saucepan.  Stir in the half-and-half, splash in the hot pepper sauce, and taste for seasoning.  Heat the soup just to a boil, then ladle into bowls.  Garnish with sliced basil leaves or minced parsley. 
Comments:  Thick, rich, and easy to make -- this tomato bisque will stick to your ribs.  It's perfect for lunch with a half sandwich -- and nice as a substantial first course for dinner.  Serve hot to 6 people.

  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2           cups  fish stock
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (16 oz) -- undrained, diced
  1              pinch  sugar
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  2               cans  chopped clams - (6 oz ea)

Melt butter in a large saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes over low heat.  Pour in the fish stock slowly, whisking constantly, until thickened -- then stir in the clam juice from the tins, reserving the clams themselves until the very end (so they don't toughen). 
Gradually add the cream, then the tomato sauce, then the tomatoes, sugar, and seasonings.  Simmer uncovered at low heat for about 30 minutes. 
When ready to serve, remove the bay leaf, add the clams, season to taste, and heat through for a minute or two.  Ladle into bowls with a garnish of chives or thyme. 
Comments:  Boy, is this good -- a rib-sticking, rich, yet delicate first course; serve hot for 6 to 8 people.

  6               cups  stock - (chicken is traditional,
                        but vegetable is fine)
  1                     dried ancho chile
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fried corn tortillas
                        Fresh cheese in small cubes
                        (queso fresco, farmer's or Monterey Jack)
                        Finely-chopped avocado
                        Finely-chopped red pepper
                        Lime wedges
                        Reserved ancho -- crumbled

First cut off the stem of the ancho, cut it in half, and throw out the seeds.  Reserve 1/4 of the dried chile to use as garnish, then soak the rest of it in hot water. 
In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in oil over medium heat until they are golden brown -- as much as 12 minutes.  Puree with the tomatoes and soaked ancho, then pour back into the saucepan with the stock.  Bring to a boil, then let simmer for 30 minutes.  Season to taste with salt. 
While broth is simmering, prepare tortillas.  Traditionally, you cut day-old or dried-out corn tortillas in half, then slice the halves into thin strips--fry them on both sides in 1/3 cup of hot oil, until crisp -- then drain.  If time is of the essence, you can cheat with store bought. 
When ready to serve, arrange cubed cheese and chopped pepper and chopped avocado in 4 flat soup bowls, then ladle over the broth, sprinkle each with the crumbled ancho, top with a mound of fried tortillas and serve with a lime wedge.  The lime is important! 
You could, of course, do all of this at the table for a truly dramatic presentation. 
Serve hot to 4 as a substantial first course or as lunch. 
Comments:  There are as many different recipes for this classic Mexican soup as there are Mexican cooks...and enthusiasts.  Actor Matt Broderick is one of the latter, as captured in Paul Newman's Own Cookbook, but this isn't his recipe -- all the chili powder and cumin he recommends just overwhelms the soup to my mind.  This one uses the ancho chile of Michoac·n.  You want even hotter?  Use hotter chiles.  Also, I've selected a "pretty" combination of garnishes -- but, traditionally, you can just use whatever cheese, vegetables, even chicken that you've got around.  It's the presentation of all these garnishes that makes it such a showstopper.

                     Toscanini's Rice And Celery Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  rice
  2               cups  beef stock
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped Italian parsley -- for garnish

Saute the celery in butter in a saucepan over a low heat, until it is tender.  Add the rice, stir to coat with the butter, then pour in the stock.  Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. 
When ready to serve, pour into a bowl, sprinkle with parsely, and put hot toast points on the side. 
Comments:  Here is the soup Maestro insisted on eating before conducting a concert.  Why?  Because it warmed and soothed him -- just enough and not too much to sustain a superhuman effort.  And it works, especially when you make it a tradition.  Serve hot to yourself -- better, have someone else lovingly serve it to you, someone who truly understands your right to be tempermental....

                   True Andalusian Gazpacho - {Spanish}

Recipe By     :JosÈ Luis Vivas
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2         pounds  ripe fresh tomatoes
  2             pounds  cucumber
  3              large  green peppers - (to 4)
  1                     red pepper -- (optional,
                        strengthens colour)
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4)
  3             slices  crusty white bread
                        water -- to soak the bread
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  sherry vinegar
  3          teaspoons  coarse-ground salt
                        Garnish -- (see below)

Garnish:  When served "formally", gazpacho is presented with an array of garnish consisting of tomato, onion, cucumber, green pepper, hard-boiled egg, and Spanish dry ham, all diced.  Every item is put in a separate bowl so you can choose what garnish and how much you want.  When serving you can drop a few leaves of spearmint on each dish. 
Soak the bread in water.  Peel the cucumbers and remove the seeds from the peppers.  Chop and blend all the vegetables, garlic last of all.  Add the soaked bread, oil, vinegar and salt and blend again.  Serve very cold.  If you don't have the time to put it to cool, just add some ice cubes when serving.  If you want a smoother texture you can peel the tomatoes and remove the seeds from them and the cucumbers. 
Mr. Vivas says, "You can see the quantities are very large.  This is because we usually make a large batch of this "base cream" and thin it with water to taste, as you can either eat it from a dish like a pureed salad or, as we very often we like to do in our hot summers, drink it in a glass.  For smaller batches, just keep the proportions." 
Comments:  I was so pleased to get this recipe and also one for Ajoblanco from JosÈ Luis Vivas, a native of Seville currently living in Brussels and working as a conference interpreter.  Thanks to his expertise, I have been able to correct a number of site entries regarding gazpacho -- and have also gained insight into Alice B. Toklas' understanding of soups and Seville.  Many thanks to this gifted polyglot, hot air balloon crewman, and connoisseur.  The preceeding recipe, his own personal version, is both authentic and wonderful.  I included most of his commentary verbatim.

           Turkish Spiced Tomato Soup - {Soguk Domates Corbasi}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  tomato puree -- preferably fresh
                        summer tomatoes, but canned are fine too
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  yogurt -- beaten til creamy
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

Puree tomatoes in a blender until liquified, then add oil, lemon juice, vinegar, curry powder, and salt.  Blend, then pour in yogurt and mix well.  Chill for at least 2 hours. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with minced parsley. 
Comments:  I love this cold soup; it's light, refreshing, tart -- and a gorgeous shade of shell pink.  Also, really fast and easy to make.  Serve it in small bowls to 4 to 6 people as a wonderful first course to any meal of grilled meats or vegetables, or of roast chicken.  If you use no-fat yogurt, which is delicious, it has practically no calories.

Comments:  I love this cold soup; it&apos;s light, refreshing, tart -- and a gorgeous shade of shell pink.  Also, really fast and easy to make.  Serve it in small bowls to 4 to 6 people as a wonderful first course to any meal of grilled meats or vegetables, or of roast chicken.  If you use no-fat yogurt, which is delicious, it has practically no calories.

                  Turkish Wedding Soup - {Dugun Corbasi}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  lamb or beef -- diced fine,
                        or ground
  1                     carrot -- chopped fine
  1                     onion -- chopped fine
  5               cups  beef stock
  2                     egg yolks
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2    tablespoon  paprika
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Light croutons -- for garnish

Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add meat, carrots, and onions and saute over low heat for 10 minutes.  Stir in flour and cook until blended.  Gradually stir in stock, scraping up any bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.  Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for an hour. 
When ready to serve, remove soup from heat.  Beat the egg yolks, then beat the lemon juice into them -- and slowly stir into the soup.  Ladle into bowls -- then quickly saute the paprika and cayenne in the tablespoon of butter and swirl equally into the individual soup servings.  Top with croutons. 
Comments:  This hearty soup is traditionally served at weddings -- but is a rich classic that can either set up an elegant dinner party or fill up a family of 4 for dinner.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
     1/2           cup  rice
  4                     egg yolks
  3               cups  yogurt
  6        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2           cups  water
  4        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  dried mint - (to 4 tbspns) -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste

Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan, add the rice, then reduce to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, until the rice is soft. 
In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with the yogurt and flour.  Add the water and blend to the consistency of a thin batter.  Gradually pour into the soup through a sieve, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        = {Acquacotta - or "Cooked Water"} =
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- minced
                        (or other small chili pepper)
  1              pound  spinach -- torn big pieces,
                        with thick stems discarded
  1                can  tomatoes - (10 oz) -- seeds squeezed out
  6               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs -- (for thickening)
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  6                     eggs -- (for poaching)
                        === GARNISH ===
  6       thick slices  coarse dense bread -- grilled or broiled

Heat the oil in a Dutch oven (you want a wide area for poaching the eggs at the end), then saute the celery, onion, and chili pepper over low heat until the onion is transparent.  Stir in the spinach until it has wilted and glazed with the other vegetables.  Stir in the tomatoes and let them cook over low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Pour in 6 cups of water and bring to a boil -- then reduce heat and let simmer for about an hour. 
When ready to serve, beat the 2 eggs and the Parmesan cheese together, then stir into the soup.  Let the soup return to a boil over medium heat.  Break each of the 6 eggs into the soup on spots that are exactly where you see the soup bubbling.  Simmer gently for about 3 minutes, so that the eggs are all nicely poached. 
To serve, place a piece of grilled bread in each bowl.  Top each one with one of the poached eggs.  Then ladle the soup on top. 
Serve hot as a light meal to 6 people. 
Comments:  This fine Tuscan soup was a special request of the Walkers in Sevierville, Tennessee.  Definitely not for spinach haters.  I did not think I was going to like it at all -- but, in fact, it's wonderful.  Total comfort food and very good for you.  It came from the practice of shepherds and charcoal burners in the Maremma part of Tuscany: they'd toss whatever was at hand into pots of water they had simmering and end up with an evening meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  leeks, white parts only -- washed well,
                        and sliced thinly
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish

Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat, then stir in the leeks and saute at a very low temperature, stirring occasionally, until they are golden.  Add the stock, potatoes, and salt -- bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer for 40 minutes.  Puree, then press through a sieve to get a very fine texture. 
Return to the saucepan, add the milk and pepper, and bring to a simmer.  Remove from heat, stir in the cream, adjust for seasoning (cold soups should be slightly overseasoned), and chill overnight. 
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls (nested glass cups with ice would be nice) and sprinkle with chopped fresh chives. 
Serve cold to 4 people, or 2 little piggies. 
Comments:  A simply heavenly American creation...by a French chef, of course.  In memory of the potato soup his mother used to serve him as a boy, Louis Diat created it as a cool first course.
