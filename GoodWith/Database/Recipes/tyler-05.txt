  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  2               cups  cranberry juice
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  potato starch
  1                cup  cold water
  1 1/2           cups  sour cream
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  8                     gingersnaps - (to 10) -- crushed

Add the apples, cranberry juice, sugar and cinnamon to a saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the apples are very soft, about 10 minutes.

Dissolve the potato starch in 1 cup cold water.  Pour this slurry into the hot apple mixture, stirring constantly.  Continue stirring until the kissel starts to bubble again, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and pour into individual dessert dishes.  Allow them to cool then refrigerate them for at least 2 hours.

In a small bowl mix the sour cream with the brown sugar and lemon juice.  To serve, put a good dollop of the sweet sour cream on top of the kissel and swirl it in with a spoon.  Garnish with the crushed gingersnaps.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shrimp
  20                    wooden skewers -- soaked 30 minutes
     1/2           cup  soy sauce -- plus
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sake
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, and
                        hand-crushed
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  red chili paste
                        = (Srirachi Hot Chili Sauce recommended)
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     avocados -- peeled, sliced
  2                     scallions -- sliced thin
                        Lime wedges

Thread shrimp onto water-soaked skewers and place in a shallow dish.  Pour 1/2 cup soy sauce, sake, and 2 tablespoons oil over the shrimp and season them with salt and pepper.  Set aside and let them marinate while you make the barbecue sauce.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in tomatoes and season with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce, hoisin sauce, vinegar, chili paste, sugar, and chili powder.  Cook until the mixture has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Use an immersion blender to break the tomatoes up into a chunky sauce.

Heat a grill or a grill pan and cook the shrimp about 3 minutes per side.  To serve, spread some barbecue sauce onto a large platter and place the grilled shrimp skewers on top of that.  Garnish with avocado, scallions, and lime wedges.  Serve extra barbecue sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Beef Chili With Red Beans And Chocolate

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  beef shoulder -- cut large cubes
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  onions -- diced
  5                     garlic cloves -- halved
  3                     canned chipotle peppers in adobo -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- chopped
     1/2           cup  Ancho Chili Powder -- (see recipe)
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2               cans  kidney beans - (15 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
     1/4           cup  cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  grated unsweetened chocolate
  3               cups  shredded white Cheddar -- for serving
  16                    saltine crackers -- for serving

Making chili is nothing more than mounting layers of flavor and letting them all simmer together.  Get in the habit of tasting recipes in stages; this way if something is not quite right, adjustments can be made on the spot.

Season the beef shoulder all over with salt and pepper then put it in a large soup pot.  Add enough water to cover by 1 inch, about 3 quarts, and place over medium heat.  Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that rises to the surface.  Mix in the onions, garlic, chipotles, and jalapeÒo.  Stir in the Ancho Chile Powder.

Pour the entire can of tomatoes, with the liquid, into a bowl and hand-crush until chunky; add the crushed tomatoes to the pot along with the tomato paste.  Simmer until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours.  As it cooks down, add more water if necessary.  After the chili has cooked a couple of hours, take a wooden spoon and beat it vigorously so the meat shreds apart.

Add the next layer of flavor by stirring in the beans and cornmeal.  Season with salt and pepper and simmer for another hour, stirring occasionally.  Partially cover the pot so the steam does not get trapped under the lid and drip down into the chili making it watery.  In the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir in the grated chocolate.  Garnish each serving with shredded Cheddar and saltine crackers.

This recipe yields 3 quarts; 6 to 8 servings.

                  Beef Stroganoff Over Buttered Noodles

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  beef stock
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  2             pounds  chuck roast -- cut 2" cubes
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  cognac
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  sour cream -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1            package  wide egg noodles - (16 oz)

Heat the beef stock with the carrot, 3 thyme sprigs, and bay leaf.  Pat the beef dry and season it with salt and pepper.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat.  Fry the meat in batches so that it is browned on all sides.  Lower the heat to medium and return all the meat to the pot.  Add the onions and cook until they are soft, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the cognac and cook until the alcohol has burned off, about 5 minutes.  Add the beef stock, discarding the carrot, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf.  Cook, partially covered, over a very low flame for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Add the mushrooms, garlic, and remaining 3 thyme sprigs and cook until the mushrooms are browned and cooked through.  Remove from heat and set aside.

When the meat is done, remove it from the heat and fold in the mushrooms, sour cream, mustard, and parsley.  Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender.  Drain the noodles well, toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and season with salt and pepper.  Serve the stroganoff over the noodles; garnish with more sour cream and chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  beer -- pilsner or ale
  1                     egg yolk
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Sage or basil leaves
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and butterflied
     1/2         pound  calamari -- cut into rings
     1/2         pound  fresh white anchovies or sardines -- cleaned, filleted
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Put flour into a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the beer, 1/2 half at a time, whisking to work out any lumps.  Add the egg yolk and mix well to combine.  The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream.

In a wok or deep fat fryer, heat a couple of inches of oil to 375 degrees.  Rinse and dry all ingredients to be fried.  Fry the ingredients in the order listed.

Coat ingredients with flour, shaking off the excess.  Dip in batter and immediately place into hot oil.  Do not overcrowd pan.  Cook until golden: the herbs will cook quickly, the seafood will take a bit longer.  Skim any loose pieces of batter from the oil.  Drain on paper towels.  Place on a large platter, season with salt and pepper, and squeeze over some lemon wedges.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     ham hock - (abt 1 lb)
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  dried black beans - (abt 1 lb) -- picked over, rinsed
  6               cups  water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 6-quart pressure cooker over medium-high heat, pour in 3 tablespoons oil.  Add the ham hock and onions and cook until the onions are wilted and the ham hock is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Throw in the garlic and bay leaf and cook for 1 minute more.

Add the beans and give a good stir.  Pour in the water; add the remaining tablespoon of oil, 1 tablespoon of salt, and a couple of grindings of pepper.

Following the manufacturer's instructions, cover, lock the lid, and bring to high pressure.  Lower heat to maintain pressure and start timing.  Cook at high pressure for 25 minutes.  Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes.

Release the steam, again following the manufacturer's directions.  If the beans are underdone, simmer them with the lid off until tender.  Remove bay leaf and discard.  Pick meat from ham hock and add to beans; discard the bone.  Taste and adjust seasoning.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Cook's note:  The oil prevents the beans from foaming and clogging the steam vent of the pressure cooker.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried black-eyed peas
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     ham hock
  2             quarts  chicken stock or water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Put the peas in a pot and cover with water by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat, cover, and let them soak for 1 hour.  (Or cover the with cold water and let them soak overnight.)

Add the soaked peas and the stock and cook, covered, until the peas are tender, about 20 minutes.  Add some water if you need more liquid.  Remove the ham hock and fold in the tomato mixture.  Taste, season with salt and pepper, and serve.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     peaches -- peeled, sliced
                        = (abt 6 to 8 cups)
     1/4           cup  bourbon
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
  2        tablespoons  corn starch
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  16       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
     3/4           cup  heavy cream -- plus
                        more for brushing

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl add the peaches, bourbon, 1/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon and mix well to coat the peaches evenly; set aside.

Prepare the dumplings:  Into a bowl sift together the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter into small pieces.  Add it to the flour mixture and cut it in with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture looks like coarse bread crumbs.  Pour in the cream and mix just until the dough comes together.  Don't overwork; the dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.

In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter.  Add the peaches and cook gently until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls over the warm peaches.  There can be gaps, the dough will puff up and spread out as it bakes.  Brush the top with some heavy cream and sprinkle with some sugar; put it into the oven on a baking sheet to catch any drips.  Cook for 40 to 45 minutes until the top is browned and the fruit is bubbling.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ancho chiles
  2                     dried chipotle chiles
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     bone-in pork shoulder - (3 to 5 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  4             sprigs  thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
  1                     orange -- halved
  1                     lime -- halved
  24                    Corn Tortillas -- (see recipe)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Avocado -- sliced thin,
                        Radishes -- sliced thin,
                        Tomatillo Salsa Verde -- (see recipe)

Put the chiles into a small bowl and cover with hot water; set aside.

In a large heavy-bottomed pan with a tight fitting lid, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Generously season the pork with salt and pepper.  Brown the meat well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side; remove the meat and set aside.

Add the onion, pepper, garlic, cumin, thyme, and bay leaf; fry until softened, about 5 minutes, scraping up the browned bits in the pan.  Stem and seed the soaked chiles reserving the soaking liquid; hand tear them into the pot.

Return the meat to the pan along with any accumulated juices.  Top the meat with the tomatoes.  Pour in the chili soaking liquid, straining out any seeds, until it almost covers the meat; add water if you need more liquid.  Squeeze the orange and lime juices into the pot and add the rinds.

Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the pork is very tender.  Remove the meat to a platter and cover to keep warm.  Strain the braising liquid and reserve.

Shred the pork.  Add some of the reserved braising liquid if the meat is dry.  Take a tortilla and place about 2 tablespoons of the mixture on top.  Garnish with the avocado, radishes, and Salsa Verde; fold the sides up and serve.

This recipe yields about 24 tacos.

Put the chiles into a small bowl and cover with hot water; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large heavy-bottomed pan with a tight fitting lid, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Generously season the pork with salt and pepper.  Brown the meat well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side; remove the meat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onion, pepper, garlic, cumin, thyme, and bay leaf; fry until softened, about 5 minutes, scraping up the browned bits in the pan.  Stem and seed the soaked chiles reserving the soaking liquid; hand tear them into the pot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the meat to the pan along with any accumulated juices.  Top the meat with the tomatoes.  Pour in the chili soaking liquid, straining out any seeds, until it almost covers the meat; add water if you need more liquid.  Squeeze the orange and lime juices into the pot and add the rinds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the pork is very tender.  Remove the meat to a platter and cover to keep warm.  Strain the braising liquid and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Shred the pork.  Add some of the reserved braising liquid if the meat is dry.  Take a tortilla and place about 2 tablespoons of the mixture on top.  Garnish with the avocado, radishes, and Salsa Verde; fold the sides up and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 24 tacos.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  1                cup  cold vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk - (to 2) -- plus
                        additional for brushing

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.  Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Make a well in the center and add 1 cup buttermilk.  Using your hands, quickly fold the dry ingredients into the buttermilk until a sticky dough forms.  You may need to add more buttermilk.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  Gently fold the dough over itself 3 or 4 times to create layers.  Press the dough out to 1 1/2-inches thick and cut with a floured 3-inch biscuit cutter.

Lay the biscuits on an ungreased cookie sheet and brush the tops with buttermilk.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until risen and golden brown.

This recipe yields 9 biscuits.

  4                     boneless chicken breasts with skin

     1/4           cup  peanut oil

  4                     carrots
  6                     radishes
                        = (or 4" piece daikon radish)
  1                     handful fresh mint leaves
  1                     handful fresh cilantro leaves
  2                     navel oranges
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  orange flower water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Slice carrots and radishes as thinly as possible and add to a large bowl.  Add mint and cilantro.  Remove the peel and pith from the oranges.

Working over a bowl to catch the juice, cut between the membranes to remove the orange segments; add them to the carrots.  Squeeze the membrane to extract the rest of the juice and add the cinnamon, sugar, lemon juice, orange flower water, and salt, to taste.  Mix to dissolve sugar and salt.

Pour over the carrot mixture and gently toss to coat.  The salad can be served immediately but allowing it to sit for 1 or 2 hours will help the flavors to blend.  Just before serving, taste and adjust seasoning.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Pour over the carrot mixture and gently toss to coat.  The salad can be served immediately but allowing it to sit for 1 or 2 hours will help the flavors to blend.  Just before serving, taste and adjust seasoning.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  top round steak
  3               cups  buttermilk
  2          teaspoons  hot sauce
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2                     eggs
  4                     strips bacon
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Slice the steak into 4 pieces.  Place each piece between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound thin, about 1/4-inch thick.  Place the pieces in a shallow bowl and pour over 1 cup buttermilk, 1 teaspoon hot sauce, and thyme leaves; season with salt and pepper.  Marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

In a shallow plate, season 2 cups flour with cumin, salt, and pepper.  In another shallow plate lightly beat the eggs and add 1 cup buttermilk and 1 teaspoon hot sauce; season with salt and pepper.

Remove the steaks from the marinade and shake off the excess buttermilk.  Dredge in the flour, dip into the beaten egg mixture, and dredge again in the seasoned flour; set on plate to rest for a few minutes while you cook the bacon.

Slice the bacon into 1-inch pieces and place them into a large cold skillet.  Set the skillet over medium heat and cook until the bacon is crisp.  Drain the bacon on paper towels and reserve the fat in the skillet.

Cook the steaks in the bacon fat over medium heat until they are golden brown on each side, about 10 minutes; set aside and keep warm.

Drain off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan.  Add 2 tablespoons flour and cook for about 1 minute breaking up any lumps.  Slowly pour in the remaining cup of buttermilk stirring constantly to break up lumps.  Cook for 5 minutes until thickened; season with salt and pepper and stir in the parsley.

Place the steaks on plates and top with the gravy; garnish with bacon.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    wooden skewers
  10                    small whole calamari -- cleaned, and
                        tentacles removed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for grilling
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        cut into chunks
  1             medium  red onion -- sliced thin
  1             medium  cucumber -- sliced thin
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  kalamata olives -- pitted
  1               head  romaine lettuce -- torn bite size
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Fresh oregano leaves -- for garnish

Soak 20 wooden skewers in water for about 20 minutes.

Rinse the calamari tubes and pat dry.  Split the bodies from top to bottom so you have 2 triangular pieces.  Thread a soaked skewer through the length of each piece.  Put the skewers on a platter and set aside.

To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the oil, vinegar, garlic, dried and fresh oregano, thyme and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Pour 1/2 of the vinaigrette over the calamari; set the other 1/2 aside while you make the salad.

In a large bowl, add the tomatoes, onion, cucumber, cheese, olives, and romaine.  Pour the remaining vinaigrette over the salad and toss to combine.  Let marinate while you grill the calamari.

Heat the grill or a grill pan and oil it lightly.  Grill the calamari for 2 minutes on each side, no longer or they will be tough.

To serve, put the salad onto a large platter and top it with the calamari skewers.  Garnish with fresh oregano leaves and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Soak 20 wooden skewers in water for about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse the calamari tubes and pat dry.  Split the bodies from top to bottom so you have 2 triangular pieces.  Thread a soaked skewer through the length of each piece.  Put the skewers on a platter and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the oil, vinegar, garlic, dried and fresh oregano, thyme and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Pour 1/2 of the vinaigrette over the calamari; set the other 1/2 aside while you make the salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, add the tomatoes, onion, cucumber, cheese, olives, and romaine.  Pour the remaining vinaigrette over the salad and toss to combine.  Let marinate while you grill the calamari.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the grill or a grill pan and oil it lightly.  Grill the calamari for 2 minutes on each side, no longer or they will be tough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, put the salad onto a large platter and top it with the calamari skewers.  Garnish with fresh oregano leaves and lemon wedges.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  romaine lettuce
  2                     tomatoes -- seeded
  1                     avocado
     1/2         pound  turkey breast
  8             slices  bacon -- cooked
     1/2         pound  bleu cheese
  4                     hard cooked eggs -- shelled, sliced
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     ciabatta rolls or a baguette

Chop the lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, turkey, bacon, cheese, and eggs into 1/2-inch pieces and put them into a large bowl.  Add the parsley, lemon juice, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper; mix well to coat all the ingredients.

Slice the rolls horizontally.  Drizzle a small amount of olive oil on each of the cut sides.  On the 4 bottoms place about 1/2 cup of the chopped salad and spread it out evenly.  Put the tops on and gently press each sandwich to flatten it slightly; drizzle lightly with olive oil.

Place each sandwich on a preheated panini press and grill until the bread is toasted and the cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes.  Alternately, preheat a dry cast-iron or non-stick pan.  Place the sandwich in the pan and weight it down with another pan or a clean brick wrapped in foil.  Grill 5 minutes, turn the sandwich over, re-weight it, and grill for another 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  masa harina
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  warm water
  2          teaspoons  honey

Put the masa harina in a bowl and mix in the salt.  Add about 1 cup warm water and mix with your hands; add more water as needed until the dough comes together.  Knead for a few minutes to smooth the dough out.  The dough should be firm and springy and should not stick to your hands.  Test by forming a small disk, if it cracks around the edges you need more water.

Place a piece of heavy plastic (like from a garbage bag) onto a tortilla press.  Form a 1 1/2-inch ball of dough and place it in the center of the press.  Top with another piece of plastic, close the press, and push the lever down to form the tortilla.  (Alternately, the dough balls can be rolled between plastic sheets with a rolling pin.)

Open the press and remove the top layer of plastic.  Carefully peel the tortilla off the bottom plastic and place it onto a hot, ungreased cast-iron skillet; cook for about 1 to 2 minutes per side.  Remove the tortilla and place it on a clean tea towel; keep it covered to keep it soft and pliable.  Continue until you have used up all the dough.

This recipe yields 20 (6-inch) tortillas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries -- chopped
  1                cup  orange liqueur -- (optional)
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)
                        Melted butter for brushing molds -- plus
  4        tablespoons  room temperature butter -- cut small pieces
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1            package  yeast
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
  2               cups  sugar -- for syrup
  1                     egg -- room temperature
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  orange flower water
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
                        Whipped cream -- for serving

Put the cranberries and orange liqueur (or 1 cup warm water) into a small bowl and set aside.  Brush 12 baba molds, a popover pan, or a muffin tin with melted butter and set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together the water, yeast, sugar, and egg.  Using the paddle attachment, stir in the flour until incorporated.  Mix on medium speed for 6 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl once.  Add butter and mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Cover and let rise in a warm spot for about 15 to 20 minutes, it just needs to rise a bit not double in volume.

Drain the cranberries (reserve the soaking liquid) and mix into the dough with a spatula or wooden spoon.  Fill the baba molds (or popover pan or muffin tin) half full with batter.  Let rise in a warm spot until the dough fills the molds, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bake the babas for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are a deep golden brown.  Remove from molds, put babas onto a rack set over a sheet pan, and allow them to cool completely.

Bring 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water to a boil.  Boil for 1 minute and remove from the heat; stir in the reserved soaking liquid and the orange flower water.  Using tongs or a spoon, place the babas, 1 at a time, into the sugar syrup.  Hold them under until the air bubbles stop coming out of the cakes, about 5 to 10 seconds.  Drain on the rack; you can recycle the syrup that accumulates in the sheet pan.

Warm the marmalade and brush it onto the tops of the babas.  To serve, split open and top with a generous dollop of freshly whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 babas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted, cooled,
                        plus more for greasing the pan
  1                cup  walnut pieces -- toasted
     3/4           cup  pistachios
  1                cup  dried apricots
     1/4           cup  honey
  4                     phyllo pastry sheets
  5          teaspoons  sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush a sheet pan with melted butter.

In a food processor, pulse the walnuts and pistachios until coarsely chopped.  Transfer the nuts to a large bowl.  Put the apricots in the processor and pulse them until coarsely chopped, add to the nut mixture and mix well with your hands to combine.  Add 2 tablespoons of the honey and 1/4 cup of the melted butter; toss.

Unroll the phyllo dough and lay the sheets flat on a work surface.  Keep the pastry covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out.  Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the buttered pan and brush it with more melted butter and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of sugar.  Repeat with the 3 remaining sheets of phyllo, stacking each on top of each other and sprinkling each with sugar.

Spread the nut filling in a thin layer on top of the pastry, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides.  Fold in the long sides and roll up the pastry like a cigar.  Brush the entire top with even more melted butter and sprinkle the pastry log with the remaining teaspoon of sugar.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.

Slice the borek into 1-inch pinwheels.  Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey before serving.

This recipe yields 12 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               ears  fresh corn
  2        tablespoons  masa harina
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
     1/4         pound  Venezuelan cheese -- sliced
                        = (Queso blanco, mozzarella, or feta can
                        be substituted)

Scrape corn kernels from the cobs; run the back of your knife along the cob to extract all the corn liquid.  Put corn into a food processor and pulse a few times to break up the kernels.  Add masa harina and salt and pulse to incorporate.

Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium low heat.  Divide the mixture into 4 and make 4 corn cakes.  Cover and let the cakes cook for 5 minutes.  Uncover the pan and carefully flip the cachapas over.  Press on them with a spatula to flatten them a bit.  Cook, covered, for another 5 minutes.

Uncover and cook for about 5 more minutes; they should be a dark golden brown.  Top with the cheese and cover until the cheese has melted.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 corn pancakes.

                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  cayenne
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  hot chili sauce
                        = (such as Srirachi Hot Chili Sauce)
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

Put the chicken pieces into a large bowl.  Cover the chicken with water by 1-inch; add 1 tablespoon of salt for each quart of water used.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

In a large shallow platter, mix the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne until well blended; season generously with salt and pepper.  In another platter combine the buttermilk and hot sauce; season with salt and pepper.

Drain the chicken and pat it dry.  Dredge the pieces, a few at a time, in the flour mixture, then dip them into the buttermilk; dredge them again in the seasoned flour.  Set aside and let the chicken rest while you heat the oil.

Put about 3 inches of oil into a large deep pot; it should not come up more than half way.  Bring the oil up to 375 degrees over medium-high heat.

Working in batches, carefully add the chicken pieces 3 or 4 at a time.  Fry, turning the pieces once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oil and place on a rack to drain; repeat with the remaining pieces.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  walnuts
     1/4           cup  almonds
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  6                     fresh or dried figs -- cut into quarters
  6                     dates -- pitted, chopped
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  water
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     cinnamon stick
  2               cups  Greek yogurt -- see * Note
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

* Note:  Greek yogurt is thicker and less sour than plain yogurt.  If you can't find Greek yogurt, drain regular yogurt, refrigerated, overnight through cheesecloth.

Toast the nuts in a saute pan over medium heat until they become fragrant.  Put the nuts onto a plate and set aside; when cool enough to handle, chop them roughly.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, add the figs, dates, honey, water, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick.  Cook for about 10 minutes until fruit is soft.  Set aside and let it cool slightly; remove the cinnamon stick.

Place the yogurt in a big bowl.  Spoon the warm fruit onto the yogurt and gently swirl the fruit through the yogurt.  Sprinkle on the nuts and garnish with mint leaves.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef tenderloin -- cut 2" strips
  20                    wooden skewers -- soaked 30 minutes
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Vegetable oil -- for grilling
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

Thread the beef onto the water-soaked skewers, working the skewers in and out of the meat so that it stays in place while grilling.

Combine yogurt, ginger, garlic, curry powder, and lemon juice in a shallow platter and stir to combine.  Place the beef skewers into the yogurt marinade and turn them until they are well coated.  Cover and let the meat marinate in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours.

Place a grill pan over medium heat and brush it with oil to prevent the meat from sticking.  Grill the satays for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until nicely seared and cooked through.  Serve piled on a large platter garnished with cilantro.

This recipe yields 20 skewers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  cherry tomatoes
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              heads  garlic
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2               cups  good-quality mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  hot chili paste
  1              whole  beef tenderloin* - (abt 6 to 8 lbs)
  2                     loaves focaccia bread -- sliced, toasted
                        Baby arugula -- for garnish

* Cook's note:  Have your butcher clean the fat and silver skin from the tenderloin and tie it.

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Toss the tomatoes into a roasting pan, drizzle with some olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until the tomatoes have collapsed, about 30 minutes.  Remove them from the oven and let them cool.

Drizzle the garlic with olive oil, wrap it in foil, and bake it until soft, about 30 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft garlic onto a cutting board.  Strip the needles from the rosemary, add them to the garlic, and chop them together.  Pour 1 cup olive oil into a small bowl; add the garlic and rosemary mixture and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper and mix well.  Set aside until ready to grill.

Char the outside of the pepper under the broiler or over a gas flame.  Put it into a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap.  When cool enough to handle, peel, seed, and chop and put it into a blender.  Add the mayonnaise and chili paste; process until smooth.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; refrigerate until ready to use.  (Can be made the day before.)

Heat the grill.  Remove the meat from the refrigerator about 1/2 hour before you are going to grill it.  Brush it with some of the flavored olive oil and season it generously with salt and pepper.  Grill the tenderloin, turning frequently, until the meat is rare or medium-rare, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove to a platter and let it rest for 5 minutes, brushing it with the flavored olive oil.  Cut the beef into thin slices.

To serve, put some of the flavored mayonnaise onto a piece of focaccia toast.  Top it with a thin slice of the beef and spoon on some of the roasted tomatoes.  Garnish with some arugula leaves and serve.

This recipe yields enough for a crowd! 30 plus servings.

                        = (or cayenne pepper)

Soak the corn in a large container of water for 1 hour.  Prepare the grill.  Put the soaked cobs on the hot grill and cook for 30 to 40 minutes, turning frequently.  The corn is done when it feels soft when you press on it.

While the corn is grilling make the lime butter:  In a small bowl add the butter, lime zest, chervil, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Mix well and spread onto a large plate.  Spread the queso fresco onto another plate.

Take the corn off the grill and carefully peel back the husks (it will be hot).  Remove the corn silk and tie the husks in a knot so you can hold on to it like a handle.  Roll in the lime butter and then roll in the queso fresco; sprinkle with the Ancho Chile Rub.  Place on a large platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for grilling
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3 1/2         pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- butterflied
  1              bunch  mache
  1              bunch  mint -- leaves only
  2                     scallions -- sliced thin
                        Lemony Chickpea Puree -- (see recipe)

To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the oil, vinegar, garlic, dried and fresh oregano, thyme, and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Pat the lamb dry and place it into a shallow platter.

Toss the mache, mint leaves, and scallions in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Dress the salad with about 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and mix well.  Place the lamb onto a serving board.

To serve, spread the Lemony Chickpea Puree over the lamb and put the greens on top of the puree.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  8             slices  good-quality white bread
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  peanut butter -- smooth or crunchy

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLACK EYED PEAS ===
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  3                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1                     fresh green chile -- halved
  1              pound  dried black eyed peas
  2                     smoked ham hocks - (4 oz ea)
  2                     bay leaves
  2             quarts  water
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     vine-ripe tomato -- seeded, chopped
  2                     canned chipotle peppers in adobo -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                     orange -- zested, juiced
  1                     lime -- zested, juiced
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
  3             pounds  extra-large shrimp -- peeled, butterflied
  2        tablespoons  Ancho Chili Powder -- (see recipe)
     1/2                lime -- juiced
  2                     large handfu fresh cilantro leaves -- chopped
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  green onions, white and green parts -- chopped
  3                     vine-ripe tomatoes -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- thinly sliced

To prepare the black eyed peas:  Place a 2-gallon stock pot over medium heat.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and add the garlic and green chile, saute until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the black eyed peas, ham hocks, bay leaves, and water.  Simmer for 45 minutes until the beans are tender, stirring when you think about it.  Wait until halfway through cooking to begin seasoning with salt and pepper.  You want the flesh of the bean to break down a little bit so it can penetrate the inside.  Drain the black eyed beans and shred the ham hocks; set them aside to cool.

To prepare the vinaigrette:  Puree the tomato, chipotle, sugar, citrus juices, and zest in a blender until smooth.  Pour in 1/4 cup of olive oil and puree again until emulsified and slightly thickened.

To prepare the shrimp:  Put the butterflied shrimp in a glass bowl and add the ancho powder, lime juice, half of the cilantro, and a drizzle of olive oil; tossing to coat.  Marinate for 15 minutes while heating up the grill.

Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot.  Brush the grates with oil to keep the shrimp from sticking.  Remove the shrimp from the marinade and season with salt and pepper.  Lay the shrimp on the hot grill and cook 4 minutes on each side until charred and firm.

To serve:  Combine the black eyed peas, shredded ham hock meat, green onions, tomatoes, jalapeÒo, and the remaining cilantro in a large salad bowl.  Add the grilled shrimp and vinaigrette; toss the salad well to incorporate all the ingredients and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 to 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  skirt steak -- excess fat trimmed
  1             recipe  Ancho Chili Powder -- (see recipe)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     ripe yet firm peaches -- halved, pitted
  3                     limes -- cut 1/4" slices
  4               cups  micro greens or baby mixed greens
  1                cup  toasted pecans

Lay the steak out on a large platter or piece of plastic wrap and rub both sides with the Ancho Chili Powder.  Marinate for 1 hour so the flavors can penetrate the meat.

In the meantime, place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot.  Brush the grates with oil to keep food from sticking.  Rub the peaches with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Put the peaches cut-side down on the grill and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until the flesh softens slightly and caramelizes.  Turn them over with tongs and grill the other side for 3 minutes to char the skin; remove to a platter.  Grill the lime slices for 2 minutes each side until slightly charred.

Scrape off the excess chili powder on the surface of the steak so it doesn't burn on the grill.  Rub the steak with oil and season both sides with salt and pepper.  Grill the steak on the hottest part of the barbecue for 4 minutes per side, until well charred.  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes.  Cut the meat across the grain on the diagonal.

To serve:  Put the greens on a platter and arrange the peach halves, lime slices, and steak on top.  Sprinkle with the pecans and drizzle the salad with the olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 to 10 servings.

            Homemade Potato Chips With Bleu Cheese And Chives

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Yukon gold potatoes - (abt 2 lbs)
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
  1              pound  bleu cheese -- finely crumbled
  1              bunch  chives -- chopped

Peel the potatoes and slice them into thin 1/8-inch slices using a mandolin or sharp knife.  Rinse the slices in several changes of water until the water runs clear.  Drain them and pat them dry.

Put about 3 inches of oil into a large deep pot; it should not come up more than half way.  Bring the oil up to 325 degrees over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, carefully add the potato slices, a dozen at a time.  Stir them to make sure they are not sticking together.  Fry until they are a golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and drain them well on paper towels; season with salt.  Repeat with the remaining potato slices.

Heat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place a layer of the chips onto a baking dish and sprinkle with some of the bleu cheese and chives.  Place another layer of chips onto that and some more cheese and chives.  Continue until you have used up all the chips and cheese.  Put into the oven and bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.  Garnish with more chives.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 30    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  borlotti beans
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided, plus
                        more for garnish
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- finely chopped
  2             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  4                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  4                     carrots -- finely chopped
  4                     parsnips -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  6                     fresh sage leaves -- chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cans  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
  6             quarts  chicken stock
  3               cups  fresh white bread crumbs
  1                cup  grated Parmesan
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Soak the beans:  Put the beans in a large pot and cover them with water by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and cook the beans for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 1 hour.  (Or cover the beans with cold water and let them soak overnight.)

Start the soup:  In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add 3 tablespoons olive oil.  When the oil is hot add the pancetta, onion, celery, carrots, and parsnips and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons thyme, 2 tablespoons rosemary, the sage, and bay leaves.

Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the tomatoes and 1/4 cup olive oil.  Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, adding water if you need more liquid.  The soup should be thick: to thicken the soup, break up some of the beans with the back of a spoon.  Remove the bay leaves and discard before serving.

Toast the bread crumbs:  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mix the bread crumbs, remaining thyme and rosemary, and cheese on a baking sheet.  Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over about 1/4 cup olive oil; combine well.  Bake until the crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.

To serve, ladle the soup into small glasses, cups or mugs.  Drizzle on a little olive oil, top with the crispy crumbs, and serve.

This recipe yields 20 to 30 small servings.

  2        tablespoons  hot chili paste
                        = (Srirachi Hot Chili Paste recommended)
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
  3                     scallions -- sliced thin
  1 1/2         pounds  beef short ribs
  8                     baby lamb chops
                        === TO SERVE ===
                        Mixed lettuce leaves
  1              bunch  fresh mint
  1              bunch  fresh shiso or basil
  2                     fresh red hot peppers - (to 3)
                        Soy Sauce
                        Hot sauce or hot chili paste
                        Quick Spicy Kimchee -- (see recipe)
                        Sweet Pickled Daikon Radish -- (see recipe)
                        Cool Sesame Cucumbers -- (see recipe)

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add soy sauce, mirin, sake, water, brown sugar, pear, ginger, and garlic.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Puree in a blender and allow to cool.  Place the sliced tenderloin and the butterflied shrimp in separate shallow dishes.  Pour the puree over them, cover, and allow to marinate for 20 minutes.

Combine the chili paste, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and scallions.  Place the short ribs meat-side down on a cutting board.  With a sharp knife slice between the bone and the meat but do not cut all the way through.  Open like a book and carefully run the knife in the opposite direction to cut the meat in half, again not going all the way through.  You should now have a long flat piece of meat, about the thickness of the bone.  You can grill the short ribs in large pieces or cut the meat into smaller bite-sized pieces.  Place the short ribs and lamb chops in separate shallow dishes and toss with the spicy marinade.  Cover and marinate for 20 minutes.

Heat the grill, a grill pan, a cast-iron skillet, or an electric tabletop grill.  Grill the meats and shrimp until they are cooked to your liking.  Serve as you cook them accompanied by a platter of mixed lettuce leaves, mint leaves, shiso or basil leaves, and sliced hot peppers, as well as small bowls of soy sauce and hot sauce.  Also serve the Quick Spicy Kimchee, Sweet Pickled Daikon, and Cool Sesame Cucumbers in their own dishes.

Take a lettuce leaf in your hand.  Put 1 or 2 pieces of meat or shrimp and top this with any combination of the condiments.  Wrap the lettuce around the meat and eat out of hand.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

You should now have a long flat piece of meat, about the thickness of the bone.  You can grill the short ribs in large pieces or cut the meat into smaller bite-sized pieces.  Place the short ribs and lamb chops in separate shallow dishes and toss with the spicy marinade.  Cover and marinate for 20 minutes.

Heat the grill, a grill pan, a cast-iron skillet, or an electric tabletop grill.  Grill the meats and shrimp until they are cooked to your liking.  Serve as you cook them accompanied by a platter of mixed lettuce leaves, mint leaves, shiso or basil leaves, and sliced hot peppers, as well as small bowls of soy sauce and hot sauce.  Also serve the Quick Spicy Kimchee, Sweet Pickled Daikon, and Cool Sesame Cucumbers in their own dishes.

Take a lettuce leaf in your hand.  Put 1 or 2 pieces of meat or shrimp and top this with any combination of the condiments.  Wrap the lettuce around the meat and eat out of hand.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1              pound  mixed mushrooms
                        = (such as button, cremini, shiitake or
                        oyster)
     1/2         pound  fresh goat cheese
                        = (or other soft fresh cheese)
  2        tablespoons  truffle oil -- (optional)
                        = (found at gourmet and specialty food
                        shops)
  1              small  focaccia loaf
  1                     small bunch arugula

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and 2 tablespoons thyme and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until they are browned and soft, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let them cool for about 15 minutes.

Put the mushrooms into a food processor and pulse a few times until they are finely chopped.  (Alternately, you can chop them on a board with a knife.)  Scrape them into a bowl.  Crumble in the goat cheese and add the remaining thyme.  Pour in the truffle oil, if using, and mix well to combine.

Cut the focaccia into 4 pieces, slice them horizontally, and drizzle with some olive oil.  On the bottoms place 1/4 of the mushroom mixture and top with some arugula.  Put the tops on and gently press each sandwich to flatten it slightly.  Drizzle some more olive oil over the tops.

Place each sandwich on a preheated panini press and grill until the bread is toasted and the cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes.  Alternately, preheat a dry cast-iron or non stick pan.  Place the sandwich in the pan and weight it down with another pan or a clean brick wrapped in foil.  Grill 5 minutes, turn the sandwich over, re-weight it, and grill for another 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  chicken stock
  1                cup  barley
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  3               cups  plain yogurt
  2              large  egg yolks
  1                     small handfu fresh mint leaves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  paprika
                        = (or traditional Kirmizi biber or Aleppo
                        pepper if available)

Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot.  Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  Pour in the chicken stock and continue to stir well.  Bring the mixture to a simmer, and then add the barley and the salt.  Reduce the heat to medium-low flame, cover, and cook for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the barley is tender.

In a large mixing bowl, blend together the yogurt and egg yolks until smooth.

After the barley has softened, lower the heat and gradually whisk the yogurt mixture into the barley and cook just until it is ready to boil.

For the finishing touch, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a saute pan.  When the butter is foamy, mix in the mint and paprika.  Let this turn golden and stir it into the soup.  Serve the soup piping hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  Artic char - (3 to 4 lbs) -- scaled, cleaned
  2                     tangerines
  2                     fennel bulbs -- including fronds
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
                        === FENNEL AND OLIVE SALSA VERDE ===
     1/4           cup  reserved fennel fronds
     1/4           cup  parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  pitted green olives
  2        tablespoons  capers
  2                     anchovies
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     tangerine -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Rinse the fish and pat dry.  Slice the tangerines thinly; remove and reserve the fronds from the fennel bulbs and cut the bulbs into thick slices.  Mix them together in a bowl with 1/4 cup olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste.  Season the fish inside and out with salt and pepper.  Stuff the fish with the tangerine mixture and tie it closed with kitchen string.

Heat an ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat and add 1/4 cup olive oil.  When hot, toss in the fennel seeds and peppercorns.  Cook to flavor the oil for about 1 minute, remove the spices and discard them.  Place the fish in the pan and cook on each side for about 2 minutes.  Put the pan in the oven and roast the fish for about 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through.  Serve with the Fennel and Olive Salsa Verde.

Place the fennel fronds, parsley, olives, capers, and anchovies on a cutting board.  Chop them with a knife until they are very fine.  Put them into a bowl and stir in the olive oil, tangerine juice, and vinegar.  Taste the salsa and season with salt and pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta or bacon
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into cubes
  1                     pear -- cut small cubes
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
  1                cup  heavy cream -- plus
                        more for brushing
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmesan -- plus
                        extra for garnish

Coat a small skillet with olive oil and cook the pancetta over medium heat until it is crisp.  Drain on paper towels; break it up into pieces when it is cool.

Wipe out the skillet and heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat until it starts to brown; be careful not to let it burn.  Add the pear cubes and cook them until they are soft but still holding their shape, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside on a plate to cool.

Heat oven to 450 degrees.

Sift into a bowl the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Add the remaining butter and cut it in with a pastry blender or your hands until it resembles coarse bread crumbs.  Stir in the pepper, rosemary, and pancetta.  Add the cream; mix just until the dough has come together.

With floured hands, gather the dough into a ball and place it onto a floured surface.  Divide the dough into 8 pieces and form them into balls.  Place them onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.

Press a well into the center of each with your thumb, place 1 teaspoon of the cooled cooked pears into the well, and pinch the scones closed.  Sprinkle the tops with the cheese.

Bake the scones for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.  Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack.  Sprinkle with some more parmesan.

This recipe yields 8 scones.

                         Pasta Dough For Ravioli

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs -- plus
  1              large  egg -- for egg wash
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting

To make the pasta dough:  In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook*, combine the flour and salt.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix.  Drizzle in 1 tablespoons of the olive oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball.  Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes.  Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

*Alternatively if you don't have an electric mixer:  Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center.  Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork.  Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion.  Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall.  Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball.  Continue as directed above.

Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with a little flour.  Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting.  Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers.  Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times.  Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it).  Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed.

Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash.  Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue.  Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart.  Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket.  With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling.  Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tines of a fork to make a tight seal.  Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest.

Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they'll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot.  Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon.  Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve.

This recipe yields 24 ravioli.

Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting.  Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers.  Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times.  Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it).  Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash.  Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue.  Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart.  Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket.  With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling.  Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tines of a fork to make a tight seal.  Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they&apos;ll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot.  Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon.  Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve.

This recipe yields 24 ravioli.

                        Pineapple Glazed Pork Ribs

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  baby back pork ribs
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
     1/4           cup  Chinese five-spice powder
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds -- for garnish
                        Chopped fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        === PINEAPPLE GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              whole  fresh pineapple -- peeled, cubed
  1                cup  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                     fresh red chile -- sliced thin
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- whacked open with
                        the flat side of a knife

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Rub the ribs all over with the sesame oil; season generously with five-spice powder, salt, and pepper.  Arrange the ribs in a single layer in a shallow roasting pan and roast for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

To prepare the Pineapple Glaze:  In a saucepan over medium heat melt the butter and add the pineapple chunks; saute for 3 minutes.  Add the soy sauce, rum, hoisin sauce, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, chile, garlic, and ginger.  Bring to a slow simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 20 minutes.  Pull out the ginger pieces.  Pour the glaze into a blender and puree until smooth.

In the last 30 minutes of cooking, baste the ribs with some of the glaze.  When they are done, the pork will pull away from the bone and you will see about 1/2-inch of bone showing.  When you are ready to eat, baste the ribs with more glaze and stick them under the broiler for 5 to 8 minutes to give the ribs a nice crust.  (Watch them carefully as they can easily burn.)

Separate the ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife, pile them onto a platter, and pour on the remaining sauce.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds and chopped cilantro before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     carrots -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                     flank steak - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     red bell peppers -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained,
                        hand-crushed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Black Beans In A Pressure Cooker -- (see recipe)
                        Cooked white rice -- as an accompaniment
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

In a large casserole (that has a tight fitting lid) heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add the carrots, celery, and 1 onion and fry for a few minutes until softened; remove the vegetables to a plate.

Season the meat with salt and pepper; add 2 tablespoons more oil to the pan, if needed, and brown the meat on both sides, about 5 minutes.

Return the softened vegetables to the pan along with the bay leaf.  Add enough water to just about cover the meat and bring to a boil.  Lower heat, cover, and simmer gently until meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Remove meat from the pot and set aside; strain the liquid and reserve.

Add another 2 tablespoons oil to the pan and put in the peppers, garlic, tomatoes, and the remaining onion; fry on medium-low heat until everything is soft and broken down, about 15 minutes.  Shred the meat and add to the pan to heat through.  Add some of the reserved braising liquid if the mixture becomes too dry.  Serve with Black Beans and cooked white rice, garnish with cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  Napa cabbage - (abt 1 to 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  hot chili paste
                        = (Srirachi Hot Chili Paste recommended)
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- grated
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     scallions -- finely sliced

Remove outer leaves from cabbage.  Cut cabbage in quarters and remove the tough inner core.  Slice across sections into 1/2-inch slices.  Put into a colander, add salt, and mix well.  Place over a bowl and let drain, covered, until wilted, about 2 hours.

In a large bowl combine the vinegar and sugar and stir to dissolve.  Add the chili paste, ginger, garlic, and scallions and stir.

Rinse the salt off the cabbage with a couple of changes of water.  Dry well and add to the vinegar mixture; stir well to combine.  Put into a sterilized glass jar and pack the cabbage down; add enough water to cover.  Close the jar and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  This is spicy and gets spicier the longer it sits -- add or subtract chili paste to your taste.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

Rinse the salt off the cabbage with a couple of changes of water.  Dry well and add to the vinegar mixture; stir well to combine.  Put into a sterilized glass jar and pack the cabbage down; add enough water to cover.  Close the jar and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  This is spicy and gets spicier the longer it sits -- add or subtract chili paste to your taste.

Toss in the garlic and stir it around until it just begins to turn golden, not brown.  Carefully pour the herb sauce into the anchovy oil, stirring to incorporate.  Mix in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 24 ravioli.

                  Risotto-Style Strawberry Rice Pudding

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  strawberries -- rinsed, hulled
  1                cup  sugar
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated,
                        and juiced
  2             quarts  milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- seeds scraped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  Arborio rice
  1              pinch  kosher salt

Cut strawberries into medium-size dice.  In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add strawberries, 1/4 cup sugar, and lemon juice.  Cook until berries are soft and the juices have thickened slightly, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

Heat the milk in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until it starts to steam.  Remove one cup of milk, set it aside, and keep it warm.  Stir into the larger pan of milk the remaining sugar, the vanilla bean and seeds, and the rice.  Lower heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes.  Add the reserved milk, lemon zest, butter, and salt.  Stir well and remove from the heat.  This should have a more liquid consistency than regular risotto.

To serve, layer rice pudding and strawberry mixture in tall clear glasses.  Chill.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beets
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  6               cups  chicken stock -- heated
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
                        Sour cream -- for garnish

Heat oven to 400 degrees.

Scrub the beets and put them on a large piece of aluminum foil; season with salt and pepper, add 3 thyme sprigs, and drizzle with 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Bake until the beets are tender, about 1 hour.  Set aside.  When the beets are cool enough to handle but still warm, slip off their skins, and chop them into large chunks.

In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Put in the onion, carrots, garlic, and remaining 3 thyme sprigs and cook until softened and just starting to color, about 10 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove the thyme sprigs.

Put the chopped beets into a blender and add the cooked vegetables and most of the stock.  Blend until smooth, add more stock if the puree is too thick.  Add the vinegar and honey; season with salt and pepper.  Blend again to incorporate flavors.  Borscht can be served hot or cold.

To make the garnish, grate the apple on the large holes of a box grater and mix in the dill.  Serve in bowls, garnished with a big dollop of sour cream and topped with the apple and dill mixture.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                  Roasted Corn With Parmesan And Cayenne

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               ears  fresh corn -- unhusked
                        Mayonnaise -- as needed
                        Grated Parmesan -- as needed
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Lime wedges -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the corn, in its husks, directly on the oven rack and roast for 20 minutes until the corn is soft when you press on it.

To finish off the corn, peel down the husks, remove the corn silk, and tie the husks in a knot so you can hold on to it like a handle.  Char the corn on a hot grill, over a gas flame, or under a broiler, until the kernels are slightly blackened all around and start popping, about 6 minutes.

Rub the corn with mayonnaise, sprinkle with Parmesan and cayenne pepper so it's nicely coated.  Serve with lime wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     red bell peppers
     1/2         bunch  fresh oregano
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the peppers directly onto the burners of a gas stove.  Cook the peppers, turning frequently, until they are charred on all sides.  Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let them steam for about 15 minutes.  (If you do not have a gas stove preheat your oven to 400 degrees.  Coat the peppers with some olive oil and place them on a baking sheet.  Cook the peppers until they are soft and have collapsed, about 1 hour.  Set the peppers aside until they are cool enough to handle.)

Peel, stem, and seed the peppers; cut them into wide strips.  Place the warm pepper strips into a shallow serving dish.  Top with the oregano, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar.  Season them with salt and pepper and mix them gently to combine the flavors.  Let them sit to cool and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 appetizer servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  linguini
  4        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes -- (optional)
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley leaves

For the pasta, put a large pot of water on the stove to boil.  When it has come to the boil, add a couple of tablespoons of salt and the linguini.  Stir to make sure the pasta separates; cover.  When the water returns to a boil, cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until the pasta is not quite done.  Drain the pasta.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter in 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat.  Saute the shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) until the shallots are translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Season the shrimp with salt and pepper; add them to the pan and cook until they have turned pink, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the shrimp from the pan; set aside and keep warm.

Add wine and lemon juice and bring to a boil.  Add 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil.  When the butter has melted, return the shrimp to the pan along with the parsley and cooked pasta.  Stir well and season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle over a bit more olive oil and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1                cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sake
  1         tablespoon  hot chili sauce
                        = (Srirachi Hot Chili Sauce recommended)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        === TEMPURA ===
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                cup  rice flour -- plus
  1                cup  rice flour -- for dusting
  1                cup  cold seltzer water
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil -- (optional)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Make the Dipping Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl.  Set aside to allow the flavors to develop.

Butterfly the shrimp by cutting down the back, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Open the shrimp like a book and rinse well with cold water.

Make the Tempura Batter:  Put 1 cup of rice flour in a bowl and pour in the seltzer.  Stir with a whisk to get out all the lumps.  Add the egg yolk and blend it in well.  The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream.  Flavor with sesame oil, if using.

Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 375 degrees in a wok or deep fryer.

Dry the shrimp well.  Dust the shrimp in flour to soak up any remaining moisture, shake off excess.  Dip the shrimp into the batter one by one.  Drop 4 or 5 pieces at a time in the hot oil.  Do not overcrowd the pan.  Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 3 minutes.

To keep the oil clean between batches, skim off the small bits of batter that float in the oil.  Remove the fried shrimp from the oil and drain on paper towels; season them with salt.  Serve with the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  1                     fresh red chile -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  alfonso olives -- pitted
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil leaves
  3               cans  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        hand-crushed
  1              pinch  sugar
  1         tablespoon  capers
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  spaghetti
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino cheese

Heat a grill pan over medium heat.  Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch rounds.  Toss them with 1/4 cup olive oil and some salt and pepper.  Grill them until marks have formed and they are soft, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Place them onto a paper towel lined platter.  Scatter over 2 cloves of sliced garlic, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the lemon juice, put on a few torn basil leaves, and season it all with salt and pepper.  Set aside while you make the sauce.

Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Cook the onions until they are soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the chile, garlic, olives and a few hand-torn basil leaves.  Carefully add the tomatoes and a pinch of sugar; cook and stir until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 15 minutes.  Add the capers, taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.  Lower the heat, cover, and keep warm.

Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.  Add a couple of tablespoons of salt and the spaghetti.  Stir to make sure the pasta doesn't stick.  Cover and return to a boil.  Remove cover and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes, or until the spaghetti is al dente.  Drain and add the spaghetti to the tomato sauce.  Add the cheese and mix well.  Pile onto a platter and top it with the eggplant slices.  Garnish with more basil leaves.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Ancho Chile Rub -- (see recipe)
  1                     pork shoulder - (5 to 7 lbs) -- skin on
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        === SPICY GARLIC-LIME DRIZZLING SAUCE ===
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     jalapeÒos -- chopped
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1              bunch  fresh cilantro -- finely chopped
  2                     limes -- juiced
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the pork:  Rub the spice mix into the pork and set aside for 1 hour while you prepare the grill.  (You can marinate the pork longer under refrigeration, just make sure to bring it to room temperature before cooking it.)

Light the coals in a barbecue grill with a cover.  When the coals are hot, push them to 1 side of the grill.  Rub the pork with some olive oil and season it liberally with salt.  Put the pork on the grill away from the coals and place a drip pan underneath the meat.  Close the cover and cook, maintaining a medium low temperature, for about 4 to 6 hours, or until the meat shreds easily.  Turn the meat occasionally and baste with the drippings.

For The Drizzling Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth; taste and season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle over the shredded pork.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is sized for the home cook.  On the show in Dallas we cooked a large amount of pork using a Caja China roasting box.  Information on them can be obtained at lacajachina.com.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     large bunche collard greens
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     smoked ham hock
  2             quarts  chicken broth -- warm
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the greens, cut away the tough stalks and stems from the collards, and discard any leaves that are bruised or yellow.  Wash the collards thoroughly to remove the grit, 2 or 3 times, until the water runs clear.  Dry thoroughly.  Tear the leaves into large pieces.

Place a large pot over medium heat and add the olive oil.  Add the onion, garlic, bay leaves, and ham hock.  Cook until the onions are soft and starting to brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Pack in the greens, pushing them down into the pot.  Add the broth, vinegar, and sugar.

Bring up to a boil turning the greens over occasionally with a wooden spoon as they wilt.  Lower to a simmer, cover the pot, and let cook for 45 minutes.  Taste the "pot liquor" (broth) and check the seasoning, add salt and pepper.  Cover and let cook for 15 more minutes.  Remove the bay leaves and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     strips thick-cut bacon -- chopped
  2               cups  stone-ground white or yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  4              large  eggs
  2               cups  milk
  1                     canned chipotle chile -- drained, stemmed,
                        seeded and minced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Put the bacon into a cold 10-inch cast-iron pan and cook over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the bacon bits are crisp.  Do not let burn.  Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate.  Keep the bacon fat in the pan and set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In a separate bowl beat the eggs with a whisk until foamy; whisk in the milk.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined.  Fold in the bacon bits, chipotle, and chives.

Pour the batter into the cast-iron pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pasta Dough for Ravioli -- (see recipe)
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     container ricotta cheese - (15 oz)
  2                     balls fresh buffalo mozzarella - (8 oz ea) -- water drained, and
                        cheese shredded
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  2               cups  fresh baby spinach -- finely chopped
  1              large  egg
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     anchovy fillets
     1/2           cup  pitted kalamata olives
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil leaves
  2               cans  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make the pasta dough as directed in the master recipe.

To make the filling:  Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, stirring to incorporate.

To make the sauce:  Coat a wide saute pan with olive oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil gets hazy, add the onions, garlic, and anchovies; cook and stir for 5 minutes until fragrant and soft.  Add the olives, capers, and hand torn basil.  Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir over low heat, until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 24 ravioli.

To make the sauce:  Coat a wide saute pan with olive oil and place over medium heat.  When the oil gets hazy, add the onions, garlic, and anchovies; cook and stir for 5 minutes until fragrant and soft.  Add the olives, capers, and hand torn basil.  Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir over low heat, until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken wings
  1                cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  honey
                        Sesame seeds -- for garnish

Rinse chicken wings and pat dry.  Remove tip and discard; separate each wing at the joint into 2 pieces.  Place wings in a shallow dish and pour over the soy sauce, ginger, cilantro, garlic, and lemon juice.  Toss well to coat; marinate, refrigerated, for 2 hours.

Remove wings from marinade and pat dry; season with salt and pepper.  In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter in the olive oil.  When the butter stops foaming, add the honey and chicken wings and fry until browned on each side, about 5 minutes.  Continue cooking the wings, turning them over often to coat them as the glaze reduces.  Cook until the wings are sticky and cooked through.  Garnish with sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated fresh ginger
                        === POTSTICKERS ===
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seed oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced shallot
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     3/4         pound  stone crabmeat
  24                    round wonton wrappers
  4        tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  water -- for steaming

Make the dipping sauce:  In a small bowl combine vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger.  Set aside and allow the flavors to develop.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg white, vinegar, and sesame oil; season it with salt and pepper.  Add the ginger, shallot, scallion, and cilantro.  Pick over the crab to remove any stray bits of shell and to break up any large pieces.  Fold the crab meat into the egg white mixture.

Place 1 tablespoon of the crab mixture in the center of a wonton wrapper.  Moisten the edges with water and fold in half to create a half moon shape.  Pleat the edges between your fingers, making about 4 or 5 pleats.  Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.

In a medium sized, flat-bottom skillet, heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil over medium-high heat.  Add half the dumplings, pleat-side up, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until bottoms are golden brown.  Carefully add 1/4 cup water to pan, it can splatter.  Cover and steam dumplings for 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove cover and continue cooking until most of the water is evaporated.  Clean out pan and repeat.

Serve immediately with the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     baby eggplants
                        = (abt the size of lemons)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     shallots -- minced
  4                     garlic cloves
  2             pounds  ground lamb
  3              large  vine-ripe tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              small  fresh flat-leaf parsley bunch -- finely chopped,
                        reserve some for garnish
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh mint leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
  1                     lemon -- sliced paper-thin

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Using a paring knife, cut a wedge out of each eggplant, from stem to base, just large enough to stick a spoon inside and scoop out the flesh inside.  Discard the flesh you scoop out.

Coat a large saute pan with the oil and place over medium flame.  Lightly fry the eggplants on all sides, until slightly charred and blistered; remove to a platter and set aside.

Return the pan to the heat and add the shallots and garlic, saute for 5 minutes, until soft and golden brown.  Add the ground lamb to the pan and brown the meat well, breaking it up with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the tomatoes, combine well, and let simmer for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Toss in a couple of handfuls of the parsley, the mint, and lemon juice; continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the stuffing cool slightly.  Using a spoon, stuff the lamb filling into the eggplants until they feel full, but not overly packed.

Arrange the eggplants in a single layer in a large saucepan, pour the chicken stock over them and lay the lemon slices on top of each eggplant, drizzle with some more olive oil.  Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until fork tender.  Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                       Stuffed Cornbread - {Arepas}

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  arepa flour
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  1           teaspoon  canola oil -- plus
                        extra for cooking arepas

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, mix flour and salt.  Pour in water and mix with a spoon until the dough comes together.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes.  Remove dough from bowl and knead for about 5 minutes moistening your hands and the board with water as you work.  (Kneading in the additional moisture is an important step in making a tender arepa.)  The dough should be smooth and not crack around the edges; it should be moist but not sticky.

Form into disks about 3-inches around and 1/2-inch thick.  (The disks can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap at this point and cooked later.)

Add the oil to a non-stick pan over medium heat and cook arepas on each side just until a crust forms.  Do not let brown.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the arepas make a hollow sound when tapped.

Open a slit in 1 side of the arepa to make a pocket (or slice in half).  Arepas can be stuffed with meat, beans and plantains or your favorite filling.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 arepas.

Cook's note:  Arepa flour is a precooked corn flour and should not be confused with masa harina.  Arepa flour is sold as masarepa, harina precocida, or masa al instante.  It can be found in Latin American groceries.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh peas -- cooked
                        = (if using frozen, rinse under cool
                        water to thaw)
  8               cups  chicken stock -- heated
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  1                     celery stalk -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  2               cups  Arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1              pound  diver scallops

Put 1 cup peas and 1/3 cup chicken stock into a blender and blend until smooth; set aside.

Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat and pour in 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Add celery and shallots and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, until soft.  Stir in rice, making sure to coat all the rice grains with the oil.  Add wine and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.

Ladle in 1 cup of hot stock.  Using a wooden spoon, stir gently until most of the stock has been absorbed.  Keep adding stock, a cup at a time, and stirring.  After about 10 to 15 minutes, test the rice.  It should be cooked and creamy but still have a slight bite to it.  (You may not need all of the stock.)  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the butter and parmesan cheese.  Gently fold in the pea puree and remaining 1 cup whole peas.  Taste for seasoning.  Remove from the heat and cover while you sear the scallops.

Set a large non-stick saute pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.  Pat the scallops with paper towels to make sure they are very dry.  Season on both sides with salt and pepper.  Add scallops to pan, making sure not to overcrowd, and cook until they are nicely browned on both sides, about 4 to 8 minutes depending on the size of your scallops.

Check the risotto and add a bit more stock if it has gotten too thick.  In a shallow bowl or plate, make a nice mound of risotto and top with 3 or 4 scallops.  Garnish with the Spring Green Salad, parmesan cheese, and olive oil.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  rice vinegar
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
  1              pound  daikon radish
     1/4           cup  kosher salt

In a small saucepan over medium heat add the vinegar, water, sugar, and turmeric.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Remove from heat and allow it to cool.

Meanwhile, peel the daikon radish and slice into 1/4-inch thick rounds.  (If your daikon is very large, slice the rounds into semicircles.)  Place in a colander with salt and mix well.  Place the colander over a bowl and let drain for 1 hour.

Rinse the salt off with a couple of changes of water and dry the daikon well.  Put into a sterilized glass jar.  Pour the cooled brine through a coffee filter (or a cheesecloth lined strainer) into the jar to cover the radish slices.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.  Will keep for about 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh baby artichokes -- trimmed, quartered
  2                     tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  1                     lemon -- sliced thin
     1/2           cup  black olives
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil
  8             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     swordfish fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl combine the artichokes, tomatoes, lemon, olives, and herbs.  Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss together.

Take an 18-inch piece of aluminum foil and fold it in half crosswise.  Fold a 1-inch strip on each side over twice, once to close and once to seal; you should now have a pouch.  Repeat for 3 more pouches.

Season the fillets with salt and pepper and place 1 into each pouch.  Add 1/4 of the artichoke mixture to each pouch.  Fold over a 1-inch strip of the top twice to seal.  Place the packets onto a sheet pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fish.

Carefully open the pouches and place the fish and vegetables onto warm plates.  Spoon any juices that have accumulated over the fish.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     dried ancho peppers -- stemmed, seeded
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  sweet paprika
  2        tablespoons  whole coriander
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
  3             pounds  beef chuck -- cut 1" cubes
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     canned chipotle chile -- chopped
     1/2                jalapeÒo pepper -- chopped
  2               cans  whole tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- hand crushed
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  masa harina
                        Grated queso fresco -- for garnish
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish

In a small dry skillet over low heat add the ancho peppers, oregano, paprika, coriander, cumin, and chili powder.  Cook until they begin to smell, about 2 minutes.  Put the spices into a spice mill or food processor and grind until they are powdered.  Set aside.

Heat a large heavy-bottomed casserole over medium heat; add 3 tablespoons olive oil and the onions.  Cook until the onions are soft and beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes.

Pat the beef dry and season it with salt and pepper.  Add it to the pot and cook, stirring frequently, until it has browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Add 2 tablespoons of the toasted spice mix, the garlic, chipotle, jalapeÒo, tomatoes, cinnamon stick, and sugar.  Season with salt and stir well.

Add some hot water until the meat is just covered with liquid.  Return to the boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the meat and shred it with a fork.  Return it to the pot, stir in the masa harina, and cook for another 10 minutes, uncovered, to thicken.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  Serve with the queso fresco, cilantro, and lime for garnish.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2    tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  2                     scallions -- sliced thin
  1              pound  mixed wild mushrooms
                        = (such as chanterelle, crimini,
                        oyster, and shiitake)
  2               cups  shredded Napa cabbage
  1                     carrot -- grated
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
  2             ounces  bean thread noodles -- blanched, chopped
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  spring roll wrappers
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === MUSTARD DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  hot water
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Heat oil in a skillet or wok over high heat.  Add the garlic, ginger, and scallions and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and cook for another minute.  Add the cabbage and carrot and cook until the cabbage starts to wilt, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the hoisin and oyster sauces; toss to coat the mixture.  Remove from the heat and mix in the noodles, sprouts, and cilantro; season to taste with salt and pepper.  The filling should be moist but not wet.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Lay a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface on an angle so it looks like a diamond.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper and fold up to enclose the filling.  Fold in the 2 sides.  Paint the top seam of the wrapper with beaten egg.  Continue rolling up to form a tight cylinder.

Pour about 1-inch of oil in a skillet or wok and heat to 350 degrees.  Fry the spring rolls, turning to cook all sides, until browned, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm.  Serve with Mustard Dipping Sauce.

For the Mustard Sauce:  Mix all ingredients together and stir until the sugar dissolves.

This recipe yields 10 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  yellow tail snapper - (3 to 4 lbs) -- scaled, cleaned
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lemons -- sliced thin
  2                     shallots -- sliced thin
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  3        tablespoons  thyme leaves
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for oiling baking sheet
  4                     egg whites -- room temperature
  1                cup  kosher salt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Rinse the fish and pat dry; season it inside and out with salt and pepper.  In a mixing bowl, combine the lemon, shallot, parsley, 2 tablespoons thyme, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and 1/4-cup olive oil.  Place the fish on an oiled baking sheet and stuff the cavity with the lemon mixture.

In a clean mixing bowl, whip the egg whites until they form soft peaks.  Fold in the salt to make a paste then fold in the remaining thyme leaves.  Smear the salt paste over the entire fish and roast for 35 to 45 minutes.  The egg whites will form a hard crust.  Gently crack the shell with a spoon and lift off the salt crust.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
