Recipe By     :Triangle Ranch Bed & Breakfast, Philip, SD
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANCAKES ===
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
  2               cups  buttermilk (best) or sour milk (good)
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2        tablespoons  sugar - (to 3 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  3        tablespoons  melted shortening or oil
                        === CHEESE SPREAD ===
  4             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  2        tablespoons  oleo or butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar - (to 3 tbspns)

Use just one bowl.  Beat eggs, add buttermilk (with baking soda stirred in).  Stir -- add flour, sugar, salt and baking powder.  Stir.  Fold in shortening.  (Caution: Do Not overstir; Grandma says leave a few lumps.)

Lightly grease or spray with Pam a griddle heated to 375 degrees.  Spoon 4 inch circles of batter and turn when puffed up and full of little bubbles.  May add blueberries, or drained pineapple bits after batter is poured.  Smell has been known to wake grandsons from deep slumber!

For the Cheese Spread:  Beat all ingredients together until smooth with a a fork or wire wisk.

This recipe yields 12 to 15 pancakes.

Optional Filling:  2 large, tart apples (peeled and sliced).  Toss with 1/3 cup sugar, scant tablespoon flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, dash salt.  Saute mixture in small skillet with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon water until just tender.

Spread hot pancake, face-down, generously with cream cheese and spread and fill with 2 tablespoons of apple mixture.  Fold pancake "taco-style" or roll-up; dust with powdered sugar and serve accompanied by butter and maple syrup.  Fills about 8 pancakes.  M-m-m, forget the calories.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless trout -- heads and tails
                        removed
  4               cups  stale bread cut or ripped into 1" pieces
  1              small  yellow onion
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2                     celery stalks -- cut 1/2" dice
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  chicken stock -- or as needed
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3             dashes  Tabasco sauce
                        === LEMON-BUTTER SAUCE ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice

Saute the onions, celery, and garlic in the butter until the onions are just beginning to turn brown.  Add the chicken stock and seasoning to the pan and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.  Pour over the bread and stir until the bread is completely moistened.  If you need to add a little more stock to accomplish this, then do so.

Stuff the trout, using an eighth of the stuffing per fish.  Bake for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees or until the fish is cooked through.

Mix together melted butter and lemon juice and drizzle over the trout before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is Chef Rose Ludwig's favorite way to prepare a trout that someone has caught at the Fishin' hole.

                        (or 1 1/2 tspns dried thyme)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  boneless top sirloin beef -- trimmed of fat,
                        and cut into 12 cubes, 1 1/4" each
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  1              large  green bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  2               ears  fresh corn - (abt 6" ea) -- cut crosswise
                        into 4 pieces

                            Catamount Burgers

Recipe By     :Submitted by Mill Brook Bed & Breakfast, Brownsville, VT
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  thinly-sliced lean ham
     1/2         pound  Vermont Cheddar cheese -- grated
  10             drops  Louisiana Hot Sauce or Tabasco
     1/3           cup  real Vermont Maple syrup
  1                     Spray oil -- as needed

Spray a flat, short-sided baking pan with spray oil.  Make two alternating layers of ham and cheese; dot each layer with hot sauce and pour half of the maple syrup over each layer.

Cover and bake at 300 degrees until cheese melts or place in microwave for about 8 minutes until cheese melts.  Keep warm in a chafing dish (over hot water).

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  An adaptation of the Tiger Burger served at L.S.U. in 1959 (the year L.S.U. had the #1 football team in the U.S. and our innkeeper-cook was there).  It usually serves 8 to 10 but sometimes I have to make another recipe, thank goodness it is quick and easy to do so.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped bell peppers
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  2                     andouille links -- cut 1/4" slices
                        (or 3/4 lb other smoked sausage)
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 3/4" cubes
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2           cups  long grain rice
  3               cups  water
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot (with lid) over medium heat.  Add half the onions and bell peppers, the salt and cayenne.  Brown for about 15 minutes, scraping the browned bits from the bottom.

Add chicken and bay leaves and brown about 8 minutes.  Keep scraping pan bottom.

Add rice and cook several minutes, stirring often to coat.  Add the water, stir, and cover.  Cook on medium-low heat 30 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.  Remove from heat, add green onions, stir, cover, and let stand several minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Rockfish -- see * Note

                        Mayonnaise -- as needed
                        Finely-shredded cabbage
                        === BEER BATTER ===
  1                cup  flour
  1                     egg
     3/4           cup  beer
                        === SALSA ===
  3                     tomatoes or tomatillos
  1                     Anaheim chili
  1                     jalapeÒo
                        Garlic salt -- to taste
                        Chopped cilantro -- to taste

* Note:  Any rockfish will do for this recipe.  Take bones out of fish first!  Slice into strips and deep fry in beer batter.

Combine all beer batter ingredients.  Keep batter in a bowl of ice while using.

Take corn tortillas, fry, drain, and spread with mayonnaise on the sides.  Top with salsa and finely shredded cabbage.

For the Salsa:  Place first 3 ingredients in microwave in a plastic bag.  Cook 2 minutes until soft.  Remove and place these in a blender, then "zap" about 3 times.  (Don't pulverize, it needs to be chunky!)  Pour into a bowl, sprinkle with garlic salt and chopped cilantro to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE STOCK ===
  1                     goose, or 2 ducks or chicken carcasses
                        with any leftover skin
  2                     celery ribs -- snapped in thirds
  1                     onion -- halved
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     bay leaves
  4             quarts  cold water
                        === THE GUMBO ===
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  flour
  1              pound  andouille or smoked sausage -- sliced 1/4" thick
  2               cups  chopped onion
     2/3           cup  chopped green pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped green onion
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2             quarts  stock -- cooled, and
                        skimmed of fat
  3 1/2           cups  duck, goose, or chicken meat -- from broth
                        preparation and leftover roast
  3          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  thyme
  3                     bay leaves -- crushed

The Stock:  Place all ingredients in large stock pot.  Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered 2 1/2 hours.  Strain through a colander.  Reserve all meat, discard vegetables.  Pick off and reserve any meat from bones.  (Makes about 2 quarts)

The Gumbo:  Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy stock pot over medium heat.  When hot (test whether pinchfuls of flour sizzle) gradually add flour.  Stir constantly until the roux is the color of milk chocolate.

Add the sausage, onion, green pepper, green onions, parsley, and garlic.  Reduce heat to low and cook 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add 1/2 cup stock and the fowl meat and seasonings.  Mix thoroughly.

Add the rest of the stock, raise heat, and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes, stirring often.

Serve over boiled rice.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This recipe is great for leftover roast goose, duck, or chicken.  If making chicken stock, the carcass will yield less meat than goose or duck, so more leftover roast chicken will be needed to set aside.

  8             ounces  fresh swordfish steak - (to 10 oz)
  1                     tomato

       Macadamia Nut-Breaded Halibut With Coconut Curry Mango Sauc

Recipe By     :Submitted by Gourmet Fleurs Bed & Breakfast, Anchorage, AK
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh halibut -- cut into 4 filets
  7             ounces  roasted macadamia nuts
  2        tablespoons  flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  flour -- for dredging fish
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/3      teaspoon  cayenne
  4        tablespoons  butter -- (clarified butter
                        is necessary if cooking large quantities)
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz)
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1         tablespoon  Taste of Thai Red Curry Paste -- (start with less,
                        then taste to adjust - it is hot!)
     1/2           cup  Major Grey Chutney -- large chunks
                        chipped fine
  1                     fresh mango -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced small
  2        tablespoons  finely-sliced fresh cilantro -- (to 3 tbspns)

Combine nuts and 2 tablespoons flour in food processor, pulsing so as not to overchop and become sticky.  Beat cayenne into egg with a fork.  Dredge filet first in flour, then egg, then nuts -- pressing nuts onto fish.  Refrigerate breaded fish while starting sauce.

Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a heavy saucepan.  Add curry paste and cook one minute, whisking.  Add coconut milk and chutney, bring to a boil.  Boil lightly till milk is reduced to 1/2 its original volume or to desired thickness.  Turn heat off and cover to keep warm.

Melt butter in large saute pan over medium heat.  Add halibut till deep golden brown, turn to brown other side.  If filets are very thick, place in 400 degree oven for 8 minutes after browning to finish cooking.

Just before fish is done, add chopped mango and cilantro to sauce.  Serve sauce over fish sprinkled with a little more cilantro for color interest and perhaps a whole cilantro leaf.  Serve with Jasmine Rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     bluefish - (3 lbs ea) -- cleaned, leaving
                        the heads and tails intact
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  2              large  carrots -- sliced thin
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  5                     celery ribs -- sliced thin
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh dill
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh basil leaves
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter - (1/2 cup) -- melted
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine

Spoon three-fourths of the stuffing into  the fish, reshape the fish, pressing them closed, and arrange them cut-sides down in a baking dish just large enough to hold them.

Transfer them carefully with spatulas to a platter, and spoon the stuffing around them.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                       Native Wyoming Grilled Trout

Recipe By     :Submitted by Window On The Winds Bed & Breakfast, Pinedale, 
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     pan-size rainbow trout - (to 8)
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
  4          teaspoons  salt
     1/4    tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
     3/4           cup  margarine

Make three light slashes on each side of fish.  Combine lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Marinate fish in refrigerator all day.

To Bar-B-Que:  Toast sesame seeds until brown.  Add margarine and heat.  Drain lemon juice mixture from fish and add some to sesame seeds and butter.  Place fish in large folding wire grill basket or directly on grill.  Cook over medium coals about 5 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork.  Baste frequently with sesame seed mixture.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  It is really best to have a grill basket as the fish will stick to the grill and fall apart.   Spray either the basket or grill with a generous coating of non-stick spray.  We serve this for evening meals at the Bed & Breakfast.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     shallots -- finely diced
  1                cup  white wine
  2             sprigs  fresh dill or tarragon
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried dill or tarragon)
  1                cup  creme fraiche or whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  seedless red raspberry jam
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- kept cold
  1               pint  red raspberries -- fresh or frozen
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh dill or tarragon -- leaves only
                        (or 1 tspn dried dill weed or tarragon)

Put shallots in heavy sauce pan with wine and herbs.  Boil over medium heat until the liquid is reduced to 1 tablespoon or less.  Be careful to avoid boiling dry!

Add creme fraiche or whipping cream and continue to boil to reduce by 1/2.  Remove sprigs if you used fresh herbs.  Add raspberry jam and whisk into cream mixture.

Cut butter into tablespoon-size slices and over very low heat whisk the butter into the cream one tablespoon at a time, allowing each slice to melt into the sauce.  Continue until all butter is incorporated into sauce.

Add 1/2 of raspberries and whisk in.  Add herbs and whisk in.  Keep over very low heat until ready to serve.  (If sauce gets too hot, the butter will start to melt out.  If this happens, add 1 tablespoon of cold butter and whisk in to rebind sauce).

Just before serving, add remaining raspberries and gently stir in.  Serve over salmon, swordfish, or any firm white fish.  YUM!

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  You can buy creme fraiche in a gourmet deli or you can make your own.

                  Sauteed Trout With Herbed Breadcrumbs

Recipe By     :Submitted by Snowbird Mountain Lodge, Robbinsville, NC
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless trout filets - (to 6) -- with skin on
                        one side
  2              large  eggs
  1               dash  water
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Clarified butter or vegetable oil -- to saute with
                        === BREADCRUMBS ===
  1                     slightly-stale French loaf -- cut into cubes
  2               cups  fresh herbs (any combination of basil,
                        thyme, chives, oregano or parsley that
                        may be in your garden)
  1                cup  fresh spinach leaves -- washed and dried

In the bowl of a food processor combine the bread, herbs and spinach and process until you have chunky breadcrumbs -- you do not want powdery breadcrumbs.  You may have to process the bread and herbs in batches if the bowl or processor will not accommodate all the ingredients at once.  Spread the breadcrumbs out in a long roasting pan and set aside.

To bread the trout:  Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl large enough to accommodate the filets and add a dash of water to thin the eggs -- this is called an egg wash.  In a separate shallow bowl large enough to accommodate the filets, combine the flour, salt, and pepper.

Bread the filets by dredging them in the flour first (shake off excess flour), dipping them in the egg wash, and then dredging them in the breadcrumbs and pressing the breadcrumbs into the filet to ensure a good coating.

To saute the trout:  In a large saucepan placed over medium-high heat, heat the butter or oil.  Test the oil to see if it is ready to saute in by tossing in the a breadcrumb -- if the breadcrumb bubbles and jumps the oil is ready, but if the breadcrumb sits still the oil needs to get hotter.

When the oil is ready place the filets in the pan, flesh-side down, and saute until golden brown.  Turn the trout over and place the saute pan in a 350 degree oven to finish cooking, about 7 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This entree is by far the most popular dish served at the lodge and I have had more requests for this recipe than any other.  Serve the trout with citrus Beurre Blanc sauce, roasted red potatoes and steamed asparagus for one fabulous meal.  Note:  Any type of white, mildly-flavored fish that you prefer to use, as long as it is fresh, will work very well with this preparation.

Comments:  There are family recipes which are absolute "musts' for holiday occasions.  Every family has them.  Shoe Peg Corn Salad is always found at Thanksgiving at the Carrizal house (my sister and her family).  It also has been showing up at our annual family gatherings in Vail, Colorado every summer.  Now we think we cannot have a gathering without it.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Dark brown sugar
                        Rock salt
                        Fish -- cut into pieces
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Garlic salt
                        Liquid smoke old bay spice
                        Jalapeno juice & peppers
                        === IMPLEMENTS NEEDED ===
                        A square tupperware-type container with
                        lid 4" to 5" deep
                        Little Chef Smoker, 110 volt
                        Wood chips (alder, cherry, apple,
                        hickory) use one or mix.

Brine:  Layer the sliced fish, skin-side down in container.  Liberally sprinkle a handful and half of rock salt.  Spread 2 hefty handfuls of dark brown sugar over the fish (add optional ingredients if desired).  Repeat the process of layering fish and brine until the container is 3/4 full of fish.  This will allow for the expansion of fluid from the fish.  Keep in a cool, dry place as in a refrigerator.  Check after one day to see if it is to your taste and ready for smoking.

Smoking Process:  After pulling fish out of the brine, rinse lightly with tap water in container.  Place fish in smoker skin-side down.  Try to have continuity of size and thickness of fish.  Have your desired wood chips already in place.  Smoke for 25 to 30 minutes.  Let cool down for 15 to 20 minutes (unplug smoker).

Repeat, adding wood chips as needed.  Sample 2nd smoking after its cool down phase.  If not desired taste, smoke a third time.  Thicker pieces will need more cycles of smoking and cooling down (possibly up to 5 cycles).

Remember to smoke the fish, don't cook it!!  If the fish is too frozen after smoking, it may become somewhat drier in taste.  Experiment with small quantities to familiarize yourself with the smoking process.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1              small  whole fish (yellow tail, grunts, etc.) or

                          Teal Lake Walleye Pike

Recipe By     :Submitted by Ross' Teal Lake Lodge, Hayward, WI
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     walleye fillets -- fresh or frozen
  2               cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  salt
  3                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
                        Oil or shortening
  2               cups  cracker meal
  1                cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Frozen fillets from a commercial source should be skinned while still frozen and then thawed under cold running water.  Soak in a mixture of 2 cups milk and salt for at least 2 hours before serving.  Dry well.

Heat oil or shortening in deep pan or electric skillet until drips of water disappear instantly but not yet smoking.  (About 25 percent previously used fish oil is better... nobody seems to know why!)

Blend together eggs and 1 cup milk.  Mix cracker meal, flour, and salt and pepper to taste well in pan big enough to lay fish flat or in bag.  Dip fish in egg/milk mix, then roll or shake fish in cracker meal mix.  Let stand 5 minutes before frying.

Lay fish in hot oil, round-side up.  Keep some cold oil handy in case hot oil gets smoky or too hot.  Do not turn or flip fish.

Lift carefully with two spatulas when done.  Drain on paper towels or fabric.  Place on plate rounded-side up.  Garnish with tartar sauce (homemade is always best) and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Walleye, a mild freshwater fish, is native to the northern lakes.  It is game fish that you can catch on your own, but if it is served in a restaurant or bought in a store, Canadian commercial source is required.  This is how it is served by the fishing guides at a shorelunch on Teal Lake or in the dining room of Teal Lake Lodge every Friday.  ...Prudence Ross

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fennel seeds
  3        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  white peppercorns
  6                     fresh tuna steaks - (6 oz ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     3/4           cup  white wine
     1/4           cup  grated fresh ginger root
  8                     black peppercorns
  10       tablespoons  cold butter -- cut into 8 pieces
  1         tablespoon  pickled ginger

Grind the fennel, coriander and peppercorns with a mortar and pestle or in a spice grinder until fine.

Dip tuna in the spice mixture, coating both sides lightly.  Heat oil in a non-stick skillet until hot.  Saute tuna over medium heat to desired degree of doneness.

To make the Ginger Beurre Blanc Sauce, combine the shallots, vinegars, wine, ginger root and peppercorns in a small pan and reduce over medium heat to 3 tablespoons.

Strain the reduction into a clean pan, pressing hard on the solids to extract the liquid.  Over low heat add one tablespoon of butter and whisk constantly until melted.  Add another piece and continue in this manner until you've used all the butter.  Don't let the sauce get too hot or it will liquefy.

Add julienned pickled ginger and season to taste.  Top the tuna with some of the sauce and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.
