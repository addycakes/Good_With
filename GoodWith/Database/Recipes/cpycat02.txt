  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     chicken breast fillets
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  water
     1/3           cup  teriyaki sauce
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  mesquite liquid smoke flavoring
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  tequila
                        === MEXI-RANCH DRESSING ===
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  milk
  2          teaspoons  minced tomato
  1 1/2      teaspoons  white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  minced canned jalapeÒo slices -- (nacho slices)
  1           teaspoon  minced onion
     1/4      teaspoon  dried parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco pepper sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  dried dill weed
     1/8      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  chili powder
  1               dash  garlic powder
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  1                cup  shredded cheddar and monterey
                        jack cheese blend
  2               cups  crumbled corn chips or
                        fried tortilla strips

Prepare marinade by combining marinade ingredients in a medium bowl.  Add the chicken to the bowl, cover and chill for 2 to 3 hours. 
Make the Mexi-Ranch Dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a medium bowl.  Mix well until smooth, then cover dressing and chill it until needed. 
When you are ready to prepare the entree, preheat the oven to high broil.  Also, preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to high heat.  When the grill is hot cook the marinated chicken breasts for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until they're done. 
Arrange the cooked chicken in a baking pan.  Spread a layer of mexi-ranch dressing over each piece of chicken (you'll have plenty left over), followed by 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese blend.  Broil the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes, or just until the cheese has melted. 
Spread a bed of 1/2 cup of the tortilla strips or crumbled corn chips on each of four plates.  Slide a chicken breast onto the chips on each plate and serve with your choice of rice (Spanish rice is recommended), and pico de gallo, or salsa. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

NOTES : Tidbits - Crumbling store-bought tortilla chips is the easy way to make the bed of crunchy chips that the tequila lime chicken rests on.  But, you can make tortilla strips like those served at the restaurant by cutting a stack of eight 6-inch corn tortillas in half.  Stack the halves on top of each other and slice the tortillas into thin strips.  Fry the tortilla strips in 2 cups of oil preheated in a large skillet for 3 to 5 minutes or until crispy.  Salt lightly and cool on paper towels to drain.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  red potatoes
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  half-and-half or milk
  4                     garlic cloves -- roasted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

To really get their flavor, these potatoes need to be baked, not boiled.  So bake them in a 350 degree oven for about 20 to 30 minutes. 
This would be a great time to roast that garlic too.  You can either use a traditional roaster, or you may wrap a bulb of garlic in foil and roast that, be sure to coat the bulb with some olive oil before you roast it. 
Remove potatoes from oven and allow them to cool.  You can leave the peelings on or off, I like to leave a few of them on.  Chop potatoes, add butter, and half-and-half, and mix with with an electric mixture.  Add cloves of garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. 
You will want to heat these potatoes in a saucepan until they warm up again. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

To really get their flavor, these potatoes need to be baked, not boiled.  So bake them in a 350 degree oven for about 20 to 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This would be a great time to roast that garlic too.  You can either use a traditional roaster, or you may wrap a bulb of garlic in foil and roast that, be sure to coat the bulb with some olive oil before you roast it. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove potatoes from oven and allow them to cool.  You can leave the peelings on or off, I like to leave a few of them on.  Chop potatoes, add butter, and half-and-half, and mix with with an electric mixture.  Add cloves of garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
You will want to heat these potatoes in a saucepan until they warm up again. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4             medium  baking potatoes
     1/2           cup  shredded Colby cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  butter
  4                     egg yolks
  1 1/2      teaspoons  red wine vinegar
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2       teaspoon  water

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, skim and discard the milk solids from the top of the butter.  Hold the clarified butter over very low heat while preparing egg yolks. 
Place the egg yolks, vinegar, cayenne and salt in a large stainless steel bowl and whisk briefly.  Fill a saucepan or Dutch oven large enough to accommodate the bowl with about 1 inch of water.  Heat the water to just below the boiling point. 
Set the bowl in the pan over the water; do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl.  Whisk the egg yolk mixture until slightly thickened, then drizzle the clarified butter into the yolks, whisking constantly.  If the bottom of the bowl becomes hotter than warm to the touch, remove the bowl from the pan of water for a few seconds and let cool. 
When all of the butter is incorporated and the sauce is thick, beat in the water.  Serve the Hollandaise immediately or keep in a warm place at room temperature until used. 
This recipe yields 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable oil - (to 8 cups)
  1                     egg
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
  4                     chicken breast fillets
  4                     sesame seed hamburger buns
  4                     lettuce leaves
  4                     tomato slices
  4                     Kraft Swiss Cheese Singles
  8             slices  bacon -- cooked
                        === RANCH DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  buttermilk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  parsley
     1/8      teaspoon  onion powder
  1               dash  dill weed
  1               dash  garlic
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  hot water
     1/2      teaspoon  unflavored gelatin

Preheat 6 to 8 cups of oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees. 
To prepare the ranch dressing, combine all of the ingredients except the water and gelatin in small bowl.  Mix the water with the gelatin in a small cup until all of the gelatin is dissolved.  Add this gelatin solution to the other ingredients and stir.  Cover and chill the dressing until it's needed. 
Beat the egg and then combine with 1 cup water in a small, shallow bowl.  Stir.  Combine the flour, salt, onion powder and garlic powder in another shallow bowl. 
Pound each of the breast fillets with a mallet until about 1/4-inch thick.  Trim each breast fillet until it is round.  Working with one fillet at a time, first coat each fillet with the flour, then dredge it in the egg and water mixture.  Coat the chicken once again in the flour and set it aside until all of the fillets have been breaded. 
Fry the chicken fillets for 8 to 12 minutes or until light brown and crispy. 
As chicken is frying, prepare each sandwich by grilling the face of the hamburger buns on a hot skillet over medium heat.  Spread about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the ranch dressing on the face of the top and bottom buns.  On the bottom bun, stack a leaf of lettuce and a tomato slice. 
When the chicken is done frying, remove the fillets from the fryers and drain them on paper towels or a rack for a couple of minutes. 
Stack one fillet onto the bottom of the sandwich (onto the tomato), then stack a slice of the Swiss cheese onto the chicken.  Arrange the bacon, crosswise, on top of the Swiss cheese, then top off the sandwich with the top bun.  Repeat the stacking process for each of the remaining sandwiches.

Preheat 6 to 8 cups of oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the ranch dressing, combine all of the ingredients except the water and gelatin in small bowl.  Mix the water with the gelatin in a small cup until all of the gelatin is dissolved.  Add this gelatin solution to the other ingredients and stir.  Cover and chill the dressing until it&apos;s needed. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg and then combine with 1 cup water in a small, shallow bowl.  Stir.  Combine the flour, salt, onion powder and garlic powder in another shallow bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pound each of the breast fillets with a mallet until about 1/4-inch thick.  Trim each breast fillet until it is round.  Working with one fillet at a time, first coat each fillet with the flour, then dredge it in the egg and water mixture.  Coat the chicken once again in the flour and set it aside until all of the fillets have been breaded. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry the chicken fillets for 8 to 12 minutes or until light brown and crispy. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
As chicken is frying, prepare each sandwich by grilling the face of the hamburger buns on a hot skillet over medium heat.  Spread about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the ranch dressing on the face of the top and bottom buns.  On the bottom bun, stack a leaf of lettuce and a tomato slice. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the chicken is done frying, remove the fillets from the fryers and drain them on paper towels or a rack for a couple of minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stack one fillet onto the bottom of the sandwich (onto the tomato), then stack a slice of the Swiss cheese onto the chicken.  Arrange the bacon, crosswise, on top of the Swiss cheese, then top off the sandwich with the top bun.  Repeat the stacking process for each of the remaining sandwiches.

                Salsa

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  tomatoes
  10                    jalapeÒos (red is best)
     1/4        medium  Spanish onion
  2                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  mesquite-flavored liquid smoke

Preheat your barbecue grill to high temperature. 
Remove any stems from the tomatoes, then rub some oil over each tomato.  You can leave the stems on the jalapeÒos. 
Place the tomatoes on the grill when itís hot.  After about 10 minutes, place all of the jalapeÒos onto the grill.  In about 10 minutes you can turn the tomatoes and the peppers.  When almost the entire surface of the peppers has charred black you can remove them from the grill.  The tomatoes will turn partially black, but when the skin begins to come off they are done.  Put the peppers and tomatoes on a plate and let them cool. 
When the tomatoes and peppers have cooled, remove most of the skin from the tomatoes and place them into a food processor.  Pinch the stem end from each of the peppers and place them into the food processor as well.  Toss out the liquid that remains on the plate. 
Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor and puree on high speed for 5 to 10 seconds or until the mixture has a smooth consistency. 
Place the salsa into a covered container and chill for several hours or overnight while the flavors develop. 
This recipe yields approximately 2 cups.

  1               dash  dried dill weed
  1               dash  garlic powder
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  chopped tomato
  1         tablespoon  chopped onion

Preheat barbecue grill to high heat. 
Rub the chicken breast with some vegetable oil then grill it on the barbecue for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until done.  Lightly salt and pepper each side of the chicken while it cooks.  Set chicken aside until it cools down enough to handle. 
Preheat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the red pepper and onion to the pan and sautÈ for a couple minutes until tender. 
Dice the cooked chicken into small cubes and add it to the pan.  Add the corn, black beans, spinach, jalapeÒo peppers, parsley, cumin, chili powder, salt, and cayenne pepper to the pan.  Cook for another 4 minutes.  Stir well so that the spinach separates and is incorporated into the mixture. 
Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese.  Stir until the cheese is melted. 
Wrap the tortillas in a moist cloth and microwave on high temperature for 1 1/2 minutes or until hot. 
Spoon approximately one-fifth of the mixture into the center of a tortilla.  Fold in the ends and then roll the tortilla over the mixture.  Roll the tortilla very tight, then pierce with a toothpick to hold together.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients until you have five eggrolls. 
Arrange the eggrolls on a plate, cover the plate with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours.  Overnight is best. 
While the eggrolls freeze prepare the Avocado-Ranch Dipping Sauce by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl. 
Preheat 4 to 6 cups of oil to 375 degrees.  Deep-fry the eggrolls in the hot oil for 12 to 15 minutes and remove to paper towels or a rack to drain for about 2 minutes. 
Slice each eggroll diagonally lengthwise and arrange on a plate around a small bowl of the dipping sauce.  Garnish the dipping sauce with the chopped tomato and onion. 
This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

NOTES : Tidbit - This is a great recipe to have if you like Amaretto, since it's so much cheaper to make your own version at home.  Just get the cheapest vodka you can find and have an empty bottle on hand to store the stuff in.

<Note>
Tidbit - This is a great recipe to have if you like Amaretto, since it&apos;s so much cheaper to make your own version at home.  Just get the cheapest vodka you can find and have an empty bottle on hand to store the stuff in.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Deserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  graham crackers - (4 sections) -- not separated
  2                     Hershey milk chocolate bars - (1 1/2 oz
                        ea)
  16             large  marshmallows
  2        tablespoons  Hershey's chocolate syrup -- in squirt bottle

Preheat the broiler.  Arrange the graham crackers side by side on an oven-safe plate (such as ceramic).  You can also use a baking sheet. 
Stack the milk chocolate bars side by side on top of the graham crackers.  Arrange the marshmallows on the chcocolate in 4 rows -- 4 across, 4 down. 
Broil the dessert on the middle rack for 1 to 3 minutes or until the marshmallows turn light brown on top.  Remove the dessert from the oven.  If you used a baking sheet, carefully slide the dessert onto a serving plate. 
With the squirt bottle, immediately drizzle the chocolate syrup over the marshmallows in a sweeping back-and-forth motion.  Drizzle the chocolate diagonally across the dessert one way, and then the other, creating a cross-hatch pattern.  Allow the chocolate to over-shoot the dessert so that it creates a decorative pattern on the serving plate as well. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter-flavored shortening
  1                cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  beaten egg
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        an extra 1/4 cup reserved for rolling
     1/8      teaspoon  baking powder

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the shortening, sugar, vanilla, and salt with an electric mixer.  Add the egg and beat mixture until it's fluffy.  Add the baking soda and mix for about 20 seconds, then add the buttermilk and mix for an additional 30 seconds. 
In another bowl, combine the flour and baking powder.  Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and mix well with an electric mixer until flour is incorporated.  Roll the dough into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap and then chill it for 1 hour. 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Roll dough out on a well-floured surface to 1/8-inch thick and punch out cookies with a 1 1/2- to 2-inch cutter (a medium-size spice bottle lid works well). 
Arrange cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. 
This recipe yields 60 cookies.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
  1                     egg
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1 1/2           cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugars with an electric mixer on high speed.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat until smooth. 
In another bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda and cream of tartar.  Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix well. 
Preheat oven to 300 degrees while you let the dough rest for 30 to 60 minutes in the refrigerator.  In a small bowl combine the sugar with the cinnamon for the topping. 
Take about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the dough and roll it into a ball.  Roll this dough in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and press it onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Repeat for the remaining cookies. 
Bake the cookies for 12 to 14 minutes and no more.  The cookies may seem undercooked, but will continue to develop after they are removed from the oven.  When the cookies have cooled they should be soft and chewy in the middle. 
This recipe yields 16 to 18 cookies.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter (1 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  finely-minced coconut flakes

Preheat a frying pan over medium heat.  Lightly toast the both halves of the hamburger bun, face down in the pan.  Set aside. 
Separate the beef into two even portions, and form each half into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun.  Lightly salt each patty and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. 
Flip the patties over and immediately place two slices of cheese on each one.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. 
Assemble the burger in the following stacking order from the bottom up:  bottom bun;  dressing;  tomato;  lettuce;  beef patty with cheese; onion slice;  beef patty with cheese;  top bun. 
This recipe yields 1 hamburger.

NOTES : Tidbit - This is a recipe for making what I believe is the best hamburger in the world.  The secret to duplicating this and other fast-food burgers is getting the beef patties real thin -- about 1/4-inch-thick.  If you like, you can press the beef thin onto wax paper and freeze the patties ahead of time.  This makes them easier to work with on the hot pan.

                     KFC's Extra Tasty Crispy Chicken

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  frying chicken -- cut up
  6               cups  vegetable oil - (to 8 cups)
                        === MARINADE ===
  4               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  MSG
                        === COATING ===
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  MSG

Trim any excess skin and fat from the chicken pieces.  Preheat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees. 
Combine the water, salt and MSG for the marinade in a large bowl.  Add the chicken to the bowl and let it sit for 20 minutes.  Turn the chicken a couple times as it marinates. 
Combine the beaten egg and milk in a medium bowl.  In another medium bowl, combine the remaining coating ingredients (flour, salt, pepper and MSG). 
When the chicken has marinated, transfer each piece to paper towels so that excess liquid can drain off.  Working with one piece at a time, first coat the chicken with the dry flour mixture, then the egg and milk mixture, and then back into the flour.  Be sure that each piece is coated very generously.  Stack the chicken on a plate or cookie sheet until each piece has been coated. 
Drop the chicken, one piece at a time into the hot oil.  Fry half of the chicken at a time (4 pieces) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until it is golden brown.  You should be sure to stir the chicken around halfway through the cooking time so that each piece cooks evenly. 
Remove the chicken to a rack or towels to drain for about 5 minutes before eating. 
This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings (8 pieces of chicken).

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable oil - (to 8 cups)
  20                    chicken wing pieces
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  MSG
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/4            cup  ketchup
     1/3           cup  white vinegar
     1/4           cup  molasses
     1/4           cup  honey
  1           teaspoon  liquid smoke flavoring
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Stir until ingredients are well-combined and bring to a boil.  Then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes. 
As sauce is simmering, heat up 6 to 8 cups of oil in a deep fryer set to 350 degrees.  Combine the beaten egg with the milk in a small bowl.  In another small bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper and MSG. 
When oil is hot, dip each wing first in the flour mixture, then into the milk and egg mixture, and back into the flour.  Arrange wings on a plate until each one is breaded. 
Fry the wings in the oil for 9 to 12 minutes or until light, golden brown.  If you have a small fryer, you may wish to fry 10 of the wings at a time.  Drain on paper towels or a rack. 
When the sauce is done, brush the entire surface of each wing with a light coating of sauce.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings (20 wings).

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               dash  salt

Lightly peel the potatoes (you don't have to get all of the skin off) then chop them into bite-size pieces and boil in 6 cups of boiling, salted water for 7 to 10 minutes.  The potato chucks should be tender, yet slightly tough in the middle when done.  Drain and rinse potatoes with cold water. 
In a medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth.  Poured drained potatoes into a large bowl.  Pour the dressing over the potatoes and mix until well-combined.  Cover and chill for at least 4 hours.  Overnight is best. 
This recipe yields 6 cups (about 8 servings).

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  corn syrup
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1 1/3           bags  plain or natural-flavored microwave
                        popcorn
     1/2           cup  roasted almonds

Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, water and salt in a large saucepan over medium heat.  You're going to bring the candy to 265 to 275 degrees, or what is known as the hard ball stage.  For this it's best to use a candy thermometer.  If you don't have one, don't worry.  Drip the candy into a small glass of cold water.  If the candy forms a very hard, yet slightly pliable ball, bingo, you're there.  Watch your mixture closely so that it doesn't boil over. 
While candy cooks, pop both bags of popcorn and spread about 2 quarts or 1 1/3 bags of popcorn plus almonds on one large or two small cookie sheets.  Put the popcorn in your oven set on its lowest temperature.  This will keep the popcorn hot so that the candy will coat better. 
When your candy has reached the hard ball stage, add the vanilla.  Pull the popcorn from the oven and, working quickly, pour the candy over the popcorn in thin streams.  Mix the popcorn so that each kernel is coated with candy, put the popcorn back into the oven for five more minutes, then stir once again.  This will help to coat each kernel.  You can repeat this step once more if necessary to get all of the popcorn coated.  Pour popcorn onto a large sheet of wax paper to cool.  Spread the popcorn out, but be careful -- it's hot. 
When popcorn is cool, break it up and immediately put it into a tightly sealed container, such as Tupperware.  This will ensure that it stays fresh.  This stuff gets stale very quickly in moist climates if left out. 
This recipe yields about 4 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIES ===
  1                cup  margarine
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1 1/2           cups  Quaker Oats (minute)
                        === CREME FILLING ===
  2          teaspoons  very hot water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  marshmallow creme - (7 oz jar)
     1/2           cup  shortening
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
In a large bowl, cream together margarine, sugars, molasses, vanilla and eggs.  In a separate bowl combine the flour, salt, baking soda and cinnamon.  Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients.  Mix in the oats. 
Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies are just starting to darken around the edges.  They will still appear moist in the center.  Be careful not to overcook -- when cooled, the cookies should be soft and chewy. 
While the cookies bake, prepare the filling.  Use a small bowl to dissolve the salt in 2 teaspoons of very hot water.  Set this solution aside to cool. 
Combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy.  Add the cooled salt solution to the filling mixture and combine with the mixer. 
Assemble each creme pie by spreading the filling over one side of a cookie (the flat side) and press another cookie on top, making a sandwich.  Repeat for the remaining cookies and filling. 
This recipe yields 2 dozen creme pies.

Recipe By     :Karen Barker, pastry chef, Magnolia Grill, Durham, NC
Serving Size  : 36    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  heavy cream
  12            ounces  good-quality semi-sweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter -- at room temperature
     1/4           cup  cognac
                        === COATINGS ===
                        Dutch-process cocoa -- or
  1 1/4         pounds  semi-sweet chocolate -- chopped, melted

Heat the cream in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until just before boiling.  Remove from the heat and stir in chopped chocolate until melted. 
Add the butter and cognac and stir well.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a ceramic or glass dish.  Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours (or overnight) until set (it will have the consistency of soft fudge). 
Using a large melon baller, scoop into tablespoon-sized balls. 
For cocoa coated balls:  Coat your hands with cocoa and roll each ball until well coated.  Place on a parchment paper covered baking sheet and freeze for 10 minutes.  Serve at once. 
For chocolate-dipped balls:  Heat 1 1/4 pounds semi-sweet chocolate until just melted.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  Carefully dip each truffle into melted chocolate.  Place on a parchment paper covered baking sheet, refrigerate to allow chocolate to set.  Serve after chocolate has set to personal preference. 
Refrigerate any leftover truffles to maintain texture. 
This recipe yields about 3 dozen 1-inch diameter truffles. 
Per truffle:  70 calories;  5 grams fat (64 percent calories from fat);  5 milligrams cholesterol;  1 grams protein;  6 grams carbohydrate;  11 milligrams sodium.

               Magnolia Grill's Cream Of Vidalia Onion Soup

Recipe By     :Ben Barker, chef-owner, Magnolia Grill, Durham, NC
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  smoked country bacon -- julienned
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  3             pounds  Vidalia or other sweet onions -- thinly sliced
  8                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1              quart  chicken stock (preferably homemade)
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried)
  1                cup  creme fraiche, heavy cream or sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste,
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
  1               dash  fresh lemon juice -- (optional)
  2               cups  homemade croutons
  3        tablespoons  snipped chives -- for garnish
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chive blossoms -- for garnish

In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon slowly until crisp.  With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon to a plate covered with paper towels, set aside. 
Add butter, onions and garlic to the pan, cover and cook over low heat, stirring often, until onions are translucent and slightly caramelized.  Add the wine, stock, bay leaf and thyme; bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. 
Remove the bay leaf and puree the soup in a food processor or blender.  Process in batches, if necessary.  If a smoother texture is desired, pass the soup through the fine blade of a food mill or press through a fine mesh sieve.  Chill completely. 
When soup is chilled, whisk in the creme fraiche, cream or sour cream.  Taste, then season with salt, white pepper, hot pepper sauce, nutmeg and dash of lemon juice, if desired.  Serve chilled in bowls.  Garnish with reserved bacon, croutons, chives and optional chive blossoms. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

NOTES : Tidbit - Yes, this actually exists.  On an excursion through some New England states I practically drove off the road when I first saw a sign advertising lobster at this fast food chain.  I just had to get a closer look.  That's when I discovered that this unique sandwich is served only at select McDonald's locations, mostly in Maine, for a limited time only during the summer months.  It's basically a lobster salad served on a hoagie roll with some lettuce, but with fresh Maine lobster, is quite tasty.
   Since you can't get this anywhere else, I figured this sandwich was a prime candidate for kitchen cloning.

NOTES : Tidbits - The original recipe here and in the books includes real egg white, but, after many suggestions from readers I have replaced that with 1/4 cup egg substitute, which is mostly egg white and does a great job of making the drink foamy.  If you like, you can instead use 2 tablespoons of the drink foam product Frothee.  This is available in many supermarket liquor sections or in liquor stores.  Or, if it's all you've got available, you can still use 1 egg white from a large egg as originally specified in the recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/8         pound  ground beef
  1              small  sesame seed bun
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1           teaspoon  sweet pickle relish
     1/2      teaspoon  yellow mustard

Pat out the ground beef until about the same diameter as the bun.  If you like, you can freeze this patty ahead of time to help keep the burger from falling apart when you cook it. 
Brown or toast the faces of the top and bottom buns.  You can do this in a frying pan over medium heat or by toasting them in the oven (or toaster oven). 
As the buns are browning, grill the hamburger patty, either in a hot frying pan over medium heat -- or you can use a barbecue grill.  Salt the meat generously. 
Combine the ketchup, relish and mustard in a small bowl.  When the meat is cooked to your liking, place it on the face of the bottom bun.  Slather the sauce on the face of the top bun and place it onto the meat.  Ta-da -- Sauceburger! 
This recipe yields 1 burger.

This little drive-thru developed this simple sauce -- a combination of ketchup, mustard and relish -- that makes quick production of scores of these tasty sandwiches a breeze when the line of cars grows long.  Yes, it's easy -- it's also very good on any burger at your next cookout.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced water chestnuts
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped green onion - (rounded)
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  5          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  arrowroot
                        === CHICKEN ===
  4                     chicken breast fillets
  1                cup  ice water
  1                     egg
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  unsifted cake flour
  2               cups  vegetable oil - (to 4 cups)

Combine all of the sauce ingredients -- except the cornstarch and arrowroot -- in a small saucepan over high heat.  Stir often while bringing mixture to a boil.  When sauce reaches a boil, remove it from heat and allow it to cool a bit, uncovered. 
Slice chicken breasts into bite-size chunks.  Remove exactly 1 cup of the marinade from the pan and pour it over the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or other container which allows the chicken to be completely covered with the marinade.  Chicken should marinate for at least a couple hours.  Cover remaining sauce and leave it to cool until the chicken is ready. 
When chicken has marinated, preheat 2-inches of vegetable oil in a wok or skillet to 350 degrees. 
Combine cornstarch with arrowroot in a small bowl, then add 3 tablespoons of water.  Stir until cornstarch and arrowroot have dissolved.  Pour this mixture into the sauce and set the pan over high heat.  When sauce begins to bubble and thickens cover and remove from heat. 
Beat together the ice water and egg in a medium bowl.  Add baking soda and salt.  Add 3/4 cup of the flour and stir with a fork just until the flour is blended into the mixture.  The batter should still be lumpy. 
Sprinkle another 1/4 cup of flour on top of the batter and mix with only one or two strokes.  Most of this flour will still be floating on top of the mixture.  Put the remaining flour (1/2 cup) into a medium bowl. 
Dip each piece of chicken first into the flour, then into the batter.  Let some of the batter drip off and then slide the chicken into the oil.  Fry up to 1/2 of the chicken pieces at a time for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown.  Flip the chicken over halfway through the cooking time.  Remove the chicken to a rack or paper towels to drain. 
As the chicken cooks, reheat the sauce left covered on the stove.  Stir occasionally. 
When all of the chicken is done, pour it into a large bowl, and cover with the thickened sauce.  Stir gently until all of the pieces are well coated. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                     Planet Hollywood's Pot Stickers

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  ground turkey
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced green onion
  1           teaspoon  minced water chestnuts
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes (no seeds)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  12                    wonton wrappers - (3" by 3" size) -- see * Note
                        Hoisin sauce -- on the side

* Note:  If you can't find wonton wrappers, you can also use eggroll wrappers for this recipe.  Eggroll wrappers are much bigger, so you will be wasting more of the dough when you trim the wrappers to 3-inch diameter circles.  But in a pinch, this is a quick solution.      Pot sticker wrappers can also be found in some supermarkets, but I've found the wonton wrappers and eggroll wrappers, when fried, taste more like the restaurant version. 
In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients except the egg, wrappers and oil.  Add 1 tablespoon of the beaten egg.  Save the rest of the egg for later.  Preheat oil in a deep fryer or a deep saucepan to 375 degrees.  Use enough oil to cover the pot stickers -- 1 to 2 inches should be enough. 
Invert a small bowl or glass with a 3-inch diameter on the center of a wonton wrapper and cut around it to make a circle.  Repeat for the remaining wrappers. 
Spoon 1/2 tablespoon of the turkey filling into the center of one wrapper.  Brush a little beaten egg around half of the edge of the wrapper and fold the wrapper over the filling.  Gather the wrapper as you seal it so that it is crinkled around the edge.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients. 
Deep-fry the pot stickers, six at a time in the hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes or until they are brown.  Drain on a rack or paper towels.  Serve with hoisin sauce for dipping.  If you want, add some crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper to the sauce. 
This recipe yields 3 to 4 appetizer servings.

NOTES : Tidbits - Here's a special recipe from one of the most popular theme restaurant chains.  Pot stickers are a popular Asian dumpling that can be fried, steamed, or simmered in a broth.  Planet Hollywood has customized its version to make them crunchier than the traditional dish, and it's a tasty twist that I'm sure you'll love.  Since hoisin sauce would be very difficult to make from scratch, you can use a commercial brand found in most stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  half-and-half
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  cream cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Parmagganio-Romano - (to 3/4 cup)
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  4                     crab legs - (to 6)
                        Hot cooked pasta -- for serving

In a saucepan melt butter.  When butter is melted add the cream cheese.  When the cream cheese is softened add heavy cream and the Parmesan Cheese.  Add garlic powder, and stir well.  Simmer this for 15 to 20 minutes on low.  You may wish to season with a little salt and pepper.

NOTES : Buy a good brand name Parmagganio-Romano cheese for this, preferably a brand that runs about 9 to 12 dollars per pound, but let me assure you it makes all of the difference.  Also use unsalted butter.

Once again, a true person would not use the cream cheese, but it does help thicken the sauce up, without much difference to the taste, you can omit it, just be prepared to stay with the sauce a little longer to thicken it.

                   Red Lobster's Grilled Shrimp Kabobs

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish                       Shrimp


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  melted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1             medium  onion - cut into 1/2" wedges
  2             medium  tomatoes -- cut into wedges
  2             medium  zucchini -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  36                    shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        with tail left on
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine melted butter and garlic; reserve. 
Peel the onion and cut from top to bottom.  Place cut-side down and cut each half into six wedges (widest part of the onion should be 1/2-inch).  Break wedges apart so two or three layers of onion stay  together.  Steam the onions approximately 3 minutes to soften slightly. 
Remove the core from the tomatoes.  Slice the tomatoes in half from top to bottom.  Place cut-side down and cut each half into three wedges.  Remove the pulp and seeds from each wedge. 
Cut zucchini into 1/2 slices.  Cut small slices (1 1/2-inches diameter or less) into two pieces; cut large slices (over 1 1/2-inches diameter) into three pieces lengthwise (do not cut into wedges). 
Thread items onto skewer in this order, three shrimp (about 1/2-inch from the thick end), onion wedge, zucchini, tomato, three shrimp, onion wedge, zucchini, tomato, three shrimp. 
Brush skewers with butter mixture.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate until ready to cook. 
Lightly brush charcoal grill rack with oil, place skewer on grill rack and cook over medium coals until shrimp are done and vegetables cooked, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Turn once or twice while cooking to prevent burning.  Or, place on broiler pan.  Broil about 4 inches from source of heat for 8 minutes, turning once while cooking. 
This recipe yields 4 kabobs.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  Red Lobster Cocktail Shrimp Party Platter
  1 1/4           cups  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  drained capers -- chopped

  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1              large  cucumber

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            pounds  pre-cooked shrimp - (41/50 size)
  2              boxes  lobster picks or fancy plastic toothpicks
  12             whole  pineapples
  1                     wide-base flower pot (or plastic bucket)
                        with a flat bottom, filled with concrete,
                        with a 4 ft. pliable copper pole in the
                        middle
  1              quart  cocktail sauce
  2                     tablecloths or beach towels to wrap
                        around base
  10                    palm fronds - (to 20) or plastic palm
                        fronds (available at most craft stores)

Cut the top and bottom off the pineapples, then take a sharpening steel (used to sharpen knives) to pierce a hole lengthwise through the pineapples. 
Put the pineapples on the coper pole; turn the pineapples so they fit snugly together. 
Put a piece of shrimp on a lobster pick (fancy plastic toothpick) and place it at the top of the tree (do not push the toothpicks all the way in; they should be easy to remove). 
Continue doing this in a spiral pattern until you reach the bottom of the tree.  Start the second row of shrimp just below the first and continue until you reach the bottom of the tree. 
Stick the palm fronds in the top of the tree. 
This recipe yields 20 servings.

                        high)
                        Toothpicks

NOTES : Tidbit -  Here's the signature drink from the chain that's reviving the drive-up burger joint, just like a scene out of American Graffitti or Happy Days.  At this growing chain you pull up to a stall and servers bring food out to your car as they did in the 40's and 50's.  This recipe makes a simple old-fashioned drink by combining 7-Up with cherry juice and some wedges of lime.  Very refreshing!

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder (Spanish blend is best)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried minced onion
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  1               dash  garlic powder
  1               dash  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  water
  8              small  flour tortillas - (6" dia)
  1                cup  Crisco shortening or cooking oil
  1                can  refried beans - (16 oz)
     1/3           cup  diced tomato
     2/3           cup  mild Picante salsa
     1/2           cup  shredded cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  shredded Monterey jack cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  sliced black olives

In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the flour, chili powder, salt, dried onion, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder.  Use your hands to thoroughly incorporate everything into the ground beef. 
Preheat a skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef mixture to the pan along with the water.  Brown the beef mixture for 5 to 6 miutes, using a wooden spoon or spatula to break up the meat as it cooks. 
Heat oil or Crisco shortening in a frying pan over medium-high heat.  If oil begins to smoke, it is too hot.  When oil is hot, fry each tortilla for about 30 to 45 seconds per side and set aside on paper towels.  When frying each tortilla, be sure to pop any bubbles that form so that tortilla lays flat in oil.  Tortillas should become golden brown. 
Heat up refried beans in a small pan over the stove or in the microwave.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
When meat and tortillas are done, stack each pizza by first spreading about 1/3 cup refried beans on the face of one tortilla.  Next spread 1/4 to 1/3 cup of meat, then another tortilla.  Coat your pizzas with two tablespoons of salsa on each then split up the tomatoes and stack them on top.  Next divide up the cheese, onions and olives, stacking in that order. 
Place pizzas in your hot oven for 8 to 12 minutes or until cheese on top is melted. 
This recipe yields 4 pizzas.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean ground beef
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried minced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
  1               dash  garlic powder
     1/2           cup  water
  1                can  refried beans - (16 oz)
  8                     ten-inch flour tortillas
     1/2           cup  enchilada sauce
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  2               cups  shredded lettuce
  2               cups  shredded cheddar cheese
  1             medium  tomato -- diced
     1/2           cup  diced yellow onion

In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the flour, chili powder, salt, minced onion, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients into the ground beef. 
Add the seasoned beef mixture to the water in a skillet over medium heat.  Mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula, and break up the meat as it cooks.  Heat for 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned.  The finished product should be very smooth, somewhat pasty, with no large chunks of beef remaining. 
Heat up the refried beans in a covered container in the microwave set on high temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. 
Place the flour tortillas on a plate and cover with plastic wrap.  Heat the tortillas for 30 to 45 seconds in the microwave on high temperature. 
Build each burrito by first spreading about 1/4 cup of refried beans on the center of a heated flour tortilla.  Spread one-eighth of the meat mixture over the beans, then pour about a tablespoon of the enchilada sauce over the meat. 
Stir the sour cream well, so that it is smoother, then spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons onto the burrito.  Arrange some of the lettuce, cheese, tomato and onion onto the tortilla, and then you're ready to roll. 
Fold the end of the tortilla closest to you over the filling ingredients.  Fold either the left or right end over next.  Then fold the top edge over the filling.  You will be leaving one end of the burrito open and unfolded.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 8 burritos.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean ground beef
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried minced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
  1               dash  garlic powder
     1/2           cup  water
  12                    taco shells
  2               cups  shredded lettuce
  1                cup  shredded cheddar cheese

In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the flour, chili powder, salt, minced onion, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients into the ground beef. 
Add the seasoned beef mixture to the water in a skillet over medium heat.  Mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula, and break up the meat as it cooks.  Heat for 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned.  The finished product should be very smooth, somewhat pasty, with no large chunks of beef remaining. 
Heat up the taco shells in a 375 degree oven for about 5 minutes. 
Build each taco by spooning 2 to 3 tablespoons of the meat into a warm shell.  Spread some of the shredded lettuce over the meat and then sprinkle some cheese over the top.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 12 tacos.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable oil - (to 8 cups)
     1/3           cup  Frank's Original Red Hot Pepper Sauce
     2/3           cup  water
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  4          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  coarse-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
  4                     chicken breast fillets
  4                     plain hamburger buns
  8          teaspoons  mayonnaise
  4                     lettuce leaves
  4                     tomato slices

Preheat 6 to 8 cups of oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees. 
Combine the pepper sauce and water in a small bowl.  Combine the flour, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, onion powder, paprika and garlic powder in another shallow bowl. 
Pound each of the chicken pieces with a mallet until about 3/8-inch thick.  Trim each breast fillet if necessary to help it fit on the bun. 
Working with one fillet at a time, coat each piece with the flour, then dredge it in the diluted pepper sauce.  Coat the chicken once again in the flour mixture and set it aside until the rest of the chicken is breaded. 
Fry the chicken fillets for 8 to 12 minutes or until they are light brown and crispy.  Remove the chicken to a rack or to paper towels to drain. 
As chicken is frying, prepare each sandwich by grilling the face of the hamburger buns on a hot skillet over medium heat.  Spread about 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise on the face of each of the inverted top buns.  Place a tomato slice onto the mayonnaise, then stack a leaf of lettuce on top of the tomato. 
On each of the bottom buns, stack one piece of chicken.  Flip the top half of each sandwich onto the bottom half and serve hot. 
This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.
